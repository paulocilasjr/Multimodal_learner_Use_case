Clinically as well as sonographically and computed tomography cT3 cN2b. In addition, nodular goiter on both sides with nodes > 2 cm each. All common tumor options (surgery versus primary radiochemotherapy) were discussed in detail with the patient in advance. There is now an indication for surgical treatment in the form of a laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy, neck dissection on both sides and hemi-thyroidectomy. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carrying out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Induction of anesthesia and orotracheal intubation of the patient. Initial positioning of the patient by the surgeon. First, a new panendoscopy is performed to plan the surgical procedure. Insertion of the mouth guard and insertion of the size C small bore tube. This confirms the size expansion described above. Subsequent placement of a nasogastric feeding tube without any problems. Positioning of the patient in head reclination. Superficial skin disinfection. Infiltration anesthesia with a total of 15 ml xylocaine with adrenaline added in the area of the incision for the planned apron flap. Subsequent ablation of the surgical area and sterile draping. First mark the planned incision. Skin incision and lifting of a broad-based apron flap, with strictly subplatysmal preparation. Insertion of the chain dog. First start of neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle as the caudal border and the posterior digastric venter muscle as the cranial border. Expose the capsule of the submandibular gland. Turning to the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the internal jugular vein and the venous angle including protection of the facial vein. Exposure of the common carotid artery, the bifurcation and the internal and external carotid artery. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. The cervical artery cannot be spared intraoperatively. An extensive metastatic conglomerate can now be seen in levels II and III up to just before level IV, which appears to be firmly attached to the surrounding area. The soft tissue metastasis can only be separated from the internal jugular vein with difficulty. The metastatic conglomerate extends very far medially and reaches the vagus nerve. Therefore, first relocation, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve. This can be spared. Intraoperatively, the border cord appears to be firmly attached to the metastatic conglomerate. First develop the lateral neck preparation, whereby the cervical plexus branches can largely be spared here. Turn to the medial neck preparation. The hypoglossal nerve is also exposed here. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve. Protection of the nerve. Successive development of the medial neck preparation. Moving on to the left side: the same procedure in principle here. First expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle as the caudal border and the posterior digastric venter muscle as the cranial border. Turning to the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the internal jugular vein from the caudal to the cranial border. Exposure of the facial vein and protection of the same. Exposure of the common carotid artery, the bifurcation and the internal and external carotid artery. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the same. Protection of the nerve. Development of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the cervical plexus branches. Exposure of the submandibular gland capsule and the hypoglossal nerve. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the nerve. Development of the medial neck preparation. Transition to visualization of the hypoid. Subsequent separation of the infrahyoid muscles using the electric knife. The sternohyoid muscle is cut caudally. Then supply the upper laryngeal bundle on both sides. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage horn on the left side. Incision of the perichondrium and release of the left-sided piriform sinus with the raspatory as well as with the pedicle swab. Subsequent exposure of the trachea and the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the isthmus and repositioning of the isthmus. Exposure, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve. This shows the large thyroid nodus described by sonography and computed tomography. Due to the prominent left-sided thyroid lobe and the slightly suspicious intraoperative appearance of the nodule, the decision was made to perform a hemithyroidectomy on the left side. Care is taken to preserve the epithelial bodies. The ventral trachea is then exposed. Proceed to the tracheotomy. Enter below the 1st tracheal clasp and transfer to an LE tube. Then open the pharynx infrahyoidally in the median line. Expose the upper edge of the epiglottis. Grasp the epiglottis and dislocate it through a relatively small pharyngotomy. You now have a good view of the extent of the tumor. First start resection in the area of the left-sided aryepiglottic fold. Mucosa-sparing incision up to just before the arytenoid cartilage. Then widen the incision caudally and in the area of the postcricoid. Hemostasis of several small bleedings from the laryngopharyngeal plexus. Subsequent counter-preparation from the left side. Here, too, the incision is made in the area of the aryepiglottic fold, whereby this is extended into the pharynx due to the tumor extension into the right-sided piriform sinus. In between, further release of the laryngeal skeleton with the attached soft tissue cuff. Deposition of the trachea at the level of the 1st tracheal cartilage and resection of the larynx and the right-sided piriform sinus in toto. The specimen is sent in thread-marked for definitive histology. Meticulous inspection of the tumor specimen and subsequent removal of corresponding marginal samples, which are sent for intraoperative frozen section diagnostics. In the meantime, meticulous hemostasis. Announcement of the intraoperative frozen section diagnosis: This shows a tumor-free resection margin, which is why an R0 situation can be assumed intraoperatively. Perform a rather restrained myotomy in the area of the upper esophageal sphincter so as not to provoke reflux problems postoperatively. The placement of a Provox prosthesis is deliberately avoided for the time being due to the relatively narrow remaining pharyngeal tube. Dissection of the left-sided sternal part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This results in slightly more severe venous bleeding, which can be stopped with the aid of three inversion stitches. Then perform the inverting pharyngeal suture with Vicryl 3.0 RB-1 using the single-button suture technique. This is performed in a T-shaped configuration. Extremely meticulous work is carried out at the base of the tongue and caudally at the level of the stoma in order to further reduce the risk of fistula formation at these predilection sites. Grasping the lateral musculature and suturing it using a continuous overlocking suture technique in the sense of a second layer. Application of a layer of TachoSil. Grasping of the remaining peripheral soft tissue, which is additionally stitched over the pharyngeal suture as a fourth layer. The sternohyoid muscle, which has previously been folded caudally, is also stitched over the wound bed. Then irrigate the wound with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Insertion of two 10-gauge Redon drains and circular epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Subcutaneous suturing with Vicryl 4.0 and skin suturing with Ethilon 5.0. Application of a pressure dressing and transfer of the patient to a 10-gauge high-volume low-pressure cannula. Completion of the procedure without complications. Final consultation with the anesthesia department. The patient received 3 g Unacid i.v. intraoperatively. Antibiotics should be continued postoperatively for five days.","TU resection, Neck dissection bilateral

The tumor begins in the middle of the epiglottis, extends to the left into the area of the vallecula, along the aryepiglottic fold to the left arytenoid cartilage. The tumor ends just above the left pouch ligament. In addition, the tumor reaches the lateral pharyngeal wall on the left via the pharyngoepiglottic fold.","Initial consultation with the anesthesiologist. Dissection of the tumor, histologically confirmed as squamous cell carcinoma, with the spreading laryngoscope. Cleavage of the epiglottis in the midline and dissection along the vallecula. Dissection of the pharyngoepiglottic fold and successive resection of the tumor, including the pharyngoepiglottic fold, the aryepiglottic fold and the pouch ligament. In addition, the tip of the arytenoid cartilage is also resected so that ultimately only the vocal process and the muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage remain. Careful dissection outside the tumor manifestation. Removal of the tumor in the area of the arytenoid cartilage and directly in the area of the pouch ligament on the left side. Resection of part of the right-sided epiglottis as a resection and finally obtaining numerous marginal samples. Intraoperatively, one has the impression of having resected healthy tissue. The marginal samples are found to be tumor-free. Extremely difficult preparation conditions due to the size of the tumor. Several intraoperative consultations with the anaesthetist due to the localization of the tube and bleeding. Careful hemostasis. Advancement of the flexible endoscope into the stomach. Placement of a PEG after visualization of the diaphanoscopy in the usual manner. On reflection, the stomach and esophagus are unremarkable. Repositioning of the patient, initially for modified radical neck dissection on the right side. Apply local anesthesia along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Abjode and cover the surgical area. Skin incision starting in the area of the mastoid tip, along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle up to the clavicle. Cut through the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the auricularis magnus nerve. Displacement to the cranial side and at the end of the operation re-embedding of the same in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the external jugular vein, which is also preserved, relocated cranially and re-embedded at the end of the operation. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Displacement and re-embedding of the accessorius nerve at the end of the operation in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the common carotid artery, the internal and external carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, the vagus nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the posterior venter of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the parotid gland. Removal of lymphatic and connective tissue in the area of levels IV and V. Here, the fascia of the deep neck muscles is dissected, the cervical plexus is exposed, displaced accordingly and spared. Dissection in a caudal direction. Exposure of the scalene gap. Exposure of the brachial plexus and the phrenic nerve. These structures are also spared. Deposition of the specimen supraclavicularly. Careful hemostasis. Exposure of the facial vein. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the capsule of the submandibular gland. Removal of the lymphatic and connective tissue in the area of levels Ib, II and III. Intraoperatively, several smaller lymph nodes were found, but these were not suspicious for malignant infestation. Irrigation of the wound with water and hydrogen. Insertion of a redon drain. Wound closure in layers. Application of a pressure dressing. This results in a modified radical neck dissection of level Ib to V. The patient is then repositioned for neck dissection on the left side. A large level II, III metastatic mass extending into the caudal parotid gland is already visible. First mark the planned incision. Cut through the cutis and subcutis. Expose the platysma and cut it sharply. Expose the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissect it from caudal to cranial. Exposure of the omohydius muscle as the caudal border. From level III, an extensive, obviously capsule-overwriting metastatic comglomerate is visible, which extends into the subcutaneous level. The sternocleidomatoid muscle appears to be widely infiltrated here. Therefore, first mobilize the conglomerate and take a corresponding skin spindle in the area of the infiltration of the subcutaneous tissue. Insertion of the lower retractor. Turn to the jugular vascular sheath. Expose the internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery. Initial attempt to preserve the internal jugular vein. From level III, however, it becomes apparent that this is infiltrated over a large area by the metastatic conglomerate. Therefore, initially caudal dissection and double ligation as well as bypassing of the jugular vein stump. Dissect medially and cranially. Exposure of the digastric muscle. This also appears to be infiltrated by the tumor in the area of the posterior venter. The hypoglossal nerve located inferior to it also appears to be initially drawn into the metastasis. Extremely careful blunt dissection here. With great effort, it is finally possible to separate the nerve stump from the metastasis. The nerve is moved cranially in the sense of a neurolysis and can be spared during the operation. The facial vein and its branches must also be severed and ligated. Exposure of the carotid bifurcation and the internal and external carotid artery. Successive detachment of the metastatic conglomerate, which also infiltrates the caudal glandular pole of the parotid gland over a wide area. Parts of the oral branch must also be resected, as this is enveloped by the tumor infiltrate over a medium to long distance. In the meantime, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is also removed at the inferior margin. Cranially, the muscle is also detached at its point of attachment to the mastoid. The accessorius nerve can be separated from the metastatic conglomerate with difficulty. The metastatic conglomerate can be resected in toto after exposing, separating and legaturizing the cranial jugular part. The lateral neck preparation is then developed up to level V. The plexus branches are largely spared. At the end of the operation there is no evidence of chyle flow. Subsequent development of the medial neck preparation. Careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Dry wound conditions at the end of the operation. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redondra ring. Subcutaneous suture with Vicryl 4-0 and skin suture with Ethilon 5-0. Repositioning of the patient for tracheotomy. Initial palpatory identification of the ring button level. Marking of the same. Creation of the skin incision in the form of an inverted T approx. 2 cm below the level of the ring node. Sharp transection of the cutis and subcutis. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the linea alba. Incision in the area of the linea alba and blunt lateral dissection of the muscle bellies. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining of the same. Generous coagulation of the thyroid isthmus and insertion of the retractors. Subsequent identification of the button space between the second and third tracheal cartilage. Incision of the trachea and preparation of a wide-based styled Björk flap. Subsequent tension-free circular successive epithelialization of the tracheostoma. This was successful without any problems. Change to an 8-gauge high volume-low pressure cannula. At the end of the entire surgical procedure, another detailed discussion with the anesthesiologist in the sense of a final consultation and completion of the operation without complications.","Supraglottic laser resection, Neck dissection, PEG placement, Tracheotomy

Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery is now indicated.","First of all, after preparation by the anesthetist, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The tumor is confirmed, which is located in the area of the uvula and also in the area of the palatal arch on both sides up to the tonsil border and also extends to the posterior wall of the palatal arch. Therefore, the indication for surgery and flap coverage is now confirmed. The tracheostomy follows: a horizontal incision is made approx. 5 cm 2 QF above the jugulum, sharply cutting through the skin, subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. The prelaryngeal musculature and the infrahyoid musculature are exposed, entered in the midline and the thyroid gland is exposed. Dissection of the trachea between the cricoid cartilage and isthmus. The isthmus is bipolarly dissected. No major bleeding. Between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasp, the trachea is entered and a visual tracheotomy is created without a Björk flap. The patient is intubated with an 8-gauge cannula. Completion of the procedure without complications. Subsequent PEG insertion: Start with insertion of the PEG tube. After entering the stomach and postoperative diaphanoscopy, the tube is inserted under visualization. This is performed without any problems. Application of a wound dressing. The tumor is now removed macroscopically with a safety margin of at least 1 to 1 1/2 cm on all sides. The entire tumor is marked with sutures. In addition, marginal sample of the pharynx caudal right and posterior palatal arch left. In the frozen section, both the specimen and the margin samples are healthy and free of carcinoma. Careful hemostasis. Repositioning for neck dissection: Neck dissection on the right (<CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME>): Skin incision in a curved incision on the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle from the mastoid to caudal at the level of the omohyoid. Sharp transection of the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure of the external jugular vein and transection. Elevation of the subplatysmal flap. Exposure of the submandibular gland, accessorius nerve, internal jugular vein and omohyoid muscle. There is a large metastasis in level II on the right side with infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the lower branch of the accessorius nerve. After demonstrating the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the decision was made to perform a radical neck dissection and to resect the metastasis together with part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the lower branch of the accessory nerve. Dissection of the cervical vascular sheath is successful, the facial groove is also resected as it is drawn into the tumor. The neck specimen Ib to V is now removed, sparing the right cervical plexus. Two-layer wound closure with 4-0 Vicryl, platysma suture and skin suture with 5-0 Ethilon after placement of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Subsequent neck dissection on the left (<CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME>): Sharp dissection of the skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure of the external jugular vein, ligation and transection. Dissection of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, also here macroscopically palpation of several cervical metastases, these can be well dissected from the non-lymphatic structures. Thus, visualization of the omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland, accessory nerve, external carotid artery, internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein and removal of the neck preparation from level Ib to V. The left submandibular gland is also resected for the neck dissection. The digastric muscle is transected to enable the breakthrough. The superior thyroid artery is dissected and will later be used for the anastomosis. At this point, the patient is handed over to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who performs the flap incision. Then removal of the forearm flap and elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME> Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (11 x 5 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Covering of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. After suturing in the flap, the microvascular arterial anastomosis is performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME> in single-button sutures, whereby the radial artery is anastomosed to the superior artery on the left side. The venous anastomoses are performed using the Coupler technique by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. After performing the Coupler anastomosis of the veins, the ultrasound probe is placed to check the blood flow in the microvascular anastomosis. Then insertion of the flap: The submandibulectomy is performed first to create space for the tunnel on the left side in order to pull the stem of the flap through to the left side of the neck. For this purpose, submandibulectomy is performed in the typical manner, sparing the lingual nerve and hypoglossus. Subsequent transection of the digastric and styloid muscles with careful hemostasis. Creation of a 2-finger-wide tunnel above the residual tonsil on the left into the pharyngeal space. Then pull the stalk through after removing the flap. Cover the neck area moist. Suture the flap successively into the defect with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures with complete defect coverage without tension. Subsequent creation of the vascular anastomoses. The arteries are anastomosed between the superior thyroid artery and radial artery using <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The veins are then sutured. After condensation of the vessels, the larger cephalic vein is anastomosed with the outlet of the facial vein near the internal jugular vein using a 3.5 mm coupler. After opening the clamps, smear phenomenon positive. Then suture the confluent vein with the inferior thyroid vein, also at the exit from the internal jugular vein, using a 2.0 mm coupler. Positive smear phenomenon even after opening the clamps, good flow. Then attach a Doppler probe in the area of the anastomosis of the cephalic vein with the facial nerve. The Doppler probe is fixed in the direction of the internal jugular vein proximal to the anastomosis using 2 sutures in the area of the silicone ring. After placing Gelita under the venous anastomosis, good venous perfusion signals can be derived. The probe is later removed from the wound slightly caudally in the planned direction of traction. Subsequent irrigation of the entire wound area and careful hemostasis on final inspection - no further evidence of bleeding. Insertion of 2 flaps on the left and a Redon drainage on the right and layered wound closure, also with epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Insertion of an 8 mm tracheostomy tube. Enoral flap vital on closure, Doppler probe signal stable. The patient is ventilated with a tracheostomy tube and transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Please continue antibiotic treatment, which was started intraoperatively with Unacid, for one week. Feeding via the tube for approx. 10 days, then if necessary, depending on the situation, diet build-up. Monitor the flap clinically and also the Doppler signal for 5 days according to the scheme. Overall cT2-3 uvular carcinoma which was covered with radial flap. Intraoperative status at least cN2b, possibly also cN2c.

Panendoscopy and CT image morphology revealed an exophytic mass in the right piriform sinus. Histologically squamous cell carcinoma, therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","Induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. Intubation via the existing tracheostoma. First of all, entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the tumor. The tumor fills the entire right piriform sinus, grows onto the medial piriform sinus wall and reaches the arytenoid cartilage, growing around the arytenoid cartilage towards the postcricoid region. The endolarynx itself is free, including the left arytenoid cartilage. Insertion of a PEG tube in the usual manner, with very good diaphanoscopy. Injection of Ultracaine/suprarenin mixture and sterile washing and draping. Placement of an apron flap in the usual manner. Neck dissection on the right. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the cervical vascular sheath. Level II shows a very large metastasis, which is successively dissected out, sparing the external and internal jugular veins, the accessorius nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. These structures can be preserved, including the facial vein. During dissection, the jugular vein is torn twice and carefully sutured over with Ethilon. Remove the remaining neck tissue from level II to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Turn to the opposite side. Here also expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the cervical vascular sheath, the submandibular gland and evacuate levels IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Sparing of the external and internal jugular, hypoglossal and accessorius nerves and the facial vein. Release of the larynx on the left side. Dissection of the thyroid gland and the cervical vascular sheath. Ligation of the upper laryngeal bundle. Detachment of the infrahyal musculature. Release and removal of the hyoid bone. Turning to the opposite side. Here, only the upper part of the larynx is detached while detaching the infrahyal muscles. The rest is left in place due to the tumor infiltration. Release of the piriform sinus on the left side. No release of the piriform sinus on the right side due to tumor infiltration. Entering the pharynx while simultaneously pulling out the epiglottis. Incision of the mucosa, initially on the left side with opening of the pharynx. Inspection of the tumor under direct vision. Here you can clearly see that the tumor infiltrates the entire wall of the piriform sinus and also reaches the posterior arytenoid cartilage. The larynx is removed with appropriate removal of pharyngeal mucosa and placed caudally. Two marginal samples are taken from the postcricoid region and the lateral pharyngeal wall. No evidence of tumor or carcinoma in situ in the frozen section. Therefore R0 situation in the frozen section. Due to the very narrow remaining mucosa (well under 6 cm), the decision was made to lift a graft. Lifting of the supraclavicular island flap by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. For this purpose, a 9x5 cm skin island is cut around the upper arm and lifted, taking the muscle fascia with it. An auxiliary incision is made in the front below the clavicle and dissected in front of and behind the clavicle. The flap is lifted with a very wide handle and is well supplied with blood during the entire dissection. Form a skin bridge towards the pharynx. Pull through the graft and insert the graft into the pharynx. Insertion of the graft into the pharynx, starting at the esophageal entrance and moving cranially. This was successful without any problems. Of course, a Provox prosthesis was inserted in the usual manner prior to insertion. A myotomy was performed in the area of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides to create a flat tracheostoma. Insertion of two Redon drainage tubes in the shoulder area and also on each side of the neck. The tracheostoma must be partially revised. There is an extremely deep tracheostomy tube in the anterior section. Here it is not possible to suture the skin to the anterior wall of the trachea again. This is possible without any problems in the posterior section. Two-layer wound closure. Insertion of a tracheal cannula. IV antibiotics for 24 hours, X-ray pre-swallow on the 10th postoperative day.","Laryngectomy, Neck dissection, and Tracheotomy

Bone infiltration not detectable on imaging. Therefore indication for the above mentioned surgery. However, flap coverage likely due to the proximity to the bone. Therefore, the above surgery is now indicated.","Transfer of the patient to the operating theater. Introductory consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Carrying out the team time-out. Induction of intubation anesthesia by colleagues. Nasal intubation and fixation of the tube by the anesthesia colleagues. Start of the operation using hypopharyngo- and laryngoscopy. No abnormalities were found. The piriform sinus, postcricoid region and the entire larynx are unremarkable. Inspection of the base of the tongue without any abnormalities. Now insertion of the Jennings mouth retractor and inspection of the oropharynx. Here, an ulcerous mass is seen on the ascending mandibular branch extending to the tonsillar lobe and the glossotonsillar groove. The tumor continues to spread anteriorly along the mucosa of the alveolar ridge. Overall, the tumor extends to the first premolar of the mandible on the left. Upwards, the tumor merges slightly into the anterior palatal arch. The posterior palatal arch and the nasopharynx are free. In particular, no tumor spread along the uvula. Initially transoral tumor resection. The tumor is visible in the region described. This is successively resected macroscopically on all sides with a safety margin of 0.5 to 1 cm. The entire anterior palatal arch with tonsil, part of the base of the tongue and glossoalveolar groove, posterior part of the floor of the mouth and the entire mucosa in the alveolar ridge are resected dorsally. The remaining molar here is also extracted and fixed to the specimen for histological examination. The preparation is thread-marked. A marginal sample is taken from the area from the palatal arch to the alveolar ridge at the front as a lateral marginal sample and a further marginal sample from the posterior floor of the mouth. According to pathology, the tumor is relatively close to the upper superior margin and basally lateral. Therefore, again removal of marginal samples from the uvula and from the superior palatal arch, as well as extensive resection of the basal medial soft tissues, whereby the previously preserved lingual nerve is also resected, as it lies in the expected area of the tumor remnants. The entire periosteum of the mandible is also resected medially. There are no more tumor infiltrates in the entire specimen, so the resection is now R0. Extensive re-drilling of the medial alveolar ridge border and the alveoli follows. Subsequent irrigation with Ringer's solution with hydrogen and careful hemostasis. Swab insertion. Repositioning for neck dissection on the left: Here incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of V. facialis, V. jugularis externa, V. jugularis interna, V. thyroida media, A. carotis interna and externa. Exposure of the accessory nerve, hypoglossal nerve and vagus nerve. Subsequent evacuation level II to IV, caudal re-piercings or ligatures with clearly visible lymph vessels. Submandibulectomy afterwards. Removal of the submandibular gland without complications. Some adjacent lymph nodes are also removed. The digastric muscle is severed. A tunnel is then created enorally, which is now sufficient with 2 QF. The radial lobe is then elevated. To do this, measure the defect (5 x 8 cm). A parallel procedure is now performed by elevating the radial lobe using <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> and dissecting the neck on the left side using <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Elevation of the radial lobe. Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (6 x 5 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. For defect reconstruction on the forearm, full-thickness skin is harvested from the proximal forearm in the area of the S-shaped skin incision, thinned and sutured to the defect. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Subsequent insertion of the flap: insertion of the flap into the defect. Insertion of the stem through the created tunnel. Subsequent successive suturing of the flap, which measures 6-7 x 5 cm. All relevant areas are successfully covered, including the floor of the mouth and the transition to the base of the tongue. Complete coverage of the bone. Subsequent vascular anastomoses: A branch of the facial vein and the middle thyroid vein are exposed and prepared for venous anastomosis. The arterial anastomosis is created using the radial artery and superior thyroid artery using 8.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. Here the clamps are still open, good arterial flow and good venous return. A total of 2 branches of a suture in the confluence and one from the cephalic region are then prepared for the anastomosis. The anastomosis of the smaller outlet with the V. thyroidea media is performed using a 2.5 mm coupler. Good venous return after opening the clamp. Positive smear phenomenon. The larger outlet from the pedicle is then anastomosed with the outlet from the facial vein using a 4.0 mm coupler. Here too, venous flow is good after opening the clamps, smear phenomenon positive. Subsequent clipping of all remaining open vessel ends. Careful irrigation and hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a total of 2 flaps. Subsequent insertion of a gastric tube. A PEG was initially dispensed with. Then indication for tracheotomy due to significant swelling of the tongue. We waited until the end of the operation to carefully determine the indication for this procedure. There is now a clear swelling of the tongue, therefore tracheotomy by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. For this, incision of the skin just below the cricoid, sharp dissection in depth and ligation of the anterior jugular vein on the right side. Dissect the infralaryngeal musculature and reach the thyroid isthmus. This is undermined and bipolarized. Now reach the anterior wall of the trachea. Enter the trachea in the 2nd to 3rd intertracheal space. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma in the usual manner using 4 sutures and insertion of an 8-gauge tracheal cannula. Subsequent re-inspection of the flap enorally, which is well perfused. Completion of the procedure without complications. Postoperatively, the patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics, which were started intraoperatively with Unacid, for one week. Nutrition via gastric tube for approx. 7-10 days. Then build up the diet. Checking the vitality of the flap according to the scheme for 5 days. Overall T2 tumor at the alveolar ridge glossoalveolar junction and upper tonsil pole or lateral palatal arch area. cN0 situation in the neck area on both sides.

Injection, sterile washing and draping. The tumor is first inspected with the Kleinsasser tube. The tumor starts at the tonsil loge on the right side, moves caudally along the pharyngeal side wall, infiltrates the entire piriform sinus on the right side including the tip of the piriform sinus, spreads from the piriform sinus to the larynx and infiltrates the postcricoid region, pocket folds and vocal fold and also moves into the esophageal entrance via the piriform sinus. Start the operation by creating an apron flap in the usual way. Release of the larynx. Start at the hyoid bone on the left side. The hyoid bone cannot be completely detached on the right side, as the tumor is already infiltrating the hyoid bone and soft tissue on CT morphology, so half of the hyoid bone must be detached on the left side and the rest is left in situ. Release of the larynx initially on the left side. Detachment of the oblique laryngeal muscles. Removal of the piriform sinus and detachment of the thyroid gland. Also detachment of the thyroid gland on the right side. Detachment of the cervical vascular sheath from the pharynx and entry into the pharynx from the left side. Inspection of the tumor and resection of the tumor, including the lower pole of the tonsil and the entire pharyngeal wall on the right side. Removal of the larynx, including parts of the esophageal inlet. The tumor specimen is inserted en bloc into the frozen section. Macroscopically, there is a scarce resection in the area of the piriform sinus and the esophageal duct. Therefore, another resection is immediately performed here and a new marginal sample is taken. No dysplasia, no carcinoma in situ and no invasive carcinoma in the resected specimen or in the new marginal specimen. Final margin samples R0 on all sides. Inspection of the mucosa in the area of the caudal mucosal part and esophageal entrance, relatively little mucosa is present, as well as upwards towards the tonsil lobe. Intraoperative demonstration of the defect on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. A joint decision is made to insert a radialis graft. The defect is measured, 18 x 8 cm with a bulge at the tonsil lobe. This graft is lifted on the forearm by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Removal of the radialis flap. Removal of the radial graft on the right arm by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Measurement of the defect and removal of a 15 x 8 cm radialis graft from the right forearm. To do this, mark the graft and the radial artery and ulnar artery. Then angulation of the forearm and dissection without tourniquet. Cut around the graft and extend the incision to the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Exposure of the radial artery. Deposition and transposition of the radial artery after application of a vascular clamp for approx. 5 minutes. During this time, good oxygen saturation was measured on the index finger. Lift the graft from the tendons and dissect the pedicle in the usual manner up to the crook of the elbow. Dissection of the basilic vein and cephalic vein. Dissection of the venous confluence up to the deep venous system. Exposure of the interosseous artery and removal of the radial artery while preserving the interosseous artery. Removal of two superficial and two deep veins. Parallel to the harvesting, the split skin is removed from the thigh by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Now close the wound on the right forearm with the removed split skin using <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> in the usual way. Insertion of swabs and application of a dorsal forearm splint. In the meantime, the neck dissection is performed on both sides. Start on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein and the facial vein and release of the neck block II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the other side. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release the cervical vascular sheath and detach the neck preparation II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. The neck vessels are now prepared microscopically, initially on the left side. However, during preparation it becomes apparent that the vessels on the left side are not suitable for anastomosis, so the procedure is switched to the right side. Here the superior thyroid artery is prepared, the facial vein and an outlet from the facial vein and the external jugular vein. Then, after removing the radialis graft, the graft is flushed with heparin, which can be done without any problems, and then the anastomosis of the artery and the two veins is started in the usual way. Suturing of the graft initially in the area of the oropharynx. The graft was configured in such a way that the tonsil lobe was given an extra bulge in the graft, and suturing began there. Then successive suturing caudally. In the area of the esophageal opening, a V-shaped esophageal opening plasty must be performed. To do this, a myotomy is performed on the dorsolateral side on the left and a slightly paramedian incision is made in the esophageal entrance on the right to create a V-shaped defect. The radial flap is inserted into this V-shaped defect like a jigsaw puzzle. Several sutures are placed and the graft is fixed in place with inverting sutures. Finally, the graft is completely sutured into place. A monitor was not used as the graft is too large to shorten the stalk any further and the flap can also be easily checked in the tonsil lodge by direct inspection. At the end, insertion of a Redon drain on the left side and a flap on the right side. Fold back the apron flap. Incision of the tracheostoma and two-layer wound closure. At the end, control Doppler sonography in the area of the flap stalk. Good Doppler signal and marking of the flap pedicle. The patient goes to the intensive care unit ventilated. Please carry out post-operative flap checks according to the usual schedule. Continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours, preferably longer. X-ray emulsion at the earliest on the 12th postoperative day. Please consult the surgeon beforehand.  ","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation transnasally by the anesthesia colleagues. Sterile washing and draping. Now entering with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the tumor. As described above, the tumor is located at the base of the tongue on the right side with transition to the left side and is very large in size and CT morphologically also infiltrates the inner muscles of the tongue and infiltrates the hyoid bone. Then looping of the tongue and insertion of a covered retractor. Pre-luxation of the tongue in this way and also with the Kleinsasser tube it is not possible to expose the tumor transorally. It is therefore decided to perform the complete tumor resection transcervically. For this purpose, an apron flap is created in the usual manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. A lymph node was removed externally in level II. Massive scarring down to the accessorius nerve and the internal jugular vein. The accessory nerve has completely disappeared in a scar block, the internal jugular vein, the accessory nerve and the hypoglossal nerve can only be separated from the scar block with great effort. This also results in tearing of the facial vein, which is also located in the scar block area and must be ligated and removed. Now remove the neck block IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. There are several suspicious lymph nodes in levels IIa and b and also macroscopically suspicious lymph nodes in the other regions III and IV; all levels are sent individually to the pathology department. Neck dissection left <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Locate the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and expose it. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle to the cranial side of the digaster muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Locate the gl. submandibularis and expose the gland. Fold up the gland and expose the digaster muscle. Locate the VJI and dissect the large anterior jugular vein. Dissect the JVJ from cranial to caudal. The outlet to the facial vein is bypassed. Locate and preserve the hypoglossal nerve. Removal of the medial neck preparation. Now dissect the lateral neck preparation and remove it while sparing the plexus branches. Finally, a supraclavicular lymph node is successively dissected out. No increased bleeding, no chyle. Now measurement of the defect 12 x 6 x 5 cm. In the meantime, marginal samples were taken from the specimen itself and sent to the pathology department. All margin samples on the specimen were R0, therefore no resection necessary. The graft is now marked on the forearm and the skin incision is made. Then visualization of the vein situation in the crook of the elbow. Visualization of the venous confluence. Visualization of the brachialis muscle, visualization of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Exposure of the radial artery. Now take over the graft elevation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Detachment of the graft from the vein bed. Exposure of the pedicle in the usual manner. Outlets are clipped. Then take over <CLINICIAN_NAME> again and place the graft in the crook of the elbow. Two superficial veins and one deep vein are lifted. The graft is then sutured into the defect. This is somewhat difficult as the defect extends into the oral cavity area in the floor of the mouth and ends at the vallecula. In the end, the graft is sutured in completely. The vessels are then exposed on the right side. Here the superior thyroid artery is used as the connecting vessel and 2 outlets from the internal jugular vein in the distal area. All vessels are anastomosed. The veins are couplerized. There is good graft perfusion. At the end, the tracheotomy is performed and the apron flap is sutured in place. Before this, 2 Redon drains were inserted. The procedure is completed without complications. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Regular flap control according to the usual schedule and presentation of the patient at the tumor conference after final histology to plan adjuvant radiochemotherapy. The patient has already verbally agreed to adjuvant radiochemotherapy in advance.","Resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), PEG placement, Tracheotomy, Panendoscopy

Therefore indication for the above-mentioned operation. Due to the patient's express refusal to have a PEG tube inserted, a nasogastric feeding tube was placed.","Pharyngoscopy is performed first: A rather superficial, exulcerated mass is seen, which completely occupies the anterior palatal arch and widens slightly towards the soft palate. It then spreads a few mm over the tonsillar lobe and the glossotonsillar groove to the base of the tongue and towards the posterior border of the tongue. The posterior palatal arch is also partially affected and laterally the tumor extends almost to the retromolar region. The tumor is now resected with the electric needle at a distance of approx. 1 cm so that the anterior palatal arch is completely resected and the anterior side of the posterior palatal floor is also resected at the mucosal level. The uvula and the posterior side of the posterior palatal arch can be left in place. Laterally, the resection extends to the retromolar region. In the deep region, both the constrictor pharyngis muscle and part of the palatal musculature can be preserved. For this reason, good swallowing function is expected here after demonstration of the findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and reconstruction is dispensed with. Further caudally, the resection now includes the posterior part of the floor of the mouth and the edge of the tongue and then the resection is connected to the lateral oropharynx via the base of the tongue. Care is taken to ensure that sufficient distance to the tumor is maintained in the area of the deep tonsil lobe. Intermediate hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. An arterial vessel is stitched with 3.0 Vicryl RB1 suture. At the end, flushing with hydrogen and Ringer and renewed hemostasis. The frozen section examination reveals suspected mild dysplasia at the cranial edge of the palatal arch and CIS in the area of the anterior edge of the tongue. For this reason, a larger resection in the area of the tongue margin and a smaller, relatively superficial marginal resection in the area of the palatal floor are removed. Both are sent for frozen section diagnostics and are found to be free of tumor and dysplasia. This results in an R0 resection of a cT2 cN0 oropharyngeal carcinoma of the tonsillar lobe, the palatal arches and the base of the tongue. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit tracheotomized for monitoring and is to receive a further 3 days of antibiotics. The tracheostomy should be removed one week postoperatively after the swallowing attempt. The patient should not be fed transorally for one week. <CLINICIAN_NAME> - Neck dissection on both sides: repositioning of the patient to perform a neck dissection on the right side. Creation of a curved incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma.

Exposure of the pharyngeal musculature. Push them to the side. Exposure of the thyroid gland. Exposure of the upper and lower margins of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining and, after careful bipolar coagulation, severing of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Creation of an incision between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasps. Adaptation of the cartilage braces to the skin in the sense of a visor tracheotomy. Skin suture. Saturation of the patient and intubation and insertion of a size 8 Rügheim cannula. Completion of the procedure without complications.","Transoral resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy

After an initial suspected diagnosis of peritonsillitis, a G2 differentiated squamous cell carcinoma was confirmed during a panendoscopy. CT scan showed an extension of a cT2 cN2c oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left side with an unclear mass in the left lower lobe.","First, perform the PEG insertion. For this purpose, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. Here, with good diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and placement of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. Now turn to pharyngoscopy and initially transoral tumor resection. The left tonsil is clearly thickened, bulging, with central endophytic changes and otherwise exophytic parts. On palpation, it is noticeable that the tumor infiltrates the entire left soft palate submucosally from the tonsillar lobe, reaches hard to the hard palate border, extends to parauvular. Clearly infiltrates the posterior palatal arch. Here too, firm adherence to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Also submucosal growth through the soft palate towards the nasopharynx. Here, palpation and inspection reveal a free tubal bulge. The glossotonsillar groove is slightly raised but not infiltrated. The tumor is also adjacent to the alveolar ridge. Overall, absolutely immobile, almost completely submucosal tumor growth. The tumor is now resected using an electric needle and a dissection technique, subtotal resection of the soft palate to the right side, clearly parauvular. Resection up to the hard palate at the alveolar process, clear adherence in the area of the hard palate, therefore a small piece of bone is chiseled off here, but no signs of infiltration. Now resection of the soft palate. Overview of the growth towards the posterior pharyngeal wall and nasopharynx. Tumor growth to below the tubal bulge. Submucosal. Now resection to the buccal side and onto the alveolar ridge. Exposure of the ascending mandibular branch. Here also clear adherence but no infiltration, sharp incision of the periosteum here and pushing off with the raspatory. No evidence of osseous tumor infiltration here, visualization of the medial pterygoid, a clear displacement layer is now visible here, clearly no infiltration of the muscle, tumor can now be completely detached here. Resection cranially to below the tubal bulge, dorsally the resection extends to approximately the middle of the posterior pharyngeal wall, here at least 1 to 1.5 cm safety margin on all sides in the mucosal area. Preservation of the prevertebral fascia. Inclusion of a circumscribed tongue cuff with inclusion of the glossotonsillar groove, here a small tumor extension is visible towards the posterior floor of the mouth, this is also resected. Resection up to the submandibular gland. Due to the tight conditions here and in the area of the lateral pharyngeal wall with a palpable styloid process in clear proximity to the tumor, the decision was made to proceed further transcervically to secure the vessels. Taking marginal samples in the area of the entire soft palate and buccally. Also take a marginal sample in the direction of the nasopharynx. All marginal samples are tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Therefore, repositioning for transcervical tumor resection. First perform the neck dissection on the left side. To do this, make a skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and the auricularis magnus nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. A macroscopically clearly enlarged lymph node measuring approx. 1 x 2 cm can be seen at the posterior edge of the gland. Exposure of the entire length of the digastric muscle. Identification of the accessorius nerve. Now remove the anterior neck preparation, carefully preserving the cervical artery, the superior thyroid artery, the facial vein and the hypoglossal nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Here, conspicuous lymph nodes at the transition from level III to IV. Dissection of the vein, removal of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Evacuation of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Minutious hemostasis. Caudal no evidence of lymphatic leakage. En bloc removal of the neck dissectate. Now turn to level Ib subcapsular excision of the gland, removal of the nodes in level Ib with careful protection. After visualization of the ramus marginalis mandibulae, removal of the nodes with gland. Now complete exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, resection of the digastric muscle, pharyngotomy is also performed by resecting the gland. Exposure of the carotid artery with the exit of the superior thyroid artery, the facial artery and the lingual artery. A branch of the facial artery and the lingual artery must be cut off. Laborious preservation of the facial artery. After exposing the carotid artery, expose the styloid process. Now a good overview of further tumor growth. In the case of tumor cones towards the floor of the mouth, the gland and the submandibular tissue as well as parts of the mylohyoid muscle are involved. Significant basal resection. This creates a wide safety margin in the cervical direction. After securing the vessels, the tumor can now be easily removed in the area of the pharyngeal side wall. After macroscopic examination of the tumor specimen, the macroscopic examination of the specimen in the area of the floor of the mouth revealed a scarce situation, but a tumor surrounded by a soft tissue margin. A pharyngotomy was carried out here for further resection. Also a close resection. Here non in sano resection in the area of the cranial oropharyngeal posterior wall or towards the nasopharynx. Due to the tumor progression shown on the entire specimen, generous resection in the area of the cranial oropharyngeal side wall and towards the nasopharynx. Otherwise, macroscopically clear in sano resection on all sides of the specimen with almost completely submucosal tumor growth as described above. The frozen section diagnosis now confirms the macroscopic assessment of a circumscribed basal scarce R0 situation in the area of the cranial oropharynx. Tumor margin forming here, but with free resectate. In addition, a very narrow basal resection margin is seen parauvularly, otherwise confirmation of the R0 resection. A generous resection of the entire soft palate is now performed transorally, resulting in total resection of the soft palate up to the right-sided tonsil lobe. This is diagnosed as completely tumor-free in the frozen section diagnosis. After exposing the defect, which now extends around the entire soft palate to the buccal, posterior floor of the mouth, tongue edge and oropharyngeal side wall, a transplant measuring approx. 11 x 6 cm in total is measured and adapted to the soft palate situation. In parallel, the radialis graft is lifted from the right and the neck dissection and the sonographically described intraparotid mass are performed. Intraoperative discussion of findings and sonography with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First carry out the neck dissection. To do this, make an incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, extending it preauricularly, and cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Cut through the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and the auricularis magnus nerve, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Identification of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the cervical sinus, the hypoglossal nerve and the facial vein. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and clearing of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches, overall significantly more difficult preparation conditions due to the simultaneous surgical procedure. Now placement of a parotid lobule anteriorly. Preservation of the auricular nerve, a well-defined lesion can now be palpated at the caudal pole of the gland. Superficial and caudal location, therefore decision to perform extracapsular dissection. Resection of the mass with surrounding glandular mantle in toto, macroscopically most likely corresponding to a cystadenolymphoma independent of the tumor. The facial nerve can be stimulated in depth without any problems. However, there is no exposure of nerve branches at any point. Careful wound inspection. Meticulous hemostasis and, after wound inspection and irrigation, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Now turn to lifting the radialis graft. After marking the graft, apply the tourniquet. Cut around the double-bellied graft. Exposure and entrainment of the cephalic vein. Exposure of the superficial radial ramus. Strict subfacial dissection. Exposure of the peripheral vascular pedicle after peripheral removal of the cephalic vein. Separation of the radial vascular pedicle after ligation. Careful subfacial dissection. Meticulous protection of the vascular pedicle. Lifting of the graft using a small muscle cup in the area of the vascular pedicle with adherence up to the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the vascular situation. Exposure of the emergence of the anterior interosseous artery, exposure and securing of the ulnar artery, which is very strong. Exposure of a strong venous vascular bridge between the deep radial venous system and the superficial subcutaneous venous system. Reliable and safe elevation of the cephalic vein is therefore possible. Dissection of the vein up to the crook of the elbow. Isolate a double-headed venous vascular pedicle here. After careful clipping of all outgoing vessels, isolate the radial artery and the superficial venous outflow. Reopening of the tourniquet. Excellent hand and graft perfusion. Minutious hemostasis and, if flap vitality is excellent, removal of the graft after ligation. Preservation of the anterior interosseous artery. Now careful wound inspection, final hemostasis and careful two-layer wound closure and incorporation of the full-thickness skin graft from the groin. Finally, the wound is dressed with a vacuum dressing and a Cramer splint. Due to the good visibility of the graft, a monitor was not used in favor of the lifting defect in the arm area. Full-thickness skin graft from the groin. After marking a full-thickness skin graft measuring approx. 13 x 6 cm in a spindle shape. Cut through the skin and lift the graft strictly cutaneously. Final thinning with scissors. Careful subcutaneous mobilization on all sides and, after careful hemostasis, careful two-layer wound closure after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain with moderate tension ratios. In the meantime, as with the tumor resection, a tracheostomy was performed due to cuff insufficiency. For this purpose, the tracheostomy was performed approx. 1 cm below the cricoid cartilage and the skin and subcutaneous tissue were cut. Cut through the infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Subsequently, initially problem-free transfer to an LI tube. Then reintubation onto an 8-gauge cannula with inner core and suturing of the cannula. The radialis graft is now inserted. To do this, first place sutures in the area of the nasopharynx and in the area of the dorsal soft palate or the soft hard palate border and suture in the area of the right tonsil lobe. Pulling through the graft, suturing to the sutures provided. The graft can now be easily folded over to create a neo-soft palate. Good fit of the graft, reconstruction also in the area of the cheek and in the area of the alveolar ridge, suturing in the area of the tongue. With intact conditions on all sides, completion of the transcervical suture. Suture in the area of the tongue edge and the pharyngeal side wall. Finally, intact and tight conditions on all sides. Further transoral check of the suture. Here too, very good fit and, with intact conditions, now turning to microvascular anastomosis. Preparation of the pedicle vessels. Then preparation of the cervical vessels. This reveals a relatively weak superior thyroid artery, hence preparation of the facial artery, which is stronger but has a somewhat unfavorable course. Therefore, the artery is traced, the artery is removed after free dissection and beaten caudally. Despite a significantly stronger facial artery with a moderate caliber jump, the arterial anastomosis is now performed with 8.0 ethilon. This is extremely difficult due to the positioning of the vessels and the different vessel diameters. Successive adjustment of the vessel edges. After reopening the Acland clamp, immediate regular perfusion with immediate regular venous flow, tight arterial conditions, regular graft perfusion. Then prepare for venous anastomosis. To do this, remove the strong facial vein after ligation. Thrombosis is evident here, therefore clean the facial vein and shorten it back with now free conditions and regular venous bleeding. Performing the anastomosis with the Coupler 4.0, which is somewhat more difficult due to the vulnerable vessel wall of the facial vein. After performing the coupler anastomosis, there is a leak in the area of the venous anastomosis, which cannot be fixed with sutures. The venous anastomosis is therefore cut out with the coupler. Rerouting of the anastomosis also with Coupler 4.0. Now intact conditions and regular venous outflow. After reopening the artery, regular circulation and excellent perfusion of the graft. Final positioning of the vascular pedicle even with closure of the wound surfaces, no torsion. Therefore, after multiple wound inspections with good flap perfusion, insertion of a long rubber flap with caudal drainage and careful two-layer wound closure with residual cervical opening for hematoma prophylaxis caudally. Intraoperatively, the patient repeatedly experienced diffuse and increased bleeding tendencies, which could, however, be well controlled conservatively and surgically. The patient was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation. Conclusion: Extensive and highly aggressive cT3 cN2c G2 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left due to submucosal and infiltrative growth. Due to the intraoperative extension and the extensive submucosal growth, adjuvant radiochemotherapy is certainly urgently required here, also due to the interoperative R0 situation. Postoperatively, please monitor the flap meticulously by inspecting the pharynx. Postoperatively, a round gruel swallow should be performed on the 8th postoperative day. Depending on the swallowing function, decannulation can be performed promptly if necessary. Secondary findings: smooth and macroscopically rather benign mass of the right parotid gland.","TU resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Flap coverage (Radial), Extracapsular dissection of right parotid, Tracheotomy, PEG placement

After appropriate diaphanoscopy, the PEG can be placed and fixed in the usual way without any problems. Subsequent transition to tumor resection. After appropriate adjustment, the tongue is dislocated to the left and the tumor is resected with the monopolar caustic at an appropriate safety distance. The final examination reveals a tumor that has been removed from all sides in healthy tissue. Only laterally does the mucosa appear somewhat questionable. Therefore, another resection is performed laterally. Subsequently, circular margin sections are taken from the wound area, which are found to be R0 by frozen section histology. A complete R0 resection can therefore be assumed. The neck is then dissected on the left side. Here, regions I to V are completely removed while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. There is no clinical evidence of a suspicious cervical lymph node metastasis anywhere. Subsequent transition to the right side. Here too, the same procedure with the same findings. In addition, the predictable defect is created enorally during the submandibulectomy. Dissection of the tendons of the digastric muscle and skeletonization of the hypoglossal nerve. A large caliber facial vein is available for venous anastomosis, which is ligated accordingly. The facial artery is also suitable for anastomosis, as both the lingual artery and the superior thyroid artery are very small in caliber. A Redon and suction drain is then placed in the left side of the neck and the skin is closed in several layers. Removal of an 8.5 x 8 cm split-thickness skin graft from the left thigh. Sterile wound dressing. After removal of the radial flap graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, it is sutured into the mouth by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and the stalk is passed outwards into the neck. The patient is then handed over to <CLINICIAN_NAME> . Now lift the radialis graft on the left side. Marking of the graft, palpation of the radial artery and ulnar artery. Marking of the course and also marking of the cephalic vein, which unfortunately runs extremely far laterally and cannot be integrated into the graft. Then creation of the tourniquet and cutting around the graft and extension into the forearm as far as the elbow. Then expose the brachioradialis muscle, expose the venous star, expose the confluence, which is extremely small. Exposure of the superficial ramus, the radial nerve with 3 branches, all 3 branches can be preserved. Exposure of the radial artery with accompanying veins. Clamping and transection of the radial artery, then lifting of the radial flap from the tendon bed. Dissection of the pedicle up to the elbow and removal of the radial artery graft, taking 2 veins with it, a superficial vein and a deep vein including confluence. The arm is then covered in the usual way with split skin from the right thigh and a dorsal forearm splint is applied. The graft was sutured in place by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Then anastomosis of the radial artery with the facial artery and two veins to 2 branches of the facial vein. After connection of the flap, relatively heavy bleeding occurs from the flap vessel, which runs penetrating through the tunnel into the neck. The flap must then be detached again at the tip of the tongue. An open outlet can now be discovered in the area of the radial artery, which is clipped. This stops the bleeding. Refixation of the flap. Insertion of a Redon drainage (Jackson-Pratt) and two-layer wound closure. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient goes to the intensive care unit intubated and ventilated. Please continue antibiotics for 24 hours postoperatively, longer if necessary. Flap checks, Hb checks according to the usual schedule.","Right partial tongue resection, Selective neck dissection

This shows a deep infiltration, so that a hemiglossectomy is necessary with subsequent flap coverage.","First reclination of the head, opening of the mouth with a mouth retractor, tongue lashing. Remove the carcinoma with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm to 2 cm on all sides. For this purpose, resection of the left side of the tongue except for a small remnant at the tip of the tongue up to the midline, dorsally, caudally up to and including parts of the base of the tongue. To the side, resection of parts of the floor of the mouth. Partial resection of the lingual nerve and the sublingual gland as well as the wharton duct. Resection extends dorsally to the tonsil region. Preparation goes to the frozen section. Here, all margins are in the healthy area, thus R0 resection. Rearrangement for neck dissection on the left: First disinfect the skin. Injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. Start with the left side. Curved skin incision. Exposure of sternocleidomastoid muscle anterior margin. Dissection of fat lymph node package from the muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, internal/external carotid artery. Visualization of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Then develop the dorsal neck preparation while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Then develop the anterior neck preparation while exposing and preserving the superior thyroid artery and the lingual artery. Due to the resection of the wharton's duct, the submandibular gland with attached level b lymph nodes is also removed. In this case, the branch of the mouth is exposed in a short section. Finally, careful hemostasis. Irrigation of the wound area. This results in a neck dissection II-IV. Neck dissection on the right: Here the operation is performed as on the opposite side, but only level II and III evacuation with preservation of all structures as on the opposite side. Enlarged lymph nodes on both sides can be removed. Supraomohyoid neck dissection on the right due to cN0 status on ultrasound. Then measurement of the defect in the area of the tongue and floor of the mouth. Flap size resulted in 10 x 5.5 cm. The radial flap is then removed: mark the flap in the appropriate size. Apply the tourniquet after unwrapping the arm. Then cut around the flap subfascially from the ulnar side, later from the radial side. Incision curved towards the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the superficial venous system. This consists of several veins which open into the cephalic vein. This shows 2 ends. The brachioradialis muscle is then shown, with the pedicle below. Distal exposure of the radial artery. This is severed and supplied with prolene using 4-0 stitches. Distal also anti-shear suture on the flap. Successive lifting of the flap under its vascular pedicle. Outgoing vessels are clipped or bipolar coagulated. Dissection successively in the direction of the olecranon. The connection between the surface and deep venous system can be visualized and preserved. The radial artery is very thin-lumened overall, the connection to the brachial artery is very far cranial. Beforehand, the interosseous artery is severed and ligated. Very very thin radial vein, which is not suitable as an anastomosis. Very thick brachial and ulnar arteries. Finally releasing tourniquet. There is a good hyperperfusion phenomenon of the flap. However, blood flow starts with some delay, so the flap is initially left in situ to prevent reperfusion ischemia. In the meantime, the neck was dissected on the right side. The flap is now removed and the veins and artery ligated using a puncture ligature and clip. Two large connecting veins and the very small radial vein can be removed, as well as a relatively small radial artery. Now suture the flap into the defect: To do this, create a 2-3 QF wide tunnel from the oral cavity to the left cervical. To do this, cut the digastric muscle which is coagulated in a bipolar fashion. Then pull the pedicle through into the neck. Care is taken to ensure that it does not ..................................... The flap is successively worked into the defect without tension using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. The vessels are then conditioned. The superior thyroid artery, which has a similarly thick lumen as the radial artery, is treated first. The lingual artery is also dissected. First anastomosis of the radial artery with the superior thyroid artery after conditioning of the vessels. Suture with Ethilon 9-0 sutures. After opening the clamps, initially good perfusion with good venous return. In the course, however, insufficient perfusion and undescribed venous return. The anastomosis was therefore opened and checked. No thrombosis. Repeated suturing with Ethilon 9-0 sutures. Then open the clamp again. Here too, completely insufficient arterial flow and venous return. Doppler signals equally unconvincing. Clamping of the superior thyroid artery again and opening of the suture. No thrombosis recognizable here either. The decision was made to use the prepared lingual artery, which had to be severed anyway, as a bleeding prophylaxis for the anastomosis. The lingual artery is placed in a high position here and ligated cranially. The lingual artery is now conditioned and sutured to the newly conditioned radial artery, whereby the radial artery must be cut open narrowly due to the differences in lumen. Suture with 9-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, strong arterial flow and good venous return are restored. The facial vein and the larger part of the cephalic vein are now conditioned. After conditioning and measuring the vessels, a size 3 coupler is selected. This is used in the typical manner. The vessels are stretched over the silicone pins. After the coupler is closed, however, the pin gets between the silicone rings and the metal pin is pressed into the vessel. The vessels are conditioned again and the coupler is reinserted in the same way as size 3. The coupler is finally successfully placed by applying pressure from the outside to the .......................... After opening the clamps, good venous flow, positive smear phenomenon. Another coupler anastomosis is performed with a larger vein, which is also in contact with the internal jugular vein. Coupler size also 3.0. Here too, pressure must be applied to the coupler externally to prevent the bolt from drifting through the silicone rings. Good venous return here too, positive smear phenomenon. Subsequent careful irrigation and hemostasis. Final view shows good arterial perfusion and venous return, flap vital and well perfused. Wound closure in layers on both sides of the neck and insertion of a Redon drain in each case. Anastomosis region marked externally using suture. The forearm is closed using skin removed from the right side of the groin: First mark the 10 x 6 cm groin skin. Remove the skin as a full-thickness skin graft. After mobilization of the skin edges and careful hemostasis, layered wound closure of the fatty skin and also the groin skin using 3-0 Vicryl, 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Ethilon back-stitch sutures with insertion of a Redon drainage. Finally, sterile dressing. Then incorporation of the full-thickness skin into the defect. The wound is closed cranially in a typical layered manner. Then apply a hydrogel Mepilex dressing. Compresses are loosely applied over this. The hand is then fixed to a Cramer splint using an elastic bandage. Finally, tracheotomy: small Kocher collar incision due to the severe swelling with the tongue protruding from the mouth area. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. After spreading these, the thyroid isthmus is exposed. This is passed underneath, severed after clamping and treated with puncture ligatures. The trachea is then exposed. A free-stemmed Björk flap is created in the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Epithelialization of this. Subsequent insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. Re-intubation. Tracheal cannula is fixed with sutures. ......................plast dressing on puncture sites. Redon, otherwise no dressing and no cannula tape. Check the flap again enorally, it is vital. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue the antibiotic treatment started intraoperatively for 2-3 days. Also continue the heparin perfusor therapy started intraoperatively with 500 E/h for a total of 5 days. Regular checks of the flap or Doppler sono checks according to the schedule. PEG placement was attempted intraoperatively, but this measure was not possible in the absence of diaphanoscopy. A gastric tube was therefore inserted intraoperatively. The patient was to be fed via this gastric tube for 7-10 days. In the event of swallowing problems, a PEG tube must be inserted secondarily by colleagues in internal medicine or surgery. Total cT2 tongue margin carcinoma on the left, which was resected in sano and the defect was covered with a radial flap. Intraoperatively enlarged but not highly suspicious cervical lymph nodes on both sides.

Surgical treatment desired by the patient was discussed with the patient until flap coverage if required. CT shows tonsillar carcinoma on the left side in the wall area, which appears to be relatively well encapsulated.","Pharyngoscopy is now performed. Palpation of the tonsil tumor, which is mobile. Based on the palpation findings and the CT findings, the decision is made to attempt a transoral resection. PEG placement: insertion of the flexible esophagoscope and advancement into the stomach. There, after creating a spontaneous diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm stomach wall tube without any problems or complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Now insertion of the McIvor spatula. The tumor is macroscopically incised on all sides at a distance of 1 to 1.5 cm, including deep resection of parts of the pharyngeal wall. Fat is partially visible, but relatively far cranially and towards the lower jaw. The posterior palatal arch can be completely preserved, the anterior palatal arch falls away, parts of the base of the tongue fall away, resection reaches just to the beginning of the hypopharynx. The specimen is removed in toto and marked with a suture. Caudally, a marginal sample of tongue base mucosa, tongue base soft tissue and soft tissue of the pharyngeal wall is taken, as the borders to the tumor appear somewhat narrow here. In the frozen section, the tumor also extends just to the caudal margins. In conjunction with the marginal specimen, however, this is an R0 situation. Therefore, no flap coverage is necessary if the wall is still intact. Transfer to neck dissection on both sides: First inject a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into the sides of the neck on both sides. Start with neck dissection on the left: curved, submandibular skin incision. Exposure of sternocleidomastoid muscle anterior border, exposure of omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein, internal/external carotid artery, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Successive development of the dorsal neck preparation. The larger, cystic lymph node metastasis is removed in a block with the other lymph nodes. Levels V b and V a are also removed while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. The lymph nodes are then removed from the anterior neck preparation or revision level I b. This also includes exposure of the submandibular gland and removal of the capsule. The facial vein is exposed and preserved, as are the superior thyroid artery and vein. This ultimately results in removal of level I b to V. This is followed by careful hemostasis. Irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain. Then neck dissection on the right side: here, as on the opposite side, the levels II to IV are evacuated in a typical manner with exposure of the corresponding structures, as on the opposite side. Finally, careful irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution and hemostasis. Wound closure in layers and insertion of a Redon drainage. Due to the relatively extensive defect and the involvement of the base of the tongue, the decision was made to perform a temporary protective tracheotomy. A small Kocher collar incision was made. Subsequent dissection through subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature. Spreading of these. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped off, severed and supplied by means of puncture ligatures. Subsequent exposure of the trachea. Between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage a small, broadly pedunculated Björk flap. This is epithelized in a typical manner. Finally, insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. The procedure was completed without complications. Thoracic inspection revealed no signs of bleeding at the end of the operation. Patient admitted to the intensive care unit for 1 night for monitoring. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube for 1 week, followed by gradual diet build-up. Presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference to discuss adjuvant therapy.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement

CT shows infiltration in the direction of the hyoid bone or thyroid cartilage in depth, therefore no laser resection. Tip of piriform sinus and esophageal entrance free. The preliminary examinations show the possibility of a radial lobe. Therefore, the above mentioned surgery is indicated.","First of all, another laryngoscopy and pharyngoscopy: The tumor in the area of the piriform sinus anterior wall, which is very difficult to adjust and evaluate, is revealed. This confirms the indication. The patient is transferred for neck dissection and tumor resection. First radical neck dissection on the right: typical skin incision. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle anterior margin and dissection of the lymph node fat package. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. A large lymph node metastasis is visible. This can be dissected from the internal and external carotid artery, as well as from the vagus nerve. The accessorius nerve runs into the node, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is also infiltrated and the internal jugular vein. Therefore, ablation of the internal jugular vein caudally and cranially, resection of the accessory nerve and resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve and superior thyroid artery. Inclusion of the capsule of the submandibular gland and surrounding nodes from level Ib. This results in an overall removal of level Ib and II to V. Now tumor resection: Entry into the pharynx at the level of the hyoid bone. For this purpose, the hyoid bone is first skeletonized and resected laterally over an area of 2/3 of the right half. The resection extends downwards to the tip of the piriform sinus. The aryepiglottic fold and parts of the postcricoid mucosa are resected medially. The tumor is thread-marked. A marginal sample is also taken from the cranial side and also sent to the frozen section marked with a thread. In the caudal frozen section, there is still carcinoma in situ in the margin. Therefore, another resection of a wide mucosal strip from the area from the arytenoid fold to the posterior wall of the hypopharynx is performed in this area. This is followed by another corresponding margin sample. This goes to the frozen section. No more tumor infiltrates here. Therefore, R0 resection can now be assumed. Now modified radical neck dissection on the left side: skin incision as on the opposite side. Exposure of fat lymph node package. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein and its preservation. Exposure of the internal and external carotid artery, superior thyroid artery, hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Development of the dorsal neck preparation while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. The anterior neck preparation is removed, taking the submandibular gland capsule with it. This results in a level II to V evacuation. Subsequent tracheostoma creation: small Kocher collar incision. This is done in the area of the old scar. Exposure through scar tissue up to the thyroid gland. Apparently previous resection on the left. Isthmus is cut again and pushed to the side. Trachea is opened in the 1st/2nd intercartilaginous space. Small, broadly pedicled, modified Björk flap. Epithelialization of this in a typical manner. Insertion of a laryngectomy tube. Then elevation of the forearm flap from the left side: marking of the flap in a size of 8 x 6 cm. Mark the skin monitor. Angulate the arm and apply the tourniquet. Cut around the flap, initially close to the ulnar side. Here also expose the ulnar artery, then also radially. On the radial side, include the cephalic vein, which is contained in the subcutaneous tissue to the skin monitor. The radial artery is placed caudally and supplied with puncture ligatures. The flap is lifted subfascially with the pedicle in a typical manner. Small outgoing vessels are clipped. Connection of superficial/deep venous system in the elbow. Exposure of the outlet of the interosseous artery as well as the confluence and 2nd vein outlet. Deposition of the flap in the area of the cephalic vein, confluence and in front of the outlet of the interosseous artery. The artery is supplied with puncture ligatures. Flap vessels are flushed with heparin. A piece of full-thickness skin of the appropriate size is removed from the groin. After mobilizing the skin, the groin is closed in layers in a typical low-tension manner with the insertion of a Redon drain. Full-thickness skin is sutured into the defect in the forearm area and the forearm area is closed in layers in a cranial direction. A Vacuseal dressing and a stretcher splint are then applied. Suturing of the flap: The flap is sutured into the defect without tension using 3/0 Vicryl in single button sutures after sutures have been placed using the appropriate technique. The sutures are conditioned in each case. The superior thyroid artery is sutured to the radial artery using 8/0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good flow and good venous re-flow. The cephalic vein is connected to the external jugular vein with a 3/0 coupler after measuring. The medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve is connected to the superior laryngeal nerve with Ethilon 9/0 single button sutures to sensitize the flap. This is carried out after the nerve endings have been freshened. Final inspection shows good skin perfusion, good arterial flow, good venous return. The right side of the neck is closed by inserting the skin monitor. A Redon drain is also inserted here, which is secured with a suture. After irrigation, the left side of the neck is closed in layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. Laryngectomy tube is replaced by a cannula with a core, which is secured with sutures. The procedure is completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Heparin perfusor started intraoperatively at 500 units per hour should be continued for 5 days. Antibiotics started preoperatively should be continued for 1 week. Postoperative feeding of the patient via PEG tube. Build up diet after swallowing porridge, from the 10th postoperative day at the earliest. Please check the flap postoperatively according to the schedule using Doppler and checking the skin monitor.  ","Resection and Neck dissection

In 1983 and 1986 a new radiotherapy with neck dissection was performed on both sides. The patient received a total of over 100 Gy. A second carcinoma now appeared in the area of the oropharynx, starting at the glossoalveolar groove, extending into the base of the tongue and the posterior palatal arch. The external biopsy revealed a G2 squamous cell carcinoma. Clinically, there is a cN2 neck status. In addition, the patient has a complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery on the left side and multiple plaques of the external carotid artery on both sides. The patient underwent left carotid surgery <2015>. Due to the rather superficially growing tumor and due to the previous vascular disease, only the above-mentioned tumor resection was performed and a neck revision was dispensed with and, if possible, a free flap graft was also dispensed with.","First induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthetist. Position the patient and enter with the flexible esophagoscope and inspect the esophagus and stomach. No abnormalities here. Perform panendoscopy with the small bore tube. A conspicuous area of mucosa can be seen on the upper edge of the epiglottis on the right side and also in the vallecula on the left side. These are biopsied and sent for frozen section. Mild to moderate dysplasia is found on both sides. Insertion of the spandex and looping of the tongue. Inspection of the tumor region: There is an exophytic mass at the glossoalveolar fold with transition to the base of the tongue and the soft palate. Incision of the mucosa with the monopolar needle. Start with resection in the area of the soft palate. The back surface of the soft palate with mucosa can still be preserved here. The tumor grows very extensively at this point. Further tumor resection in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, the posterior palatal arch and the base of the tongue. The tumor can be easily lifted away from the alveolar ridge so that there is no exposed bone. The entire tumor specimen is thread-marked for frozen section. A carcinoma in situ can only be seen in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, transition to the base of the tongue. A resection is taken here and another marginal sample is taken. Overall complete R0 resection. In the area of the pharyngeal side wall, some cervical fatty tissue is visible at one point. TachoSil is applied here and the pharyngeal muscles are sutured over to prevent a fistula from forming. Due to the large wound area and poor intubation of the patient, the decision was made to perform a tracheostomy. Skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection down to the musculature. Splitting of the muscles in the midline. Exposure of the thyroid gland. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Entering the trachea between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Suturing of the skin to the anterior wall of the trachea and insertion of an 8-gauge tracheal cannula. At the end, insertion of a nasogastric tube.

Resection using robot-assisted surgery therefore does not appear to be possible, so the tumor is repositioned using the Kleinsasser size B tube. The tumor can then be carefully resected with the small forceps and the small scissors under constant coagulation. Representative marginal samples are then taken, all of which are found to be tumor-free by the pathologists during the operation. After further subtle hemostasis, the procedure is completed.

Left and right hypopharynx, piriform sinus and postcricoid region macroscopically unremarkable. Now open the oral cavity with the mouth retractor. An exophytic tumor measuring approx. 2 x 3 cm can now be seen in the area of the edge of the tongue. After marking with the electron needle, an excision biopsy is performed at a safe distance from the tumor. The tumor is removed in toto and marginal samples are taken from the specimen in a clockwise direction. The tumor and the marginal samples should be sent to the pathology department for urgent histology. Minor bleeding is coagulated, major bleeding is stopped. The wound edges are then readapted to prevent bleeding. F a c i t : cT2 tongue margin carcinoma on the right, which was removed in toto by excisional biopsy.

A submucosally altered tumorous formation was found in the left tonsil region, extending superficially to the edge and base of the tongue. The caudal end of the tumor is difficult to adjust; in any case, it extends beyond the tonsillar lobe to the level of the upper edge of the epiglottis and the entrance to the piriform sinus. Adjustment of the larynx and the hypopharynx and piriform sinus on the right side and also the larynx on the left side as well as the posterior pharyngeal wall, posterior hypopharyngeal wall are free. Start with transoral tumor resection. It is marked with the monopolar needle on the anterior palatal arch and incised. Then further dissection with scissors so that a wide safety margin is created. The tonsil is completely removed together with the surrounding tissue, mucosa and muscles down to the base of the tongue. The tumor resection must then be interrupted as it is no longer clear and the patient is moved to the neck dissection on the left side. Start of neck dissection on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Locating the accessorius nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of levels II a, III, IV and V. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and digastric muscle. Dissection of the digastric muscle. Removal of the submandibular gland and pushing aside the stylohyoid muscle. Push aside and partially sever the muscles of the floor of the mouth. Then blunt entry into the oropharynx. This is successful without any problems. The tumor can be palpated and inspected. Enlargement of the pharyngostomy and further removal of the tumor via the transcervical approach. This is relatively difficult as the hypoglossal nerve runs to the tongue in this area, but must of course be preserved. With the help of <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the last remnant of the tumor is removed while preserving the hypoglossal nerve. The tumor specimen is thread-marked and sent for histological examination. It can be resected in a frozen section R0. Then complete the neck dissection on the left side and turn to the opposite side. Analogous procedure here. Expose the sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid, digastric and submandibular gland. Clearing of levels II to V a while sparing the plexus branches and exposing the cervical vascular sheath and free preparation of the internal jugular vein. The radialis graft is lifted at the same time. According to the previously performed measurements, an 11 x 8 cm graft is drawn on the left forearm, then the skin is incised. The brachioradialis muscle is exposed. The superficial ramus of the radial nerve is located and visualized, including its branches. Locate and visualize a large vein of the superficial venous system median to the forearm. Locate and expose the radial artery. Clamping and ligation of the radial artery. The pulse oximetry measurement indicates good blood flow to the hand via the ulnar artery. Dissection down to the tendon layer so that the paratendineum is just preserved. Lift the graft from the tendon layer. Then switch to the ulnar side and also develop the flap while preserving the paratendineum of the forearm tendons. Dissection of a long pedicle, preserving a superficial vein and at least one vein ................................................. of the radial artery. The branches are bipolarized and clipped. Dissection of the pedicle up to the crook of the elbow. Dissection of the venous plexus and removal of the specimen with removal of the radial artery and two large-lumen veins. The graft is then fitted into the defect. This is difficult due to the hypoglossal nerve. Incision of the graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who carefully sutures the graft first from the transcervical and then from the transoral or alternating sides. At the same time, the split skin on the right thigh is lifted. Unfortunately, this is also very difficult as there is a technical defect in the dermatome and the knife is also not sharp. Unfortunately, this results in a very large wound area, which is, however, adequately treated afterwards. The arm is closed parallel to the incision in the usual way. First, the upper part of the forearm is sutured in two layers. Then retaining sutures in the defect area. Application of the split skin, which had to be mixed in this case, and suturing of the split skin as well as a Mepilex wound dressing and application of a dorsal forearm splint. Then the anastomosis was applied. First, the arterial vessels are prepared in both the donor and recipient areas and then successively anastomosed using a vascular suture. Turning to the veins. These are also dissected in both the recipient and donor areas and then anastomosed using two couplers. The superior thyroid artery is used for the arterial limb. Then two-layer wound closure and creation of a tracheotomy. For this, skin incision in the usual manner. Dissection down to the infrahyoid musculature. Push aside the infrahyoid musculature and split in the midline. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Bipolar coagulation at the thyroid isthmus. Insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Re-intubation after creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis and completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is ventilated in the intensive care unit and should receive 500 units of heparin per hour for 5 days. Please monitor the flap and no oral food for one week. After this, an X-ray pre-swallow is performed and if there is no fistula, oral nutrition is possible. After receiving the histology, presentation of the patient in the tumor conference.","Tumor resection, Neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

Then insertion of the mouth retractor and inspection of the tumor region. An exophytic tumor is found on the right tonsil with transition to the anterior palatal arch. First mark the edges of the incision with the monopolar needle, then incise the mucosa on the anterior palatal arch with the monopolar needle. Continue the incision with the scissors and bipolar forceps, initially on the anterior palatal arch. Then release the tumor preparation at the upper pole. Then dissection at the base of the wound with spreading of the muscles and bipolar coagulation using the dissection technique. Release at the posterior palatal arch. Continue this dissection up to the lower tonsil pole, taking a small piece of the base of the tongue with you to ensure a safety margin. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation and insertion of hydrogen compresses. Suture marking of the tumor specimen and sending for frozen section. Unfortunately, carcinoma in situ with tumor infiltration is still found on the anterior palatal arch in the frozen section, so a resection is taken from there and a marginal sample is sent to the frozen section again. No more tumor infiltrates can be found in the frozen section. In addition, a marginal sample was taken at the base of the wound, as the resection there was probably very close in sano, to ensure that R0 was also present at this site. This was also confirmed by the pathologist. Ultimately, after frozen section, R0 resection. Transition to neck dissection. Skin incision in the usual manner at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Separation of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Finding and exposing the accessorius nerve. Then free dissection of the internal jugular vein. In the venous angle between the internal jugular vein and the facial nerve, a very large metastasis with spread to level II b is found, which is initially removed. Then removal of the entire level II b. There are further tumor-specific lymph nodes in level II b, all of which are systematically dissected out. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and removal of levels III, IV and V while sparing the plexus branches. Smaller lymph nodes are still present everywhere, but they do not look suspicious. Then evacuation of the upper neck block level II a and III while sparing the ansa, the superior thyroid and the hypoglossal nerve. Insertion of a Redon drain and two-layer wound closure.

CT shows that the malignancy appears to be growing into the left-sided base of the tongue and laterally towards the pharyngeal wall. Sonographically, there is a cN2b cervical lymph node status.","Tracheoscopy by the surgeon is extremely difficult in the case of a severely overhanging epiglottis, but can be performed on its own and shows unremarkable findings. Then intubation by the anesthesia colleagues and start with the flexible esophagoscopy: Advance into the stomach under continuous air insufflation. Now, after diaphanoscopy, insertion of the PEG tube in the usual manner without complications. No evidence of tumor or stenosis of the esophagus on retraction. Now insertion with the Kleinsasser D-tube in narrow conditions and inspection of the oropharynx. The previously described ulcerated mass of the left tonsil is seen, which spreads into the left base of the tongue in the area of the glossotonsillar groove. Palpatory findings are coarse here. The exophytic growth ends clearly in front of the uvula. Otherwise free hypopharynx and endolarynx, as far as visible also free. Esophageal entrance free. Now insert the tonsil plug and mark the resection margins. The tumor is first removed with the electric needle in the area of the palatal arch while preserving the uvula. To do this, the posterior palatal arch is cut through to the posterior pharyngeal wall. The tumor is now gradually cut around, partly electrically and partly cold, in the direction of the lateral pharyngeal wall. Now the tumor is cut around anteriorly in the base of the tongue and up to the middle of the tongue base so that the tumor becomes more mobile. The tumor can be easily removed both cranially and in the area of the base of the tongue; laterally, resection is more difficult. It is resected to such an extent that the submandibular gland is exposed and a larger vessel can be seen. In between, repeated bipolar coagulation and then removal of the tumor en bloc. The tumor is suture-marked as follows: Long/long suture corresponds to the lateral deep resection margin; ...... short/short to the base of the tongue at the caudal margin; short/long to the cranial margin in the area of the palatal arch. Extensive hemostasis is now performed and samples are taken from the margins as follows: Once from the lateral resection margin in the area of the submandibular gland, then in the area of the deep lateral base of the tongue and in the area of the left palatal arch. These samples are taken for final histological evaluation. Once again, extensive hemostasis is performed and a TachoSil sponge is placed on the vessel and the exposed gland. Unblocking and checking again after several minutes shows no renewed bleeding. Now transfer to tracheotomy: instillation of 4 ml xylocaine with adrenaline. Modified Kocher collar incision and visualization of the subcutaneous tissue, transection of the same and preparation of the trachea. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus and its removal after repositioning. Insertion into the trachea and, after placement of a Björk flap, placement of a plastic tracheostoma in the usual manner. Conclusion: Tumor was resected enorally as far as possible. If tumor remains laterally and this is proven in the histological tissue samples, further tumor resection from the outside with flap coverage is unavoidable. Otherwise, neck dissection should be planned on both sides in 14 days.","Enoral tumor resection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement, Panendoscopy

Therefore above mentioned surgery indicated.,"First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The exophytic tumor that was described can be seen starting laterally from the arytenoid fold and passing over the anterior piriform sinus wall onto the lateral piriform sinus wall. In addition, there is a flat, tumor-suspicious elevation, which has not been described before and is also tumor-suspicious. The decision was therefore made to cut around the entire area with a safety margin of at least 4-5 mm on all sides. Adjustment of the tumor with the spreading laryngoscope. Incision of the tumor with a distance of at least 0.5 to 1 cm on all sides. Resection extends laterally to the lateral wall up to the border of the posterior wall. It extends to the arytenoid fold, whereby the upper part is also resected, leaving the arytenoid cartilage free of mucosa. Resection extends over the most lateral part of the postcricoid region up to the vicinity of the tip of the piriform sinus. Cranially, parts of the vallecula and the base of the tongue are removed. Laterally, the pharyngeal wall is resected, but if the tumor is relatively flat, the musculature can be partially preserved. No fat prolapse at any point. The tumor is now marked with sutures. In the frozen section, in addition to the invasive carcinoma described, there is a second in situ carcinoma with a lateral margin. Thus indication for lateral resection. Once again, the tumor was positioned and an approx. 1 cm wide strip of mucosa was resected from the edge to the posterior wall via the lateral side wall to the vallecula area. Then take a marginal sample from the region described. This goes to the frozen section in 2 parts, lateral cranial belonging to the base of the tongue and lateral caudal belonging to the area of the posterior wall of the hypopharynx. No tumor infiltrates here. Thus now R0 situation. Now careful hemostasis. At one point, the musculature of the pharyngeal wall is slightly more severely damaged, but an outer part of the pharyngeal musculature remains in the direction of the large vessels. A tachosil fleece is placed here to secure it. No evidence of bleeding on final inspection. Due to the overall situation of the relatively large wound area with potential risk of bleeding and with regard to the removal of a protracted swallowing disorder, tracheostomy is now indicated. Repositioning of the patient. Injection of a total of 5 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline. Sterile draping. Small Kocher collar incision. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue into the infrahyoid musculature, which is split in the middle. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped off, severed and supplied with puncture ligatures. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Entering the 2nd intercartilaginous space. Creation of a wide pedicled Björk flap. This is epithelized in the typical manner. Finally, insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. At the end of the operation, the site is checked again and there is no evidence of bleeding. The procedure is completed without complications. The patient should be fed via the PEG tube for at least one week, then carefully build up the diet and initiate swallowing training if necessary. Discuss further procedure in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Laser resection, Tracheostomy creation

Therefore indication for the above mentioned operation.,"After induction of anesthesia, tracheoscopy is performed with 0° optics. Apart from the tumor described above, there are no other abnormalities. Now orotracheal intubation by the surgeon. Now proceed to microlaryngoscopy. This reveals an exophytic mass of the left vocal fold, which affects the anterior two thirds of the vocal folds and also reaches the vocal process; in addition, the mass infiltrates the anterior commissure and also extends approx. 5 to 6 mm into the subglottic outlet towards the subglottic. The finding <CLINICIAN_NAME> is now demonstrated, which still advises external surgery. Injection of 10 ml xylocaine with adrenaline in the anterior neck followed by a zigzag incision along the larynx. Dissection through subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature and spreading in the midline. Expose the thyroid cartilage, which is dissected from cranial to caudal and the cricoid cartilage is also exposed. Now cut the perichondrium paramedian to the right side and dissect out the perichondrium with the freer to the left. The thyroid cartilage is then dissected in the midline using the ............... Now open the larynx from the cranial side. The tumor described above is clearly visible and it can also be seen that the very anterior part of the right vocal fold is also affected, which is why the resection is also performed a few millimetres in the area of the right vocal fold. The larynx is then opened further and the incision is continued caudally to the cricothyroid membrane. The scalpel is now used to make the incision in the subglottic area of the left side. Then cut through the vocal fold directly in front of the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage and continue the incision in the area of the pocket fold, as the tumor is also growing into the morgue sinus. Then partially dissect the perichondrium of the inner side of the thyroid cartilage only in the anterior region in order to maintain a good distance from the tumor. The tumor is then resected along the paraglottic musculature. After complete resection of the tumor, meticulous hemostasis is performed. Six marginal samples are then taken: from the left vocal fold, the left vocal process, the left subglottic, the left wound bed, the right vocal fold and the right vocal fold - all are subsequently found to be tumor-free. After further consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, a tracheotomy was not performed. Now 4 drill holes are made with the Lindemann reamer and then, with the help of two 3-0 Ethilon sutures, the size 12 Keel is placed in the typical manner. Finally, the perichondrium from the left side is used to better close the supraglottic area of the larynx and then the cricothyroid membrane is readapted again using 3-0 Vicryl sutures. A flap is created, the prelaryngeal muscles are readapted and the wound is closed in two layers using 3-0 Vicryl and 5-0 Ethilon sutures, which can be removed after 1 week. The patient received intraoperative Sobelin, which can be continued for 5 days. In addition, a gastric tube is placed, which should also be left in place for 5 days. The patient's swallowing function should be checked before re-oralization.","Tracheoscopy, Microlaryngoscopy, Partial laryngeal resection

In summary of the panendoscopy, CT and sonography findings, the total extent was cT2c cN2c. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment with resection primarily from the outside was indicated with clear contact to the hyoid bone on computed tomography.","At the beginning, after induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, the first step was to enter with the small bore tube under dental protection after inspection of the inconspicuous oral vestibule. As described above, the exophytic, solid mass of the vallecula is now visible, slightly accentuated on the right. Circumscribed transition to the base of the tongue, which, however, is not further infiltrated by palpation and inspection. Tumor extension to the lingual epiglottis with clear infiltration or non-displacement of the tumor towards the epiglottis. Overall, the extension of a cT2 finding can be confirmed here. In conjunction with the CT imaging with contact to the hyoid, as already indicated, proceed transcervically. Position the patient for this. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. Submandibular skin incision with extension to the apron flap. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Dissection of the apron flap with high suture. Caudal dissection of the platysma. Dissection of both sides of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of both sides of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle on both sides and preservation of the facial vein. Exposure of the hyoid. Exposure of the infrahyoid muscles. Due to the cranial location of the tumor, the hyoid is skeletonized first, but the thyrohyoid connections and muscles are left completely intact. On the left side, above the hyoid, enter the pharynx. Perform the pharyngotomy approx. 1 cm lateral to the tumor and thus safely in sano. The tumor is now successively exposed. Resection with a small strip of the base of the tongue basally, especially on the right. The tumor extends in depth to the hyoid, but can be clearly separated from the hyoid with a good shifting layer. No signs of infiltration. Nevertheless, the periosteum of the hyoid is completely resected in the support area. If the lingual epiglottis is infiltrated, a subtotal partial resection of the epiglottis is performed. The petiolus and the caudal epiglottis can be left circumscribed. No migration through the epiglottis and no extension to supraglottic structures. Resection of the tumor macroscopically in toto. This is thread-marked for definitive histology. On macroscopic examination of the specimen, only a somewhat narrow margin in the area of the base of the tongue on the right is noticeable. A covering resection is performed here. Finally, the tumor is completely covered with marginal samples, which prove to be completely free of tumor and dysplasia in the frozen section diagnosis. After demonstrating the findings and discussing the case with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the adaptive, inverting mucosal suture is later applied to reduce the size of the defect. The hyoid suspension at the base of the tongue is then performed using Vicryl sutures of strength 0. This results in significant height gain and elevation of the entire larynx, which, thanks to the intact connection to the hyoid, can be well elevated by the measures described. Finally, completely intact conditions and stable elevation function. In the meantime, the neck was dissected on both sides, initially starting on the right side. After clearing out the anterior neck preparation, while preserving the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery and the hypoglossal nerve, the internal jugular vein is dissected free. This reveals several coarse and macroscopically highly suspicious nodules measuring up to 3 cm around the jugular-facial angle without signs of infiltration of the surrounding area. These can be completely removed macroscopically in sano. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Evacuation of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Careful inspection and, if the wound is dry, wound irrigation and turning to the opposite side. Now neck dissection on the left. The procedure is basically the same here. During careful inspection, nodules up to a size of 2 cm can be palpated in the area of the jugulo-facial angle. Also remove the anterior neck preparation while preserving the cervical artery, the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Subsequent evacuation of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches and caudal, special check for lymphatic dryness. Final irrigation of all wound areas and, in dry conditions, insertion of a 10 Redon drain on each side and careful, two-layer wound closure. Due to the resection defect and the a priori unclear swallowing function after subtotal epiglottis resection, a plastic tracheotomy is now performed. The tracheotomy is deliberately placed away from the resection area. Skin incision approx. 1 cm below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Entering the linea alba. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus and supply with re-stitching. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Placement of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Subsequent problem-free transfer to a size 8 low-cuff cannula, followed by repositioning of the patient and completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT2 cN2c G3 vallecula carcinoma right accentuated. Postoperative feeding via PEG tube for 7 days. Subsequent swallowing attempt and decannulation depending on swallowing function. Due to the localization and extent, with bilateral cervical lymph node metastases in particular, adjuvant therapy is urgently required here.","Transcervical tumor resection, Functional neck dissection bilateral, Tracheotomy

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was indicated.","After preparation and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, the patient is first positioned. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube under dental protection. The oral cavity is largely unremarkable. In the area of the right oropharynx, the right tonsil is clearly hyperplastic and irregular in a lateral comparison. Inspection reveals a clearly discontinuous growth. There are numerous perifocal carcinoma islands, especially in the direction of the posterior palatal arch to the posterior pharyngeal wall and clearly scattered beyond the caudal end of the tonsil region to the lateral pharyngeal wall. Now described as extending to the glossotonsillar groove, no tongue infiltration. Palpatorily no extensive deep growth. However, the area of the discontinuously growing tumor corresponds to the tumor extent cT3, palpatory right-sided conglomerate-like metastases, especially in level II, moderately displaceable. The PEG tube is inserted first. Insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. If diaphanoscopy is excellent, the stomach can be punctured without any problems. Subsequent placement of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. Subsequent preparation and repositioning for initial transoral tumor resection. Incision of the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1 to 1.5 cm, including the anterior soft palate and anterior palatal arch. Resection to parauvular level. Resection over the posterior palatal arch up to the middle of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Resection in depth, including the posterior palatal arch and the adjacent muscles. Inclusion of the glossotonsillar groove, resection up to the alveolar ridge mucosa. The transorally resected part of the tumor is now completely covered, including basally with margin samples. This shows an in sano resection for the invasive carcinoma, but longer residual Cis in the soft palate area. In the meantime, neck dissection of the right side and preparation for transcervical completion of the tumor resection had already been performed. For this purpose, a skin incision was made on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the auricularis magnus nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with careful preservation of the hypoglossal nerve, superior thyroid artery and the powerful facial vein. The conglomerate described above is now visible in the jugular-facial angle. The largest mass measures approximately 5 cm. Careful solution. There is no infiltration of the surrounding structure. Complete preservation of the structures is possible. Also preservation of the accessorius nerve. Complete the neck dissection with clearing of the accessorius triangle and level Va while carefully preserving the nerve and the cervical plexus parts. The external and internal carotid arteries are now completely exposed. Resection of the posterior digastric muscle, release of the submandibular gland with resection of level Ib and protection of the marginal mandibular ramus. The pharyngotomy is now performed via the tonsil lobe and additionally via the submandibular and connection of the pharyngeal openings and successive exposure of the tumor. Resection of the tumor in toto, also maintaining an adequate safety margin. The entire caudal tumor is now also imaged with marginal specimens. In addition, a generous resection is performed in the area of the soft palate, as is the renewed removal of margin samples. All marginal samples were found to be free of carcinoma and without evidence of higher-grade dysplasia, meaning that the overall situation is now R0. The defect was then measured and the decision was made to reconstruct the defect with the antero-lateral thigh graft due to the size of the defect, extensive pharyngeal resection extending into the vallecula and piriform sinus entrance. The neck dissection of the left side is performed first. To do this, make a skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Old auricularis magnus nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, facial vein, hypoglossal nerve and cervical vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve, clearing of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches without evidence of caudal lymph leakage. The wound is then carefully inspected. Wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. The tracheotomy is then performed due to the extensive defect. Horizontal skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Entering the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Subsequent problem-free transfer to a 9 mm low cuff cannula. The antero-lateral transfemoral graft is then removed. After marking the landmarks and doppler sonographic identification of the main perforator and 2 strong secondary perforators, the graft measuring up to 12 x 7 cm in total is marked with a special soft palate configuration. First medial incision, cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the fascia lata. Identification of the rectus femoris muscle. Strict subfascial dissection and identification of the S-stem. The anatomy is largely regular with a perforator branching off the ramus descendens and a circumscribed intramuscular perforator course. The relief incision is now made. Dissection of the vascular pedicle, complete resection of the graft. Removal of the fascial ata. Dissection and removal of the peripheral vascular pedicle. Subsequent elevation of the graft, leaving a small muscle cuff in the area of the outgoing perforator. Subsequent isolation onto the vascular pedicle. Exposure and entrainment of a slightly weaker accompanying vein and placement of the graft with regular blood flow after ligation. Then, if the wound is dry, adjust the wound edges and carefully close the wound in two layers after inserting a 10-gauge Redon drain. Subsequent application of the graft. This is done transorally and transcervically. Finally, good fit and intact conditions on all sides. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein. Performing the arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. This was successful and sufficient. Immediate regular venous return. Subsequent conditioning of the facial vein. Measuring a coupler size 4.0 and performing the venous anastomosis with the coupler system. Followed by regular .......pulsation. Positive spreading phenomenon. Excellent graft perfusion so that the stalk is then positioned. Then, with dry wound conditions, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Final inspection and completion of the procedure with a vital graft. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics for 24 hours. Conclusion: Intraoperatively R0 resected discontinuously growing right oropharyngeal carcinoma resembling cT3 cN2b. Defect reconstruction using ALT on the right. If the graft has healed properly and is intact, a diet can be started from the 8th postoperative day. Continuation of intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g for 24 hours. After receiving the definitive histology, presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference to plan the adjuvant therapy that will certainly be required.","Resection, Neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (ALT), Tracheostomy, PEG placement

No crossing of the midline. Caudally, the process extends to the entrance of the piriform sinus. This confirms the indication for surgery. Initial positioning of the head, insertion of tonsil retractor and retractor alternately. Start resection from the transoral side: cut around the process with a safety margin of 1.5 to 2 cm on all sides. Take the soft palate including the uvula with you. Resection extends beyond the lower jaw, mucosa is pushed away from the lower jaw. Pharyngeal muscles and thyroid muscles are resected in a lateral cranial direction. Resection extends to just in front of the tube. About 60 % of the base of the tongue is resected. Marginal samples are taken from the palatal arch to the beginning of the alveolar ridge, from the alveolar ridge to the floor of the mouth, from the floor of the mouth to the tongue and from the base of the tongue, as well as marginal samples from the medial pharyngeal wall or posterior wall of the palatal arch in the cranial region. The caudal view is too poor, therefore the resection is continued after the neck dissection on the right, which is dictated separately. Resection of the digastric muscle with removal of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the internal and external carotid arteries, the internal jugular vein and the cranial nerves. The glossopharyngeal nerve is resected distally. The lingual nerve is also resected towards the floor of the mouth. The pharyngeal wall is detached from all vessels, as is the hypoglossal nerve, which is preserved. The tumor is resected cranially and pushed caudally under the lower jaw with resection of the masticatory muscles attached to the lower jaw. Caudal resection under vision, whereby the resection is carried out below the caudal tumor borders to a length of 2 to 3 cm. Margin samples are taken cranial basal, medial basal and caudal basal. A marginal sample is also taken from the caudal part of the medial pharyngeal wall with the piriform sinus extending to the aryepiglottic fold. All marginal samples are thread-marked for frozen section. In the frozen section, marginal specimen in the caudial medial pharyngeal area, piriform sinus area and arytenoid area with in situ infiltrates. Therefore, a generous resection of an approx. 1 cm wide strip from the area of the caudal pharyngeal wall of the piriform sinus and the areas of the medial arytenoid fold up to the border of the postcricoid region. Another marginal sample from this area. Despite the extensive laryngeal resection, the marginal specimen still shows almost continuous in situ infiltrates in the piriform sinus and in the arytenoid region extending to the postcricoid region. Thus, given the distance from the main tumor, there is a suspicion of extensive growth in the direction of the piriform sinus and postcricoidal region. Due to the expected dysphagia with further resection in the direction of the postcricoid region in view of the flat growth, no further resection is performed. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: In preparation for transcervical tumor resection, the neck is first dissected on the left side. To do this, make a curved skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation while preserving the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve and the facial vein; a small, superficial branch is removed. There are now several conspicuous nodules in levels II a and III. No evidence of perinodal growth or infiltration of the surrounding structures. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Exposure and preservation of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Finally, no evidence of lymphatic leakage. Later, the external and internal carotid arteries are skeletonized to differentiate them from the enoral defect. Here, the lingual artery is exposed over a long distance. Subcapsular release of the submandibular gland is then performed. It can be seen that the cranial glandular cone is directly adjacent to the tumor. Therefore, this resection is performed together with the tumor resection. Removal of level I b. Several nodules up to 1.5 cm in size. The neck is now dissected on the right side. The procedure is basically the same. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Clearing out the anterior neck preparation while preserving the facial vein, superior thyroid artery and hypoglossal nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and completion of level V with careful preservation of the cervical plexus branches. In addition, the strong external jugular veins were spared on both sides. Careful irrigation of the wound. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Plastic tracheotomy is then performed. This involves a horizontal skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Dissection of the musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring and creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap. Subsequent problem-free insertion of a size 8 suture-fixed low-cuff cannula. At the same time, the radialis graft was lifted from the left forearm. After measuring the defect, a graft configured for the floor of the mouth, tongue, tonsil lobe and pharyngeal side wall was lifted, measuring up to 15 x 11 cm in total. After marking and placement of the tourniquet, the graft is recut and an arc-shaped relief incision is made in the direction of the antecubital fossa. Radial exposure and entrainment of the cephalic vein. Expose and secure the superficial radial nerve ramus. An oblique branch towards the palm must be removed, otherwise the main branch must be preserved. Expose the distal vascular pedicle. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Release of the distal vascular pedicle after ligation of the vessels. Ulnar preparation. Exposure of the flexor carpi ulnaris. Strictly subfascial graft release and dissection of the pedicle proximally with treatment of outgoing vessels. This shows sufficient confluence between the superficial and deep venous system, but clearly altered veins after puncture, so that the deep vessel is also included. After removal of the graft and careful hemostasis, the wound is carefully closed in two layers and the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the right groin is fitted. Finally, a good fit. Application of a vacuum sealing bandage and the Kramer splint in the functional position and repositioning of the arm. For full-thickness skin harvesting from the groin on the right. For this purpose, a graft measuring 20 x 8.5 cm is cut around an extensive graft, strictly cutaneous elevation. Extensive mobilization towards the abdomen and thigh fascia. Subsequently insertion of a 10 Redon drain in dry wound conditions and careful, multi-layered wound closure under moderate tension conditions. The graft is then inserted. This is considerably more difficult due to the extensive wound surface and exposed mandibular bone. However, the overall fit is good. Fitting of the graft with complete coverage of the resection area. Guide out the vascular pedicle cervically. Conditioning of the facial vein and the already prepared lingual artery. Perform the arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. This is successful and sufficient. Immediate venous return exclusively via the deep venous system, therefore, after measuring a size 3.5 coupler, problem-free venous anastomosis with the facial vein. Subsequently, if the graft circulation is normal, a 10 Redon drain is placed after multiple wound inspections and the wound is carefully closed in two layers. Subsequently, if the graft is vital and the patient is stable, the procedure is terminated at this point without any indication of complications. Conclusion: At least cT3 cN2b G2 rCIS-resected oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left. Defect reconstruction using a radialis graft. Please continue antibiotics for 24 hours postoperatively. If the graft heals properly, food can be restored on the 9th to 10th postoperative day with good swallowing function. .","TU resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage with radial flap, Tracheostomy

Placement of the McIVOR blade. Inspection of the oral cavity. This revealed a slightly hardened tonsil on the left side. The decision was made to perform a direct tumor tonsillectomy, including the anterior and posterior palatal arch. As part of the resection, a large safety margin is clearly maintained from the tonsil. Dissection from caudal to cranial, including fibers of the constrictor pharyngis medius muscle. The tonsil preparation is sent for intraoperative frozen section examination, which results in the diagnosis of a squamous cell carcinoma, forming a margin in the caudal area of the resectate. Therefore, resection in this region. Removal of three marginal samples (posterior palatal arch, anterior palatal arch, wound base) which were found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleagues. Thus, an R0 resection in the area of the left tonsil can be assumed. Subsequently, an esophagoscopy was performed. Advancement of the endoscope into the stomach. Inconspicuous conditions there.

In the preliminary findings, the tumor had grown significantly faster, therefore an urgent surgery was indicated. CT showed relatively flat extension, no infiltration of the mandible.","Enoral tumor resection dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Positioning of the patient for pharyngoscopy and transoral resection. During oral cavity inspection and pharyngoscopy, the tumor is seen in the area of the anterior palatal arch transition to the wire palate, through smaller extensions growth over the glossoalveolar groove to the cheek. Tumor also occupies the anterior palatal arch and tonsil region, growing forward to the floor of the mouth and the base of the tongue. Growth also towards the lower jaw. In the premolar region, growth also extends to the alveolar region, with marked thickening and suspected tumor infiltration. Transoral resection is now performed: insertion of mouth blocks. Application of a tongue tie suture. Exposure of the tumor. Incision of the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm to all macroscopically visible tumor margins. The anterior palatal arch and tonsil, tissue of the anterior palatal arch transition to the hard palate, which is exposed in bone. To the side, pterygoid muscles and buccal mucosa are removed. To the depth in the cranial region, removal of the deeper parts of the pterygoid muscles, removal of soft cheek parts up to the lower jaw, removal of the periosteum from the lower jaw. For better assessment, one remaining molar, one premolar and the canine must be extracted. When the periosteum is pushed over the alveolar space, tumor infiltration into the alveoli can be seen. The resection extends forward to the floor of the mouth, the lingual nerve cannot be preserved and is resected together with glandular tissue and muscle tissue. A small part of the base of the tongue is also resected. The specimen is marked in multiples and sent for frozen section histology. In addition, a marginal sample is taken from the front of the cheek via the alveolar ridge to the floor of the mouth at the edge of the tongue for frozen sectioning, also marked with sutures. In the frozen section, all tumor margins on the specimen are clear, except in the area of the transition from the alveolar ridge to the floor of the mouth, where there are small focal CIS infiltrates. Also tumor infiltrates in the soft tissues, in the floor of the mouth below the mucosa. A broad resection of the mucosa is therefore performed from the cheek area over the alveolar ridge in front to the floor of the mouth and extending to the edge of the tongue. In addition, a marginal sample is taken from the same area, which is thread-marked and sent to the frozen section. Also resection of the soft tissue at the floor of the mouth, removal of parts of the submandibular gland, floor of the mouth muscles, removal of the wharton duct, resection extends to the sublingual gland. Prior to this, further removal of soft tissue as a marginal sample, consisting of glandular tissue, muscles and periosteum on the lower jaw. Both marginal samples are now tumor-free, so that the resection of the tumor is healthy with regard to the soft tissue situation. In this case, the soft tissue situation is the same as the R0 situation. As part of the marginal sampling, a marginal sample was also taken from the alveolus in the premolar region, where areas of suspected tumor were found. Here, the tumor infiltrated the bone through the alveoli. Thus, a complete infiltration of the bone into the medulla can be assumed. To complete the tumor resection, a mandibular resection is required here, with replacement by fibula or scapula graft. Completion of the resection at this point. PEG placement and tracheotomy are performed, which is dictated by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. After enoral tumor resection, meticulous hemostasis. Subsequent insertion of the flexible gastroesophagoscope and easy advancement under air insufflation into the stomach. A clearly reddened esophagus with whitish mucosal deposits is already visible about 25 cm from the dentate line, with only sections of inconspicuous mucosa up to the cardia area. The gastroesophageal junction shows about 5 cm cranially extending, bleeding lesions of the folded ridges, reflux-associated DD Barrett's esophagus, DD (Winson's syndrome). In this case, a gastroenterological check-up with sampling is absolutely necessary in the further course. Air insufflation in the stomach, clearly positive diaphanoscopy and placement of a PEG tube using the thread pull-through method without any problems. The patient was then repositioned, abjoded and draped. Marking the incision for the tracheostomy. Cutaneous incision, subcutaneous preparation, longitudinal division of the linea alba. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus at its upper and lower edge, undermining of the same. Clamping of the isthmus on both sides. Sharp transection and repositioning of both isthmus edges. Incision between 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Application of a Björk flap inferiorly on both sides, fixation of the tracheostoma using 4 holding sutures cranially and caudally, a tension-reducing cutaneous suture on both sides and an additional lateral cutaneous suture on the left. Subsequent problem-free reintubation and ventilation via the cannula. The procedure was completed without complications. Please contact the oral surgery colleagues immediately to complete the operation and cover the defect with a periosteal graft. This should cover parts of the floor of the mouth and the bony structures in the upper jaw. It is not absolutely necessary to cover the area of the palatal arch, as the posterior palatal arch is preserved here. Aim for early transfer of the patient to the maxillofacial surgery department. Please continue the antibiotic treatment that was started intraoperatively with Unacid.","Resection, Tracheotomy, and PEG placement

After three attempts, PEG insertion is discontinued and a nasogastric tube is indicated. In the course of PEG insertion by the <CLINICIAN_NAME> or surgery plan. As there was no penetrating defect, the musculature was whole and aspiration was not to be expected, a tracheotomy was not performed and flap reconstruction was also not performed. Indication for neck dissection on both sides. Injection of 10 ml Ultracaine with added Suprarenin per side in the area of the planned skin incision. Sterile draping and abjoration. Positioning of the patient. Start with the left side: The skin incision is made along a curved line on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, two QF below the lower jaw, using a 15 mm scalpel. Sharp cutting of the skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma. The auricularis magnus nerve is exposed and spared. The external jugular vein is cut and ligated. Expose the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Lifting of the subplatysmal flap. Exposure of the submandibular gland, posterior venter of the digaster, accessorius nerve and omohyoid muscle with cervical vascular sheath. A relatively extensive metastasis measuring approx. 4 cm is seen on the accessorius, which is dissected off. There are several metastases below the accessorius, some of which have grown together with the digaster. Demonstration to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who is responsible for further dissection. The metastases are finally removed together with the posterior belly of the digastric muscle and levels I b, II, III, IV and V are resected. The accessorius nerve was heavily manipulated. Although it is macroscopically intact in its entirety, a loss of function of the nerve is to be expected, at least temporarily. Other branches of the cervical plexus are free. When the specimen was set down caudally in level V b, there was no leakage of chyle. Bipolar coagulation. To minimize the risk of secondary bleeding, the lingual artery on the left side is ligated by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Placement of a Redon drainage. Two-layer wound closure, 4-0 Vicryl and 5-0 Ethilon. Repositioning of the patient and turning to the right side: skin incision here in the same way. Sharp incision of the skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Expose the submandibularis after lifting the subplatysmal flap, the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle, posterior abdomen, accessorius nerve. Sonographic and palpatory cN0 neck status. The neck preparation level II to V is resected. There is no injury to the non-lymphatic structures, no chyle leakage. The accessory nerve remains intact. The hypoglossal nerve was exposed and spared as well as the common carotid artery, external/internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein. Punctual hemostasis. Creation of a Redon drainage. Two-layer wound closure using 4-0 Vicryl platysma suture and 5-0 Ethilon skin suture. Control of the enoral findings. No bleeding at all. The procedure was therefore completed. Conclusion: Enormous tumor resection of a cT1-2 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left side with the main mass in the area of the left tonsil. No flap reconstruction necessary. Due to the low risk of aspiration and post-operative bleeding, a tracheotomy is not performed. A nasogastric tube was placed if the attempt to place a PEG was unsuccessful.

After exclusion of suspicious primary areas on PET-CT, CUP panendoscopy revealed a differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in a blind biopsy in the area of the left base of the tongue which could not be detected macroscopically despite multiple panendoscopies. Hence the indication for resection. In addition, the postoperative sonography and questionable PET-CT showed 3 suspicious changes supraclavicularly, therefore indication for neck revision.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, positioning of the patient. First, a pharyngo-laryngoscopy is performed again. With the Kleinsasser tube, the oral cavity is inconspicuous, the tonsillolarynx is inconspicuous, the hypopharynx and endolarynx are inconspicuous and there are slightly hyperplastic conditions in the area of the right tongue base as described above; on the left side, inspection reveals a lesion measuring just under 1 cm at the transition from the tongue base to the pharyngeal side wall, which is somewhat contact vulnerable. Under microscopic examination, impression of a superficial ulceration. Adjustment of the lesions with the Steiner tube. Subsequent resection of the lesion with the 5 Watt CO2 laser in superpulse mode. Free conditions in depth with regular and intact musculature. Macroscopic resection in sano of the barely visible lesion. Absolute blood dryness. The resectate is now sent for frozen section diagnostics with the question of the blind biopsied primary. The invasive carcinoma is found to be tumor-free at all edges in the frozen section and thus resected R0. However, due to the non-oriented specimen, definitive representative margin samples are then taken. Careful hemostasis with absolutely dry and slim mucosa. Completion of the procedure. In the meantime, the left neck revision was performed. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline at the caudal end of the scar with extension into the supraclavicular direction. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the internal jugular vein. Separate the sternal muscle insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle for better mobilization. The suspicious masses described above can now be clearly palpated. These are located partly between the clavicle and the omohyoid muscle, partly also in region V on the subclavian vein. Careful resection of the changes. The exact changes described sonographically with two masses measuring approx. 1 ˝ cm and a median 3rd mass can be extirpated. The two larger masses were also highly suspicious macroscopically. Careful palpation of the entire supraclavicular area, here no further masses. No evidence of lymphatic leakage. Careful hemostasis, wound irrigation with H202 and Ringer's solution and, in dry conditions, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT1 tongue base carcinoma on the left with residual cN2b lymph node status on the left. Overall, adjuvant radiochemotherapy is certainly indicated and necessary here. The patient received a single shot of Unacid 3 g and 250 mg SDH intraoperatively.","Laser resection, Functional left neck revision

Subsequently, endoscopic support laryngoscopy with unremarkable mucosal conditions in the area of the oral cavity. However, in the area of the right oropharynx, the tumor described above was found, starting from the lower tonsil pole on the right, subtotally occupying the lateral pharyngeal wall on the right up to the level immediately above the hyoid bone and with adjacent infiltration of the right base of the tongue. The piriform recess is without macroscopic tumor involvement on both sides. The final esophagogastroscopy also revealed no evidence of mucosal lesions or masses. A PEG tube is then inserted. For this purpose, diaphanoscopy and insertion of the PEG cannula under endoscopic view after detection of a cellular elevation of the gastric mucosa. The PEG tube is then inserted retrogradely using the Sellinger technique from the peroral side and fixed to the abdominal wall with appropriate traction. Sterile wound dressing. A tracheostoma is then created. For this purpose, a skin incision is made pretracheally below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and blunt dissection in the area of the linea alba of the prelaryngeal musculature. Locate the thyroid isthmus and cut through it. A tracheal flap is now placed caudally between the 2nd and 3rd cricoid cartilage and sutured to the lower edge of the stoma. The cranial skin edge is also fixed to the trachea and the lateral skin to each other. Re-intubation. Neck dissection is performed first on the right side. To do this, make a skin incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle, extending caudally and laterally, to improve postoperative lymphatic drainage. Then expose the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle after creating a cranial platysmal flap. Dissection down to the vascular nerve sheath. Then dissection along the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid bone. Now expose the lower edge of the submandibular gland and complete the neck block II/III cranially along the posterior digastric venter muscle. This shows an extensive, approx. 4 cm large metastasis in the area of region II, which is directly adjacent to the accessorius nerve, the internal jugular vein and the hypoglossal nerve, but does not infiltrate these structures. This allows the metastasis, whose capsule appears macroscopically intact, to be carefully dissected free of the structures. Dissection is considerably more difficult due to the growth of the metastasis in the direction of the jugular foramen. Further dissection of the vascular nerve sheath and completion of regions II, III and IV. This is followed by dissection of region V. Dissection down to the trapezius muscle in the cranial region Va while sparing the accessorius nerve. Dissection cranially down to the muscle, and in the caudal region the cervical plexus forms the deep boundary. After complete evacuation of region V (individual smaller lymph nodes can still be detected macroscopically here), the lateral pharyngotomy is performed immediately below the right hyoid bone in accordance with the previous endoscopy. After opening the pharynx, the spherical tumor, which is pedicled approx. 1 1/2 cm above the entrance, shows infiltrative growth in the area of the lower tonsil lobe on the right and the soft tissues of the neck there as well as in the base of the tongue. The tumor is now carefully dissected accordingly. A safety margin of at least 1 cm is maintained macroscopically. Complete the cranial resection from the enoral side using a tongue retractor and detach the tonsil in the right upper pole area caudally up to the transition to the base of the tongue. Final completion of the tumor resection via the lateral pharyngotomy approach. This procedure ensures the best possible view for the tumor resection. The resulting mucosal defect in the area of the lateral wall of the oropharynx and the base of the tongue on the right side is such that primary wound closure appears feasible and sensible. The pharyngeal wall is sutured on the right side, which is done in several layers by suturing the mucosa and the underlying pharyngeal and throat muscles. The wound surface of the base of the tongue and the tonsil lobe remain free. To prevent bleeding due to the deep wound surface, particularly in the area of the base of the tongue, the lingual artery is then ligated at its exit from the external carotid artery. Before the wound was closed, frozen sections were sent in in the area of the edges of the lingual artery and classified by telephone as tumor-free. While waiting for the frozen section result, the neck dissection was performed on the left side. Here, the skin incision is also made in the area of the sternocleidomastoid anterior edge, also extending latero-caudally and dissection of the sternocleidomastoid anterior edge down to the vascular nerve sheath. Now dissect along the omohyoid muscle to the hyoid bone and along the posterior digastric venter muscle to the base of the skull. In the region of regions II, III and IV, there are isolated slightly enlarged lymph nodes, which, however, do not appear suspicious macroscopically. Finally, clear out region V while protecting the accessorius nerve. Dissection down to the trapezius muscle and in the lower section to the cervical plexus. After careful hemostasis, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Platysma suture, subcutaneous sutures and single-button skin suture. Same procedure on the right side. A light pressure bandage is applied for the first 2 days to protect the pharyngeal suture.  ","Partial resection of the pharynx [Partial pharyngeal resection]

Subsequent adjuvant radio therapy of the primary tumor region with inclusion of the pelvic lymphatic drainage areas up to a dose of 50.4 Gy. During the restaging of the bronchial carcinoma, a new, size-progressive mass appeared on the left cervical side. Furthermore, FDG-enriched region in the area of the left-sided base of the tongue. Histologically confirmed cT2 cN2b carcinoma of the base of the tongue on the left as part of panendoscopy <2013>. There is now an indication for transoral tumor resection and neck dissection on the left side. Sonomorphologically multiple suspicious masses level II level V on the left. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.","After active patient identification, the patient is taken to the operating theater. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Carry out the team time-out. Start of transoral resection: ( Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME> ) Positioning of the base of the tongue with the spread laryngoscope, the histologically confirmed tumor in the area of the left base of the tongue can be clearly identified with the help of the spread laryngoscope. Adjust the position so that the tumor is clearly visible. Then use the laser to cut around the process in the area of the left base of the tongue, taking the lower edge of the left tonsil with it. As far as can be assessed intraoperatively, the resection is performed macroscopically in the healthy tissue, including parts of the base of the tongue, the lateral pharyngeal wall and resection of the vallecula. The epiglottis itself remains untouched in both the lingual and laryngeal epiglottis areas. Careful hemostasis. Now take marginal samples, which are found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. Finally, re-inspect the wound bed. If the blood is dry, the procedure is ended. Neck dissection: Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME> After completion of the transoral resection, the patient is repositioned for neck dissection. For this purpose, superficial skin disinfection and infiltration anesthesia with 10 ml Xylonest in the area of the planned incision. Abjode the surgical area and cover it sterilely. Marking of the mandible and the ascending mandibular branch. Marking of the jugulum and the clavicle on the left side. Mark the planned incision in the area of the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sharply cut through the cutis and the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Then cut through the platysma using the 15 mm scalpel and further subplatysmal dissection. The anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle are then exposed. Exposure of the digastric muscle as the cranial border and the accessorius nerve. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the accessorius nerve. Insertion of the retractors below and above. Turning towards the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the internal jugular vein and the venous angle. Overall, the internal jugular vein is extremely weak in caliber. Exposure of the common carotid artery and the bifurcation. Exposure and protection of a relatively large vagus nerve. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve. Turning to the approx. 3.5 x 2.5 cm cervical lymph node metastasis in level II. This can be separated from the cranial part of the internal jugular vein with laborious dissection. There is still a small displacement layer here. Level IIb is then cleared out while carefully protecting the accessorius nerve. Develop the lateral neck preparation. Expose and protect the plexus branches. Palpatory exploration of level V. Smaller coarse nodules can be seen in depth here. These are selectively dissected out of level V while sparing the surrounding plexus branches. Furthermore, an approx. 1.5 cm large, suspicious mass is seen in level IV. Therefore, level IV is also dissected out. Before the specimen is placed in level IV, it is grasped with the Overholt clamp and ligated, as the dissection extends far caudally. Then turn to the medial neck preparation and develop it. Protect the branches of the cervical nerve. Palpatory exploration of level I. There is no evidence of further lymph node metastases. As part of the exploration, also visualization and protection of the hypoglossal nerve. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve. Subsequent hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation with H2O2 and NaCl. Insertion and suturing of a 10-gauge Redon drain and wound closure with Vicryl 4.0 and Ethilon 5.0. Application of a pressure dressing. Completion of the operation without complications. Final consultation with the anesthetist.","Transoral laser resection, Neck dissection

Positioning of the patient. Insertion of the mouth blocker. Exposure of the tumor. After TE, a flat tumor is seen in the right tonsil region, which extends to the soft palate and reaches the posterior edge of the alveolar ridge. Therefore, first mark the cut surfaces with the monopolar needle. Then cut around the preparation with the monopolar needle. The preparation is mainly made with the electric needle and now extends over the anterior and posterior palatal arch to the muscles of the lateral pharyngeal wall and the posterior pharyngeal wall. The tumor does not appear to have grown into the deep muscles of the pharynx, so that the incision plane in the area of the pharyngeal muscles can be maintained over the entire resection area. The tumor is removed at the transition to the hypopharynx. The specimen is thread-marked for histopathological examination. A primary R0 resection is found, but with narrow resection margins in the dorsal and caudal region, so that a resection and new margin sampling is performed.

There is a superficial ulcerated tumor in the area of the right tonsillar lobe with transition over the glossotonsillar groove into the base of the tongue. On palpation, however, there is also clear submucosal tumor growth with at least 1 cm deep infiltration. In addition, tumor extension into the upper pole of the tonsil and here extending to the palatal arches. The tumor is now resected transorally with a safety margin of a good 1 cm. Inclusion of the anterior palatal arch. Resection of the tumor in the area of the tonsil in the sense of a tumor tonsillectomy. Some scarring in the area of the posterior palatal arch. Good lateral control. Submucosal tumor extension caudally, therefore widening and resection of the pharyngeal side wall into the hypopharyngeal region up to approx. 1 cm below the level of the epiglottis. Resection of the glossotonsillar groove and circumscribed resection of the base of the tongue on the right. The specimen is now thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. This shows tumor extensions up to the posterior palatal arch with otherwise in sano resection. Basally, there is also an in sano resection, but with a safety margin of 2 to 3 mm in the narrowest area. This has already been identified macroscopically and marked with sutures. Therefore, the final margin sample is now taken in the area of the basal wound bed, primarily to extend the safety margin in the case of a histologically in sano resection. This is followed by a generous resection in the area of the entire posterior palatal arch and a new covering margin sampling. This is later diagnosed as tumor- and dysplasia-free in frozen section diagnostics. Due to the now extensive wound area, a protective tracheotomy is later performed. First repositioning for neck dissection of the right side. Incision along a skin fold. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure and dissection of the external jugular vein with transverse course. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical artery, the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. The extremely slender facial vein is removed. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Cranial dissection and removal of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and completion of the neck dissection after exposure of the common carotid artery and vagus nerve while sparing all the structures mentioned. Macroscopically no necessarily suspicious nodes. Finally, wound inspection and wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. The tracheostomy is then performed. Skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and sparing dissection of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedunculated Björk flap. Incision of the tracheostoma. Subsequent problem-free transfer to a size 8 low-cuff cannula, followed by final enoral wound inspection and, if the wound was dry, completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected, at least cT2 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Leave the cannula in place until postoperative day 5, after which direct decannulation can be performed if necessary if the wound is healing properly.

Then tracheoscopy: No abnormalities in the trachea area. The mucous membranes here are smooth and unremarkable. The patient is then intubated by the anesthetist. Esophagoscopy: The flexible instrument enters the esophagus without any problems. Then visualized up to the stomach. A clearly reddened erosive mucosa in the form of erosive gastritis can be seen. The stomach is otherwise empty. The mucous membranes show no evidence of a tumor or other mass. After releasing the insufflated air, the esophageal mucosa is then reflected back and carefully inspected. No evidence of a mass or other changes to the mucosa. Hypopharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: No mucosal abnormalities in the hypopharynx and larynx. The vallecula is free, the base of the tongue is free, there is a regular laryngeal skeleton. The piriform sinus can be freely unfolded on both sides. The postcricoid region and the esophageal entrance plane also appear normal. Then insertion of the oropharyngeal retractor and inspection of the oropharynx. In the area of the tonsillar lobe on the left side, an exophytic change in the mucosa can already be seen beginning at the anterior palatal arch, which extends into the glossotonsillar groove and to the base of the tongue. It also appears to infiltrate the edge of the tongue in the posterior third. The mucosa below the lower tonsil pole is free and inconspicuous. The other mucous membranes in the oropharyngeal region appear free and inconspicuous. The mass does not appear to infiltrate the base of the tongue. Tumor resection then begins on the anterior palatal arch. The resection margins are initially marked with the monopolar coagulation needle with a sufficient safety margin. The tumor is then successively removed from the tonsil larynx with subtotal removal of the anterior palatal arch under careful hemostasis. The lower pole of the tonsil appears relatively inconspicuous. Nevertheless, a sufficient safety margin is also maintained here in the area of the transition to the tongue base tonsil. At the transition to the glossotonsillar groove, the tumor can be seen infiltrating into the edge of the tongue as described above. Therefore, in order to have a better overview here, removal of the mouth retractor and insertion of a reinforced sharp hook to open the mouth. Then suture the tongue and pull out the tongue. The glossotonsillar groove and the edge of the tongue can thus be exposed very well. Here too, the tumor is then cut around with a sufficient safety margin and removed. The defect in the tongue is closed with inverting sutures. This is preceded by careful hemostasis. The tumor specimen is then thread-marked in toto for final histological assessment. In the resection area of the anterior tongue margin and in the area of the retromolar glossotonsillar groove as well as on the posterior and anterior palatal arch, several marginal samples are taken for frozen section and sent in. Here the intraoperative frozen section announcement is: all marginal samples are tumor-free. The patient then has a nasal feeding tube inserted via the right nostril. Due to the defect in the area of the tonsil tube and at the edge of the tongue, the patient should be fed via this tube for a week. The patient was then repositioned for neck dissection on the left side. First injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline in the area of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then ablation of the skin. Subsequent skin incision in the area of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth in layers and exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. The omohyoid muscle is exposed in the caudal section, the digaster venter posterior muscle is exposed in the cranial section. Then locate the accessorius nerve. Then detach the lateral neck preparation. It becomes apparent that in the area of the vein angle a highly visible mass must be sharply dissected from the vein wall. However, this is achieved with difficulty, so that the internal jugular vein can be well preserved. After clearing out the accessory triangle, the complete lateral neck preparation is fully developed and removed. The hypoglossal triangle is then removed. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and the branches of the internal carotid artery. All structures are spared. Then develop the anterior neck preparation. In the case of extensive goiter, the superior thyroid artery must be removed here despite extreme caution. The most careful hemostasis is then performed. The specimen is then sent for final histological examination with the tumor. After rinsing the wound and checking the bleeding again, a Redon drain is inserted and the wound is closed in several layers. The procedure is then completed without complications.","Transoral tumor resection, Left neck dissection, Panendoscopy

In CT V.a. growth per continuitatem. Pronounced neck metastasis with infiltration of the nervous and muscular structures on the right neck visible.,"Detailed consultation with the anesthesia department regarding the intraoperative procedure before starting the procedure. Based on the above findings, a PEG was initially inserted. To do this, insert the flexible endoscope into the esophagus. Advance into the stomach. Inconspicuous conditions there. Good diaphanoscopy. Insertion of the PEG using the thread pull-through method in the usual way without complications. Removal of the endoscope. Now ablation of the neck region, the left forearm and the right groin. Due to the previous cardiac disease, there is no possibility of infiltration anesthesia with Suprarenin. Start of neck dissection on the right side: skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Incision of a platysmal flap. Dissection of the flap beyond the submandibular gland. Now expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein, the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve caudally. Evacuation of the supraclavicular lymph nodes in front of and behind the vascular structures. The large metastasis that infiltrates the internal jugular vein can now be recognized. In addition, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is infiltrated. The muscle is therefore removed and the internal jugular vein is removed. Further dissection along the carotid artery to the bulb. Follow the external carotid artery with its branches. It can now be seen that these branches grow directly into the metastasis or are walled in by it. Therefore, the external carotid artery with its terminal branches is removed. The hypoglossal nerve, which runs completely through the tumor conglomerate, is also removed. Facial nerve monitoring was performed before the operation, as the metastasis also extended into the parotid region. Very difficult dissection in this area. Cutting through the tissue of the parotid gland. The facial nerve can be stimulated in depth. Exposure of the posterior digastric venter muscle. Dissection of the same. Beforehand, dissection of the internal carotid artery, which shows clear cranial kinking. It can now also be seen that the vagus nerve extends into the tumor. The vagus nerve must therefore also be removed caudal to the exit of the superior laryngeal nerve. The more cranial part remains intact. You are almost at the base of the skull. Further dissection through the parotid gland to the tip of the mastoid. Separate the muscle there. Exposure of the internal jugular vein in depth, which is completely thrombosed, and here the vein is again ligated and lanced. After resection of the accessorius nerve, it is finally possible to remove the entire tumor conglomerate with muscle vessels and nerves in toto. Now the patient is repositioned and the tonsil barring device is inserted: the tumor is cut around the tonsil lobe, passing over to the base of the tongue clinically in a healthy state. There is practically only a thin layer of connective tissue left. In principle, growth per continuitatem can be assumed. The musculature is extensively incised and circular marginal samples are taken and sent for frozen section. In addition, a marginal sample of the cranial vagus nerve is also taken. All marginal samples are found to be tumor-free. Now perform the neck dissection on the left side: skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth and exposure of the external jugular vein. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, the accessorius nerve, the posterior digastric venter muscle, the external and internal carotid artery. Dissection of the posterior part of the neck from cranial to caudal while sparing the above-mentioned structures. Then exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and dissection of the capsule of the submandibular gland. Dissection of the anterior part of the neck. The superior thyroid artery and the facial vein are identified as good connecting vessels. In the meantime, repositioning of the patient and resection of the submandibular gland on the right side with exposure of the lingual nerve and ligation of the excretory duct after it has been removed. Tracheotomy: Small Kocher collar incision, dissection through subcutaneous tissue up to the infrahyoid muscles. Spreading of these. Expose the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped off, cut through and supplied with puncture ligatures. Exposure of the trachea. Entering the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Creation of a broadly pedicled, visor-like Björk flap. Epithelialization of the tracheotoma in the typical manner with Ethibond sutures. Then insertion of a tracheal cannula with size 8 core, which is fixed with sutures. Now remove the radial flap on the right side. To do this, cut around the flap. Expose the underlying musculature. Expose the ulnar and radial arteries and the superficial nerve branch. Careful dissection in depth and lifting of the flap from distal to proximal. In the area of the elbow, follow the radial artery with the accompanying veins. The cephalic vein is also dissected. Overall, the accompanying veins of the radial artery are relatively thin, so that the cephalic vein is dissected into the elbow and deposited there. Exposure of the interosseous artery. This is left in place and finally the radial artery with the accompanying veins is removed. Removal of the complete radial artery graft. Wound closure in the upper part with subcutaneous and skin sutures. A full-thickness skin graft is then removed from the groin. This is cut around, removed and thinned out considerably. The wound is closed after mobilization of the skin with subcutaneous and skin sutures. A Redon drain is inserted at the same time. This full-thickness skin graft is now carefully sutured in the area of the removed radial flap and treated with a perforation. Then apply a wound dressing with Mepilex without VAC. Now reinsert the tonsil plug and suture in the radial flap. This is particularly difficult in the area of the base of the tongue. Many sutures must be placed here. It is now possible to suture the flap completely into the base of the tongue on the medial wall at the top in the area of the soft palate and completely laterally. Due to the radical neck dissection on the right, a vascular anastomosis is not possible here. For this reason, the vascular pedicle of the radial flap is placed on the left side via a tunnel after suturing. The skin monitor is sutured into the skin after incision of the skin for flap control. The vascular anastomosis of the radial artery with the superior thyroid artery is then performed. The vein is then connected to the facial vein using the coupler. Very good blood circulation. From the arterial side, no congestion in the venous system of the connecting vessel. Extensive hemostasis in the area of the right and left neck. Insertion of a Redon drain in each case. Irrigation. Subcutaneous suture, skin suture and wound dressing. At the end of the procedure, another detailed discussion with the anesthetist. The patient is intubated and ventilated and transferred to the intensive care unit. Further regular checks of the flap and vital functions are carried out there. Note: In addition to the operations listed above, a partial parotidectomy with facial monitoring was also performed.","Tonsillectomy, Free flap (Radial), PEG placement

However, no invasive component of the carcinoma was detected. Therefore, again before planned removal of the change on the edge of the tongue on the right and the floor of the mouth on the right, panendoscopy and sample biopsies, in particular from the edge of the tongue on the right, to definitively confirm the diagnosis or exclude an invasive carcinoma.","First, anesthesia induction by the anesthesia colleagues. Followed by tracheoscopy. This reveals inconspicuous mucosal findings in the entire tracheal and laryngeal area. Now orotracheal intubation by the surgeon. Subsequent orohypopharyngoscopy and esophagoscopy as well as nasopharyngoscopy. A slight mucosal flap is seen at the base of the tongue. To be on the safe side, a marginal sample was taken, which was sent for final examination. No suspicion of malignancy here. Subsequent examination of the enoral area. Here, the flat change suspected of being malignant can be seen from the tip of the tongue on the right to the transition to the base of the tongue, passing over to the floor of the mouth, not exceeding the caruncle towards the middle. In addition, a leukoplakia-like change on the left tongue surface at the back of the tongue. A deep sample biopsy was taken in the area of the exophytic tumor. A marginal sample was also taken from the dorsum of the left tongue. Both are sent for frozen section. In the frozen section, change on the dorsum of the tongue, without evidence of malignancy. Carcinoma in situ with transition to invasive carcinoma at the edge of the tongue. Indication for partial resection of the tongue. The tongue carcinoma is incised macroscopically just under 1 cm in healthy tissue. Resection is carried out basally over a width of up to 1 cm. Resection includes the right half of the tongue and the floor of the mouth. Wharton's duct is partially resected in the distal area. The tumor is removed and marked with sutures, especially basally. Then circular frozen sections are taken, four in total. These are also thread-marked and sent to the frozen section. In the frozen section, both the tumor in the basal direction and the mucosal borders are not infiltrated by tumor after examination of the marginal samples. Thus R0 resection. Careful hemostasis is performed. Part of the lingual artery was bypassed in the tongue body area. The wharton's duct was incised at the junction of the distal middle meatus and sutured laterally to the remaining alveolar ridge mucosa. Subsequent careful hemostasis and irrigation. The procedure was completed without complications. As the resection had not spread to the base of the tongue and deeper oropharyngeal areas and was relatively superficial, a tracheotomy was not performed. Due to the cN0 status, waiting for the final histology, then discussion of neck dissection again.","Panendoscopy, PE (Right tongue base, side, Vallecula), Resection of right tongue margin and buccal mucosa

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the indication for emergency surgery was made.","After intubation and preparation by the anesthesia colleagues, the primary tumor region is inspected first. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube under dental protection. The oral cavity and oropharynx are inconspicuous, but with extensive post-radiogenic mucosal changes and significantly more difficult accessibility. In the area of the pharyngeal side wall already beginning on the oropharyngeal cavity, the ulcer described above is now visible, but the extension extends over the pharyngoepiglottic fold, also on the lateral free surface of the epiglottis and circumscribed on the right side on the vallecula. The base of the tongue itself is free, hardly any laryngeal adjustment is possible, but there is no extensive laryngeal infiltration. An attempt is now made to perform flexible esophagogastroscopy for PEG placement. Despite several attempts, this was not successful due to significant stenosis of the postcricoid region. However, there is no tumor here on inspection, so that PEG placement at this point must be dispensed with in the case of postradiogenic esophageal stenosis. A nasogastric feeding tube is now inserted, which is later surgically inserted into the oesophagus. The patient is then repositioned and prepared. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. Cervical incision in the area of the old scar and curved anteriorly onto the larynx. Skin incision. Cut through the scars, the scars must be sharply detached. Pronounced post-therapeutic adhesions here. Detachment of the skin mantle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and successive retraction of the muscle. Laborious dissection of the cervical vascular sheath. Preservation of the internal jugular vein, common carotid artery and hypoglossal nerve. Successful dissection of the cervical vascular sheath from the pharyngeal tube. No signs of infiltration here. The pharyngeal tube is now released. The tumor tissue is already palpable in the area of the piriform sinus. After release of the pharynx on the prevertebral fascia, the hyoid is released. Half of the hyoid is entrained. Entering enorally in the area of the base of the tongue, here in sano conditions, but position above the vallecula portion of the tumor. In sano resection, a good half resection of the epiglottis, release of the laryngeal skeleton. Resection of the piriform sinus is not possible on the right side, here directly near the tumor. Therefore, resection is performed on approx. half of the lateral thyroid cartilage surface, but here a good overview is obtained. The tumor infiltrates the laryngeal skeleton via the anterior wall of the piriform sinus, the medial wall is again exposed. At this point, discussion of the findings with <CLINICIAN_NAME> regarding the selvage situation and oncological and functional indication for laryngectomy. Due to the extent described above and the corresponding patient information without an explicit laryngectomy discussion, the decision is now made to attempt to preserve the larynx. After complete release of all margins, the tumor is now resected with an adequate safety margin. Resection up to the posterior wall of the hypopharynx and up to the esophageal entrance. Macroscopically in the mucosal area in toto. The basally pre-described lateral site was covered by preparatory separation from the cervical vascular sheath, here further marginal sampling is not possible, however, removal of all lateral neck soft tissue and scar tissue by neck dissection. Complete coverage of the tumor in the mucosal area and explicit coverage of the remaining paralaryngeal soft tissue, here complete coverage of basal margin samples, as well as removal of margin samples in the area of the exposed thyroid cartilage. All marginal samples are diagnosed as carcinoma-free without high-grade dysplasia in the frozen section diagnostics, so that an R0 situation now exists and the preservation of the larynx can be confirmed. There is still an extensive defect. Due to the pronounced postradiogenic conditions and the already highly variable vascular situation during neck dissection, the indication for defect coverage using a pedicled pectoralis major flap from the right is given. Submammillary position of the flap. Measurement of an area of skin measuring 14 x 8 cm. Elevation of a passive deltopectoral flap up to the second agiosome. Strictly subfascial dissection and elevation of the deltopectoral flap. Incision of the pectoralis major flap. Fixation sutures to the muscle, strictly subfascial release. Exposure of the pectoralis minor muscle, exposure of the pedicle vessel, inclusion of a muscle cuff and isolation on the vascular pedicle with an excellently vital flap. Successive insertion of the graft without torquing. Careful suturing in the area of the esophageal entrance around the inserted nasogastric tube while widening the esophageal entrance. Suture to the larynx. Overall tight conditions with an excellent vital flap until the end of the incision. Positioning of the stalk. Subsequent careful wound inspection. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain both cervically and twice pectorally with dry wound conditions. Adaptive cervical skin closure is then performed. Due to the course of the pedicle and the clear post-therapeutic scarring, complete wound closure is not possible despite mobilization of the neck skin, so the pedicle is left open over an area of approx. 6 x 6 cm and covered with Mepilex. Due to the slightly lowered conditions here, split skin coverage is not carried out at this stage. The granulation tendency should be awaited first. Adaptive cervical skin closure and strong wound closure in the breast area on all sides without increased tension. Subsequent completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected ycT3 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the right with circumscribed laryngeal infiltration. Due to the extent described above and the corresponding patient information, an intraoperative laryngectomy was deliberately avoided. However, due to the extensive resection, a significantly prolonged recovery or moderate prognosis with regard to swallowing function is to be expected. If there are no clinical signs of a pharyngeal fistula, an X-ray pre-swallow should be performed on the 10th to 12th postoperative day. Please continue intraoperative intravenous antibiotics for 24 hours.","Resection, Neck dissection

The tumor is removed on all sides in the healthy area with a safety margin of at least 4-5 mm. Most of the arytenoid cartilage on the right is also resected. Parts at the back and top remain. The aryepiglottic fold is completely spared. The tumor is removed. It is thread-marked dorsally and ventrally basally. Marginal samples are taken from the caudal, dorsal and cranial sides. The tumor is removed basally in healthy tissue. Also tumor-free margins, especially cranially. All margin samples are also in healthy tissue, thus R0 resection. Careful hemostasis. Before the tumor resection was completed, a tracheostomy was created for a better overview. For this purpose, the thyroid isthmus was exposed, passed underneath, clamped, cut and supplied with two puncture ligatures. The trachea was then exposed. Entry into the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Creation of a wide pedicled Björk flap and partial epihtelization of the flap. Laryngeal closure is performed cranially on each side using 3.0 Vicryl single button sutures after making two drill holes in the remaining thyroid cartilage. The perichondrium is sutured again using four Vicryl 3.0 single button sutures to create a complete and stable closure of the larynx, also in the subglottic direction. Overlying soft tissues are sutured in two layers, the last layer being the infrahyoid musculature. The skin is then closed in layers with the insertion of a flap. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Insertion of an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube at the end of the operation. Neck dissection on both sides: Start on the right. Curved skin incision slightly lateralized. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection of the lymph node fat package. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath with internal jugular vein, common carotid artery, internal/external carotid artery. Exposure of the vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. All structures are preserved. Successive evacuation of levels II-IV while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain. Neck dissection on the left: This is performed via a shortened incision. Level II and III evacuation with exposure of the structures as on the opposite side. Here too, after careful hemostasis, the wound is closed in layers and a Redon drain inserted. Final inspection of the endolarynx with the MLE tube: no bleeding. Completion of the procedure without complications. Overall cT2 laryngeal carcinoma with spread to the paraglottic and in the direction of the laryngeal ventricle and slightly in the direction of the supraglottis. R0 resection with resection of the anterior area of the thyroid cartilage. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Nutrition via PEG tube for the first few days.","Laryngoscopy, PEG placement, Resection, Neck dissection

Therefore indication for the above-mentioned surgery.,"First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The exophytic tumor is seen in the area of the entire palatal arch with transition to the tonsillar lobe on the right and extending to the tonsillar lobe on the left. Initial PEG insertion: insertion of the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach. After creating the diaphanoscopy, a 9 mm abdominal wall tube is inserted in a typical manner without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall. Sterile dressing. Then transoral tumor resection: insertion of the Mc Ivor oral spatula. The carcinoma is removed en bloc with the electric needle with a safety distance of at least 1.5 cm on all sides. The tonsil and parts of the pharyngeal wall are resected, especially on the right side; on the left side, the upper part of the tonsil pole and pharyngeal wall area are also resected. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section diagnosis. Here the margins are tumor-free and therefore R0 situation. Subsequent radical neck dissection on the left and modified radical neck dissection on the right: start on the left side. Curved skin incision in front of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Lymph node tumor masses are visible which have infiltrated the sternocleidomastoid muscle, as well as the accessorius nerve. The internal jugular vein is also included. Dissection is performed from medial to lateral, hypoglossal nerve, common carotid artery as well as internal and external carotid artery are exposed and preserved, vagus nerve as well. Neck preparation is removed with resection of the accessorius nerve, sternocleidomastoid muscle and internal jugular vein. Branches of the cervical plexus are preserved as far as possible and appropriate. The internal jugular vein is double ligated cranially and caudally. This results in a radical neck dissection. Now neck dissection on the right side: here too, clearly positive lymph nodes, especially in the cranial region. The sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle are visualized. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein and common carotid artery as well as internal and external carotid artery. Subsequent visualization of the vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Development of the dorsal neck preparation while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Then develop the medial neck preparation, exposing and preserving the hypoglossal nerve, superior thyroid artery, facial vein and inferior thyroid vein. The external jugular vein was also preserved. The defect was then measured enorally. Now removal of the radial flap: marking of the radial flap in the required design, total length 11 cm and max. width 6 cm. Marking of the skin monitor. Cut around the skin monitor and radialis flap. Subcutaneous tissue is preserved over the subcutaneous tissue between the skin monitor and radialis flap. Curved skin incision up to the crook of the elbow. Radialis flap is now lifted from first ulna, then also radial subfascial. The radial artery is exposed and ligated. The lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve is exposed and preserved. Successive elevation of the radial artery flap below the vascular pedicle and subfascially in the direction of the elbow bend. Removal of subcutaneous tissue including the superficial and deep venous system in the upper area. Smaller and larger vessels are supplied with clips or bipolar coagulation or alloying. Exposure and confluence of the superficial deep venous system in the antecubital fossa, which finally flows together in a large antecubital vein. Exposure of the radial artery. Separation of radial artery and vein. Supply of the proximal vessels using clips or ligatures. Full-thickness skin is removed from the groin area in a size corresponding to the forearm defect. Here, after hemostasis, the wound is closed in layers and a Redon drain is inserted. The forearm is closed directly proximally and the full-thickness skin graft is successively inserted distally. A Vacuseal dressing with 125 mmHg suction is then applied. The defect of the palatal arch defect is now covered using the radial flap: First, a 2 - 3 finger wide tunnel is created through the pharyngeal wall to the right side of the neck. Then pass the flap from transcervical to enoral. Successive suturing of the flap first dorsally, then ventrally at the palatal arch. Complete closure of the defect from the transcervical side using sutures. This results in tension-free closure of the defect. The skin monitor is sutured to the neck skin. Vessels of the flap pedicle are dissected. The superior thyroid artery is removed and freed from the ...... The superior thyroid artery is anastomosed end-to-end with the radial artery using 8.0 ethylene sutures. Good arterial flow after opening the bulldog clamp. Venous return flow clearly recognizable, but intermittent due to arterial positions. Subsequent selection of the facial vein for the anastomosis. After dissection of the vessel wall, removal of the facial vein. Measuring. Selection of a 3.5 mm coupler. Anastomization of the vein of the flap pedicle with the facial vein using the 3.5 mm coupler. Good flow after opening the vessels. Upright test positive. Good enoral aspect. Finally, irrigation of the entire wound area. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain in the left side of the neck. Finally, placement of a tracheostoma in the typical manner. This is carried out in the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space via a broadly pedicled, visor-like Björk flap. Epithelialization of this. Insertion of an 8 mm tracheostomy tube. This is fixed with sutures. The procedure is now completed without complications. Finally, marking of the sites for postoperative vascular Doppler checks. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Please continue the antibiotic treatment started with Unacid i.v. for 1 week. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube for 7 - 10 days, followed by a diet. Overall cT2 - 3 cN2c palatal arch/oropharyngeal carcinoma.

Tumor extends clinically from the beginning of the nasopharynx to the entrance of the left hypopharynx. In CT growth through the wall. Thus transorally growing multiple tumor on the left. Therefore, the above mentioned surgery is indicated.","First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The exophytic tumor is visible, which starts below the tube, runs over the tonsil lobe to the hypopharyngeal entrance, macroscopically also shows clear further submucosal infiltrations than macroscopically recognizable. The base of the tongue is only infiltrated at the edge, otherwise free. In conjunction with the CT, the above indication was confirmed. Then transfer for PEG insertion: insertion of the esophagoscope. A 9-gauge abdominal wall tube is inserted in the typical manner. This is fixed to the abdominal wall. No complications. Then repositioning for modified radical neck dissection and tracheotomy: start with the left side. First skin incision in the typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection ........ Dissection. Exposure of the omohyoid and digastric muscles. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal and external carotid artery, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Then develop the dorsal neck preparation while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Then develop the anterior neck preparation, exposing and preserving the superior thyroid artery and hypoglossal nerve. Neck dissection on the right side: This is carried out in the same way as on the left side, preserving the structures mentioned there. Overall removal of levels I - V on the left and II - IV and larger parts of V on the right. This is followed by the combined transoral-transcervical tumor resection: Firstly, external carotid artery exposure with removal of the branches. The external carotid artery is fused with the tumor in the cranial region or is very close to it. For this reason, the external carotid artery is resected above the exit of the lingual or facial artery and double ligated in each case. Subsequently, the lingual and facial arteries are also resected and cut. The superior thyroid artery remains. The pharyngeal tube is then removed from the spinal column. Furthermore, the tumor is now resected in a combined transoral and transcervical approach, controlling the course of the internal carotid artery, with a macroscopic safety margin of 2 cm on all sides. Resection extends cranially up to the tube, caudally beyond the hyoid bone to the piriform sinus entrance. Medially, half of the posterior wall is removed. Laterally, approx. 30% of the base of the tongue is resected. Marginal samples are taken from the hyoid bone area and from the caudal area (soft tissue and mucosa of the piriform sinus) and sent for frozen section diagnostics together with the thread-marked specimen. The specimen was tumor-free at the edges, slightly scarce caudally. Caudal margin samples from the base of the tongue and piriform sinus, including the soft tissue, also tumor-free. Thus R0 resection The defect is now covered using a radial flap from the left and the defect is covered on the left forearm: First measure the size of the defect. This is . -13 x 8 -9 cm. This defect size is marked on the forearm. The radial artery flap is incised in the typical manner. The radial artery is first clamped. After 10 min no special features, no drop in saturation. The radial artery is now removed and the flap is developed subfascially. Section towards the elbow. Dissection of the pedicle up to the elbow. Exposure of the radial artery up to the interosseous membrane and the accompanying vein up to the confluence. Exposure and dissection of the cephalic vein. ...... is placed on these vessels. Proximal puncture ligatures, especially in the radial artery. Subsequently, a full-thickness piece of skin of the appropriate size is removed in the groin area in a typical manner. This is followed by wound irrigation, hemostasis, layer-by-layer closure with insertion of a Redon drain. The full-thickness skin is sutured onto the defect and covers it completely. The remaining wound is primarily closed in layers up to the crook of the elbow. Mepilex dressing is then applied and a forearm splint is fitted. Radialis flap is now inserted into the defect and can cover it without tension. Suturing is performed with Vicryl 3.0 single button sutures. The vessels are then sutured. This is followed by an end-to-end anastomosis between the radial artery and the superior thyroid artery using 9.0 Ethilon. Then end-to-end anastomosis between the confluence of the radial vein + superior thyroid vein. Then end-to-side anastomosis between the cephalic vein and facial vein. In each case with 9.0 Ethilon. Overall good flow, good reflux. Vessels were constantly flushed with heparin. Patient received a perfusor with 500 E heparin/h after flap incision. Subsequent careful irrigation of the wound areas and hemostasis as well as layered wound closure on both sides of the neck with insertion of a Redon drain. After neck dissection, a tracheostomy was created. This is typically performed via a small Kocher collar incision. After exposing the infrahyoid muscles and splitting them, the thyroid isthmus is exposed. This is cut after clamping. Treatment with stitching sutures. Subsequent small visor-like, broadly pedunculated Björk flap. This is epithelized in the typical manner. Finally, after insertion of the laryngectomy tube, insertion of the size 8 tracheostomy tube. Completion of the procedure without complications. An enoral check shows good blood supply to the flap with a good aspect. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotic treatment with Unacid, which was started intraoperatively, for 1 week. Nutrition via PEG for 10 days. After that, gruel swallow and, if necessary, build up diet.

She already had a history of colon carcinoma and cervical carcinoma. CT morphology shows a contrast-enhancing mass in the area of the right hypopharynx, which is growing towards the prevertebral fascia. CT-morphologically, an infiltration of this cannot be excluded 100%.","So we start with a biopsy and a frozen section. But first, induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. Transoral intubation, after tracheoscopy by the surgeon. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the tumor. The tumor is approx. 4-5 cm in size, clinically it encompasses the semicircular entrance of the piriform sinus and extends to the vallecula. There is a deep ulcer in the center. After incision, deep samples are taken from this ulcer and sent for frozen section. The samples are tumor-free. Therefore, the decision is made to continue with the tumor resection, as the prevertebral fascia is not included in the frozen section. Storage. Sterile washing and draping. Start creation of a tracheotomy through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. For this, enter below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior tracheal wall and creation of a visor tracheotomy. Creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Start with neck dissection on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland, the cervical vascular sheath, the hypoglossal nerve and the accessory nerve and removal of the neck specimen II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. Then turn to the opposite side. Same procedure here. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and removal of neck levels II a to V a, while sparing the plexus branches. Macroscopically, a metastasis is seen in level III. Then the Kleinsasser tube is inserted and the tumor is inspected again and the pharyngotomy height is determined. The tumor extends to the lower edge of the tonsil, so the pharyngotomy must also be performed relatively high up in the area of the base of the tongue. Then open the pharynx and cut around the tumor with a safety margin of 1.5 cm. The tumor grows in the arytenoid cartilage onto the mucosa of the arytenoid cartilage and the upper part of the thyroid cartilage on the right side must also be removed for the tumor resection. The tumor is placed on a cork for a frozen section. In the area of the base of the tongue, the tumor appears non in sano, so a generous resection is taken here and also sent for frozen section. In the frozen section, all edge samples are free of carcinoma, but in the area of the vallecula up to the pharyngeal side wall there is still carcinoma in situ. Therefore, a resection and a narrow marginal specimen are taken here again. Intraoperatively, it became apparent that covering the defect with a flap would lead to permanent aspiration due to the involvement of the larynx. It was therefore decided to remove the rest of the larynx for functional reasons. This decision was made together with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Then release of the larynx on both sides. On the left side, the rest of the hyoid bone is removed and the infrahyoid muscles are removed and spared. On the right side, the infrahyoid muscles are removed. Then laryngectomy by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. To do this, expose the anterior wall of the trachea and detach the larynx from caudal to cranial with maximum protection of the mucosa. Enough mucosa remains to perform a primary closure in the pharynx. First, creation of a tracheal stump chamber through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and insertion of the tracheostoma. Then perform an esophageal myotomy on the dorsal left side so that the esophagus can be entered without difficulty. Insertion of a nasogastric tube and two-layer pharyngeal closure in the usual manner. Prior to this, a relatively large amount of mobilization is required in the base of the tongue, as there is a large defect in the mucosal area. There is already slight tension in the base of the tongue. However, the pharynx can ultimately be completely closed in this area. At the end, two Redon drains were inserted and the wound was closed in two layers. Overall, the radialis graft could not be lifted completely, regardless of the fact that the patient did not need it in this case, as the lumen of the proximal radial artery was severely reduced and could only be lifted with a very short pedicle. Therefore, the radial artery flap was not dissected further and the existing suture was closed again. Before starting the neck dissection, an esophagogastroscopy was performed and a PEG was placed using the suture pull-through method. There was a good diaphanoscopy. Please leave wrap bandage for 7 days. X-ray pap smear on the 12th postoperative day and continue antibiotics for 3 days.  ","TU resection, Bilateral neck dissection, PEG placement, Tracheotomy

After consultation with the pathology department, the tumor is removed in depth in healthy tissue. Taking into account the marginal specimen, a tumor in the caudal and lateral region is still questionable. The marginal samples were found to be clear, but to be on the safe side, a resection was performed and sent in for a frozen section. This revealed a carcinoma in situ in the area of the base of the tongue. After receiving the frozen section, another resection is performed and a new marginal sample is taken. This is now found to be tumor-free. Hemostasis with H202 and bipolar coagulation. Repositioning for neck dissection on the right: infiltration anesthesia and skin incision from the infraauricular to the jugulum. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue, exposure of the external jugular vein, ligation and transection of the same. Exposure of the auricular nerve, which can be preserved. Deeply incise the sternocleidomastoid muscle, expose the anterior border, dissect the muscle. A large lymph node package is found directly below the muscle; at least 6-7 lymph nodes are clearly pathologically enlarged here. These adhere relatively firmly to the jugular vein. Nevertheless, the vein can be carefully separated from the lymph node package in a healthy layer. The vagus nerve is also visualized. Dissection of the digastricus venter posterior muscle, here too the nodes are already firmly attached. Part of the muscle must also be removed to completely loosen the nodes. Finally, exposure of the accessorius nerve, free dissection of the same. Exposure of the accessorius triangle, lymph nodes here too. Dissection down to the muscle and removal of all lymph nodes in the accessorius triangle, further dissection caudally to supraclavicular. Dissection relatively far caudally, as lymph nodes are still altered here too. Before cutting through the neck preparation, it is ligated and repositioned several times to prevent a chyle fistula. Finally, further dissection of the external and lower common carotid artery, exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, the cervical artery, which must be severed as the nerve runs directly through the nodes. Removal of the entire lymph node package anteriorly, taking the capsule of the submandibular gland with it. Finally, all nodes can be removed macroscopically in toto. In the posterior part of the neck in particular, other nodes had also been removed in depth under the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Hemostasis with H202 swabs. Hemostasis with H202 and aqua. Removal of all swabs, no more bleeding. Another supraclavicular check, no evidence of chyle fistula, insertion of a Redon drain, subcutaneous suture. Skin suture. Wound dressing. At the end of the operation, the tonsil region was adjusted again, the swabs were also removed, no bleeding.

Sonographically, several suspicious cervical lymph nodes on both sides, therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","First, the patient is brought into the operating room. Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, then insertion of the mouth blocker and adjustment of the tumor region, this is somewhat difficult, finally it is possible to expose the tumor completely. The tumor is located in the vallecula, extends to the lingual surface of the epiglottis, reaches the midline and also extends to the base of the tongue. Now positioning of the robotic device. Adjust the camera and the robotic arms. Start the resection at the free edge of the epiglottis, release the tumor, then on the left side at the base of the tongue and finally remove the tumor tissue en bloc. The specimen is thread-marked for the frozen section, in the frozen section isolated cells can still be seen at the base of the tongue, whereby the diagnosis of the pathology is limited here due to cauterization artefacts. Therefore, to be on the safe side, a wide strip of mucosa is removed from the base of the tongue and sent for final histology with a thread marker. Irrigation of the surgical area, monopolar hemostasis, then completion of the tumor resection in dry blood. Removal of the robotic arms and repositioning for modified radical neck dissection.

The patient received postoperative radiochemotherapy up to 80 Gy. In 2004, the patient developed a pT1 pN0 uvular carcinoma, which was resected transorally and treated by neck dissection on the right side. Now the patient presents with a clinically and computed tomographically existing cT2 tongue margin/base of tongue carcinoma on the left side. Due to the ycN0 situation, it is decided not to perform a neck dissection revision. Thus indication for the above-mentioned operation.","After induction of anesthesia and transnasal intubation by the anesthetist, the oral cavity is first inspected and pharyngoscopy is performed: this reveals an exulcerated region of the posterior edge of the tongue just before the glossotonsillar groove with a clear hardening in the transition from the body of the tongue to the base of the tongue. Thus mouth opening with the ...ratchet and reining of the tongue. Set the resection margins at the glossotonsillar groove, about 1 cm towards the palatal arch, then on the lateral floor of the mouth anteriorly, about 3 cm behind the tip of the tongue and medially almost to the midline. The partial resection of the tongue is now performed successively with the electric needle under bipolar coagulation, taking care to maintain a safe distance from the tumor as far as possible. In the area of the maximum extension of the tumor, the resection reaches the midline of the tongue; further posterior, in the area of the base of the tongue, the resection goes back to the left side. In between, identify and ligate the lingual artery. The submandibular gland is only slightly .... The resection is now completed laterally in the area of the glossotonsillar groove, taking away approx. 1 cm of the lateral pharyngeal wall, whereby it should be noted that the palatal arch and in particular the glossotonsillar groove are clearly scarred due to the previous operations. The main preparation is now sent for frozen section diagnostics. In addition, a resection is performed of the area of scarring, transition from the glossotonsillar groove to the oropharyngeal side wall, as the tissue there appears suspicious. In the main preparation, the frozen section diagnosis identifies an R1 situation in the area of the base of the tongue, mainly at the mucosal level up to approx. 5 mm towards the tongue muscles. CIS is also diagnosed in the area of the glossotonsillar groove transition oropharyngeal side wall. Therefore, a resection is now performed in the area of the base of the tongue from medial to lateral up to the oropharyngeal side wall, which is approximately 1 ˝ cm wide and at least 5 mm thick. In addition, a generous resection is made in the area of the palatal arch transition oropharyngeal side wall, which also extends to the posterior oropharyngeal wall and is also sent for frozen section diagnostics. The tongue base preparation is found to be tumor-free, but a region with carcinoma in situ is also found in the caudal area of the posterior wall of the oropharyngeal side wall transition, now distant from the tumor. As a result, a 3rd resection of the oropharyngeal side wall is now performed, which also clearly extends towards the posterior pharyngeal wall and almost to the entrance of the piriform sinus. This resection is followed by a 3rd marginal sample, which is sent for frozen section diagnostics. This was also found to be a CIS in the frozen section, whereby the colleagues from the pathology department have now established that these CIS sites are not continuous, but are interrupted in different areas. Therefore, there is now a strong suspicion of field carcinomatization. Now consultation and demonstration of findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who advises no further frozen section diagnostics, but instead recommends a final, generous resection, which must then go to final histology. This is now done cranially in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall and goes caudally almost to the entrance of the piriform sinus and is sent to the final histology with a suture marker. In the meantime, after consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, a tracheotomy was indicated. For this reason, an approx. 2 cm long, horizontal incision was made directly caudal to the cricoid cartilage. Dissection through subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Identification and ligation of the anterior jugular vein. Identify the pretracheal muscles and spread the last one along the linea alba. Identify the thyroid isthmus and undermine the last one. Clamp off with 2 Pean clamps, cut through and reposition with 0 Serafit suture. Now expose the anterior tracheal wall, form a very sparse Björk flap between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring, this is secured with 2 tracheostoma threads caudally and 2 cranially and after readaptation of the skin, reintubation is performed on a 7-gauge Rügheimer cannula. A nasogastric feeding tube is also inserted. After re-inspection of the now very large wound area, which affects the anterior tongue almost to the midline, the lateral floor of the mouth and part of the base of the tongue up to approx. 1 cm in front of the vallecula and also extends over part of the palatal arch, the lateral wall of the oropharynx and the posterior pharyngeal wall almost to the midline. Intraoperative administration of 3 g Unacid, which should be continued, and administration of 250 mg SDH. Patient goes to the intensive care unit awake for monitoring. According to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, radial flap coverage may be necessary in the interval.","Tumor resection, Temporary tracheotomy, Pharyngoscopy

Very good diaphanoscopy and decision to insert a PEG. Placement of the PEG using the puncture method in the usual way. Very good aspect. When the endoscope is withdrawn, the esophagus is unremarkable and the esophageal inlet is also unremarkable. Performing a microlaryngoscopy: An ulcerated lesion measuring approx. 1.5 x 1.5 cm can now be seen in the left piriform sinus, which could correspond to a tumor. The lesion sits on the thyroid cartilage with relatively good mobility and does not reach the arytenoid cusp medially. The lesion is in principle laser resectable. A PE is removed with a frozen section. The remaining microlaryngoscopy and pharyngoscopy are otherwise unremarkable. The base of the tongue is also soft on palpation.

Hence the indication for the above procedure.","After induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues, tracheoscopy by the surgeon. The trachea is freely visible up to the bifurcation. Then intubation by the surgeon. Now enter with the Kleinsasser tube. Inspection of the piriform sinus on both sides, the endolarynx, the postcricoid region, the vallecula and the epiglottis. Inconspicuous conditions here. Now adjust with the Mc Ivor spatula. Inspection of the tonsils. An exophytic ulcerating mass was found in the area of the left tonsil, which was palpable. Therefore, the decision was made to perform a left tonsillectomy for a clinically highly suspected carcinoma. First grasp the tonsil with forceps. Dissection with the electric needle. Removal of the anterior palatal arch. Dissection macroscopically far into the healthy tissue. Mobilization of the tonsil from the posterior palatal arch, which can be partially preserved. Further preparation of the oropharyngeal side wall. Here in this area, parapharyngeal fat is partially exposed. Further dissection caudally. It can be seen that the carcinoma partially infiltrates the base of the tongue. Part of the base of the tongue is resected here. If the tissue disintegrates very easily, the tumor preparation tears shortly before it is deposited in the area of the base of the tongue. A large slice is then taken as a resection. The final macroscopic result is an R0 resection. For further safety, marginal samples are taken from the area of the base of the tongue, the midline of the oropharynx, the anterior palatal arch and laterally basally and sent for final histology. Minutious bipolar hemostasis in the area of the wound bed. The blood is dry. Relaxing the Mc Ivor blade for 5 minutes, re-inspection. No evidence of bleeding. The operation is therefore terminated at this point. Conclusion: Overall, a high degree of suspicion of tonsillar carcinoma on the left, unremarkable panendoscopy. The tonsillar carcinoma was resected in the sense of a tumor tonsillectomy. If, contrary to expectations, the marginal sample in the area of the base of the tongue is positive, a transcervical resection must be performed. Further procedure after receipt of the final histology and in the further course. Depending on the development, radial lobe defect coverage may need to be considered.","Tumor tonsillectomy, Panendoscopy

Induction of anesthesia. Intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Sterile washing and draping. Entering with the tonsil retractor and inspection of the tumor region. The tumor moves from the uvula to the soft palate on both sides. On the right side, the tumor continues caudally towards the lateral wall of the oropharynx as well as the anterior and posterior palatal arch and the upper pole of the tonsillar lobe. The tumor is now incised using a monopolar needle and a safety distance of 1-1.5 cm. Further dissection with bipolar forceps and scissors so that the entire tumor could be resected en bloc. The tumor is thread-marked for frozen section. All edges are tumor-free in the frozen section. Measurement of the defect, 8 x 6 cm with a protruding boundary for the tonsil lobe on the right side. Perform esophagogastroscopy. After a positive diaphanoscopy, PEG placement using the thread pull-through method. Dressing application. Perform neck dissection in parallel on the left and right. To do this, make a skin incision in the usual manner on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle with a medial bulge. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Showing the submandibular gland. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, the facial vein and the external jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the vagus nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the vagus nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Clearing of neck levels IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Clearing of neck levels Ia and b with exposure of the oral branch. Identical procedure on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of both nerves in the sense of a neurolysis. Clearing of the neck levels II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. Creation of a tunnel on the right to the tonsillar lodge on the right for the subsequent flap pedicle. Lifting the radialis graft. Marking of the graft. Cutting around the graft. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the cephalic vein. Exposure of the venous confluence between the superficial and deep venous system. Visualization of the external ramus, the radial nerve. Exposure of the radial artery. Clamping and ligation of the radial artery. Removal of the graft from the sutures and dissection of the pedicle up to the elbow. The pedicle is placed in such a way that the interosseous artery and the ulnar artery can be preserved. Two superficial veins and one deep vein are prepared for the connection. The graft is then flushed with heparin to ensure good reflux from the veins. The graft is sutured transorally. The back surface of the soft palate is fixed first. The flap is then folded and the anterior surface reconstructed. Finally, the tonsil lobe is reconstructed. The stalk must be pulled through the opening between the tonsil lobe and the neck. To do this, the tunneling had to be widened slightly. The stalk can now be positioned in the neck and anastomosed with the superior thyroid artery. The deep vein is anastomosed with an outlet from the facial vein and the two superficial veins are anastomosed with the external jugular vein and an outlet from this. Very good graft perfusion at the end. Due to the very far cranial location of the tumor and the low risk of secondary bleeding, a tracheotomy is not initially performed. Two-layer wound closure after insertion of a Redon drain on the left side. Insertion of a flap on the right side. Application of a pressure bandage on both sides. The left forearm was covered with split skin from the right thigh. To do this, lift the split skin using a dermatome (7.5 cm) on the thigh. This skin is then fitted to the forearm defect and fixed using single button sutures. Preparation swabs are sutured centrally in the split skin area so that the split skin has contact with the undersurface everywhere. Now create small slits in the split skin. Finally, compression is sutured onto the forearm as large-area compression. Then absorbent cotton dressing, followed by application of a dorsal forearm splint (Cramer splint) using an elastic bandage. Dressing of the thigh using Mepilex. Final consultation with the anesthetist. The patient goes to the intensive care unit intubated and ventilated. Please continue postoperative antibiotics.

Mirror examination and CT morphology as well as panendoscopy revealed a right oropharyngeal carcinoma. Therefore indication for the above mentioned procedure.,"Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Then the tracheotomy is first performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Tracheotomy: Marking of the landmarks and injection of lidocaine with suprarenin. Sterile ablation and draping. Skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Now strict dissection in the midline through the prelaryngeal muscles to the thyroid gland. This is coagulated below the cricoid cartilage and undermined using a clamp. Careful bipolar coagulation of the thyroid gland and separation of the latter. The anterior wall of the trachea is now exposed over a large area and with a good overview. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp. Suturing of the tracheostoma. A 9 mm blocked cannula is inserted without any problems. There was also no bleeding or complications during the tracheostomy. Repositioning and sterile washing and draping. Then insertion of a Mc Ivor oral catheter and start of tumor resection. The tumor is located on the posterior wall of the right oropharynx, crosses the midline and infiltrates the posterior and partially also the anterior palatal arch as well as the tonsil and ends in the vallecula on the right side. Beginning with tumor resection in the cranial part transorally. The tumor is lifted directly from the prevertebral fascia, although this is not infiltrated macroscopically. Involving the posterior and partially the anterior palatal arch. The tumor encompasses the tonsil and can be further dissected laterally. The tumor then reaches far into the cervical vascular sheath, so that fatty tissue and larger blood vessels are already visible transorally. Now the overview becomes very unclear, so the decision is made to dissect further transcervically. To do this, incise the skin in the usual way and first perform the neck dissection. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular and digastric gland, free dissection of the cervical vascular sheath. There are several nodes in level IIa and partly also IIb, these are lifted off the cervical vascular sheath in the conglomerate. This is possible without any problems. The accessorius nerve, hypoglossus, facial vein, superior facial artery and facial artery can all be preserved. Then enter enorally via the existing defect and dislodge the tumor. Then complete the tumor resection from the transcervical side. The tumor is placed on cork and sent to the pathology department for a frozen section. All margins are free of carcinoma and carcinoma in situ. The tumor specimen shows severe dysplasia only on the medial side of the margin to the left. The pathologist recommends taking another resection. This is done including a marginal sample. The margin sample is sent for final histology. Overall, the tumor can be resected on specimen R0. Then transition to neck dissection on the left side. Here again, the skin incision is made in the usual way. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland, digastric muscle, exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Sparing of the accessory nerve, hypoglossal nerve, cervical sinus, facial vein, superior thyroid and clearing of neck levels IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Insertion of a redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Elevation of the radial lobe graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME>: First marking of the 9 x 10 cm graft. Skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Locate the cephalic vein and dissect laterally from this to the musculature. Successive vascular dissection distally. Care is taken here to ensure that sufficient subcutaneous fatty tissue remains on the skin to avoid necrosis. Now carefully dissect the venous star. In the next step, both the flexor carpi radialis and the brachioradialis are dissected up to the ulnar flexion. Now carefully dissect along both muscles in depth. Small muscular vascular branches are glued or coagulated using bipolar coagulation. Locate the pedicle in depth and separate it from the surrounding area. Now further dissection distally. Skin incision of the ulnar flap edge and dissection of the fasciocutaneous flap up to the flexor carpi radialis tendon. The ulnar artery can be easily palpated and spared. Smaller venous outflows are coagulated. Now blunt exploration and dissection with the clamp to find the radial artery. This can be located, shows good pressure and is sutured using a lateral suture. Now further dissect the cephalic vein distally. This can be included in the flap. Lateral accesses are cut off. The superficial ramus of the radial nerve can be spared without any problems. The posterior cutaneous flap is now also dissected from the radial side using the scalpel on the underlying muscles. After further precise exploration of the venous star and exposure of the superficial and deep veins as well as the ulnar, radial and brachial arteries, the flap pedicle is now removed distally and proximally by means of a ligation. Suture the fascia to the subcutaneous tissue to prevent the flap from shearing off. Dissection of the pedicle vessels. Now perform the microanastomoses through <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the radial artery is anastomosed end-to-end with the superficial thyroid artery. The two veins are also supplied microanastomotically using a suture technique. Here the venous vessels are connected end-to-side into the internal jugular vein. After anastomosis, there is a good pulse as well as good filling of the vein after spreading. Suturing of the stalk in the desired position with Vicryl 3-0. Insertion of a Redon drainage and a Penrose drainage. Subcutaneous suture using Vicryl 3-0 and skin suture using Ethilon 4-0. Marking of the Doppler using a Vicryl thread. Final consultation with the anesthetist. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit without any major complications.","Combined transoral-transcervical tumor resection, Modified radical neck dissection on both sides, Tracheotomy, Free flap (Radial)

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment was indicated. Immediate preoperative sonographic cN2b neck status on the left, computed tomographic cT2 tonsillar carcinoma on the right. The simultaneous small oropharyngeal carcinoma could not be visualized by computed tomography.","After intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, a new pharyngoscopy is performed. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube under protection of the toothless chewing ridge. The oral cavity is unremarkable. On the right side, the exophytic change can be seen in the area of the right tonsil. This exceeds the caudal tonsillar pole and merges here with the caudal pharyngeal side wall, the overall extent is just cT2. The glossotonsillar groove is tumor-free. No transition to the base of the tongue. On mobilization, however, there is a spread to the posterior palatal arch at the mucosal level. No infiltration of the parauvular triangle. On the left side, the tonsil is somewhat bumpy and somewhat uneven on the surface. No extensive exophytic process at the site described above, only uneven mucosa. Therefore, in the case of palpable induration, first turn to tonsillectomy on the left side. This is done by removing the anterior palatal arch. Expose the tonsil capsule, this is certainly not exceeded. Detachment of the posterior palatal arch with sparing removal of some muscle. Separation at the lower pole with macroscopically inconspicuous conditions. The specimen is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. Turn to the right side. Cut around the carcinoma with a safety margin of 1 cm. Complete removal of the anterior palatal arch, the parauvular mucosa........ can be kept straight. Here too, the tonsil capsule is not exceeded, with some attached musculature on all sides. No exposed fatty tissue from the neck. Removal of some musculature from the posterior palatal arch and resection of the mucosal portion that exceeds the posterior palatal arch. Caudal separation in the area of the pharyngeal side wall with macroscopic in sano conditions. The frozen section diagnosis now shows a complete R0 situation for the right-sided carcinoma. On the left side, the margins are also free of carcinoma and dysplasia on all sides, but there is also no clear evidence of carcinoma intratonsillar. Therefore, if invasive carcinoma from the transition of the caudal part of the tonsil with transition to the base of the tongue is confirmed, complete resection of this area is carried out in the case of left-sided metastasis; this is done transorally under microscopic control as a laser resection with a 5 Watt CO2 laser. Adjustment of the area with the spreading tube. Resection of the left-sided tongue base edge of the pharyngo-epiglottic fold and the pharyngeal side wall. The resected area widely covers the previously described area. Completely covering and representative marginal samples are now taken, especially basally. Here, completely carcinoma- and dysplasia-free margin samples are found. In the central area of the post-resectate, Cis is found as a possible residual site of the biopsied tumor. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Due to the size of the resection, a protective tracheotomy is performed later. Otherwise, tissue transplantation can be dispensed with due to the localization of the defect. The left neck dissection is now performed. Selection of a submandibular approach. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle. Glandula submandiblaris including the caudal capsule and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve and the cervical artery; the slender facial vein is removed later. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. In the area of the jugulo-facial angle or level IIa, a livid, discolored and highly suspicious mass measuring approx. 3 cm can be seen, as well as smaller, also highly suspicious nodules in the surrounding area. Visualization and release of the accessorius nerve, which can be preserved. No reliable evidence of infiltration of the surrounding structures. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Subsequent evacuation of level Va with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Wound irrigation with H202 and Ringer's solution and after careful wound inspection under dry conditions, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Turn to the right side. Same procedure here in principle. Submandibular approach. After dissection of the platysma, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation and preservation of the superior thyroid artery and hypoglossal nerve. Level II shows several nodules up to 1.5 cm in size and macroscopically also appearing suspicious, also without infiltration of the surrounding structures. Exposure and free preparation of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful nerve protection. Subsequent evacuation of level Va with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Followed by careful irrigation of the wound with H202 and Ringer's solution. Inspection of the wound area and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Then perform a plastic tracheostomy as a protective tracheostomy. Narrow, horizontal skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and splitting of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal rings. Performing a visor tracheotomy and fitting with adapting sutures. Subsequent problem-free transfer to a size 8 low cuff cannula which is suture-fixed. PEG insertion was performed at the beginning of the procedure. This was done with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy to see through to the stomach. This was inconspicuous and clear. Now, with good pharyngoscopy, the stomach is punctured without any problems and the PEG tube is inserted using the usual thread pull-through method. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with clindamycin, which should be continued for 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT2 cN2b/c oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. In addition, R0 resected cTis/cT1 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left. Postoperatively, please abstain from food for approx. 4-5 days, after which the diet can be gradually built up. The tracheostomy is intended as a protective tracheostomy for 5-6 days. With regular enoral wound healing and adequate decongestion, direct decannulation can be performed.

Sonographic and computed tomography V.a. cN2c neck status without evidence of distant metastasis. On CT, extensive oropharyngeal tumor with extensive infiltration of the tongue with infiltration of the outer tongue muscles.","Detailed consultation with the anesthesia department. Positioning of the patient. Performing a pharyngoscopy. An extensive tumorous process of the right oropharynx is seen, growing predominantly submucosally, infiltrating approximately half of the soft palate, palpating hard to the transition of the soft palate. Tonsil lobe is tumorously depleted and massively widened. Transition to the posterior pharyngeal wall. The tumor is completely fixed in its surroundings, no mobility. The tumor extends dorsally close to the alveolar ridge, but does not appear to infiltrate it. On palpation, the base of the tongue is infiltrated to about one Ľ. The CT already shows continuous growth towards the cervix with direct transition to an extensive cervical metastasis, clinically with a coarse, moderately displaceable mass measuring approx. 8 x 6 cm cN3 neck status. First, transoral resection was performed to mobilize the tumour cranially. To do this, cut around the tumor in the soft palate while maintaining a safe distance of a good 1 cm. Subtotal entrainment of the soft palate up to the hard palate border. Adherence here but no infiltration. Therefore, detachment of the process from the hard palate with the Rasper with circumscribed exposure of the bone at this point. Cut around the soft palate buccally. Small tumor cone behind the alveolar ridge towards the buccal side, otherwise no infiltration here, but with pronounced fixation, highly suspected infiltration of the pterygoid musculature. Therefore, the tumor is cut around in the area of the soft palate and buccally. Release from the nasopharynx with resection close to the right tube. However, the tube is still spared. Exposure and mobilization of the pterygoid muscles. Significant infiltration here. Removal of the pterygoid muscles, exposure of the ascending mandibular branch. If there is clear adherence to the posterior mandibular ridge, incision here, paradental removal of the periosteum, thus clearly separating the tumor from the bone. Clearly no infiltration or periosteal perforation. The solution is later completed transcervically at the site of the posterior mandible. Transcervical resection is now performed in the case of an extensively fixed tumor that is growing continuously into the neck. Prior to this, covering samples are taken from the soft palate, the nasopharynx and the buccal margin. These are diagnosed as tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Now repositioning, initially for tracheostomy. For this purpose, a horizontal skin incision is made below the cricoid cartilage and the skin and subcutaneous tissue are cut through. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature, fissures along the linea alba. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Mobilization of the thyroid isthmus, transection of the slender isthmus after strong bipolar coagulation. With a relatively deep-seated larynx between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring, insertion of a broad-based pedicled Björ flap and incision of the tracheostoma with mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequent problem-free intubation onto a 9 mm low cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. Now repositioning first for radical neck dissection with subsequent completion of the tumor resection. To do this, make a skin incision over the extensive metastasis, curved at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the platysma. This is completely preserved and can be separated from the metastasis with a sliding layer. Therefore creation of a platysma flap anteriorly and above all dorsally. Complete exposure. The metastasis infiltrates and destroys the sternocleidomatoid muscle over a large area and appears to be located in the paravertebral musculature. Therefore, first caudal visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Showing the omohyoid muscle. Visualize the submandibular gland, visualize the digastric muscle. First visualization of the anterior venter. In the middle there is a clear adherence or infiltration of the digastric muscle, release of the anterior neck preparation with exposure and later removal of the cervical artery. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. Caudal exposure of the internal jugular vein. This is exposed caudally. Dissection of the vein, this is seen just cranial to the outlet of the facial vein, initially displaced, later clearly infiltrated. The facial vein is also infiltrated cranially. Therefore, both vessels are removed after double ligation. Caudal release, transection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection and release of level 5, showing clearly macroscopically enlarged, partly lividly discolored lymph nodes, therefore also removal of level 5b, mobilization of the omohyoid muscle, removal of the level up to the end of the clavicle. Careful protection of lymphatic structures, no exposure of the subclavian vein. Finally, after meticulous hemostasis, no evidence of lymphatic leakage. Cranial dissection of the extensive perinodal metastasis en bloc. Inclusion of the cervical plexus, parts of the paravertebral musculature, previous exposure of the common carotid artery, vagus nerve and phrenic nerve. Securing the nerves. Cranial release of the muscle hard on the mastoid. Free conditions here. The accessorius nerve is not exposed in the case of complete infiltration. Cranial infiltration of the caudal parotid pole circumscribed, therefore resection of the free caudal parotid pole, here close relationship to the oral branch, which however is only partially visualized, visualization of the digastricus venter posterior muscle, which is also free. In the area of the intermediate tendon or middle area, infiltration or direct contact with the tumor is clearly visible. Exposure of the internal jugular vein cranially. Deposition after double ligation. The metastasis can now be isolated to the carotid sheath, the digastric muscle as well as the area of the paralaryngeal muscles, here direct contact or tumor breakthrough with contact to the metastasis, therefore the metastasis is marked in this area. Cervically, the tumor infiltrates the entire lateral wall of the pharynx in the direction of the hyoid. Level 1b had already been cleared previously. At least one overlying lymph node can be seen macroscopically. Resection of the submandibular gland with partial exposure and protection of the branch of the mouth. The infiltrated digastric muscle shows a tissue turf, circumscribed to the connective tissue of the carotid artery, in the area of the bulb and the division site as well as circumscribed to the prelaryngeal musculature. Therefore, the carotid artery is now completely skeletonized far to the cranial side. No evidence of infiltration of the carotid artery. In case of hyoid infiltration, visualize and release the hyoid. Dissection median, with dissection rather adherence of the tumor than direct infiltration. Nevertheless, take along a good half of the hyoid after triggering. Carefully enter the vallcula, but the tumor can be felt immediately. Therefore widen the safety distance. Enter the pharynx. It can be seen that a tumor cone is directly approaching the petiolus, therefore a good 2/3 resection of the epiglottis. Removal of the hyoid bone as described above, removal of the pre-epiglottic fat, the tumor ends caudally just before the entrance to the piriform sinus. Cut around the tumor with a safety margin. The cone in the area of the epiglottis is seen before dissection as the cause of the circumscribed breakthrough in the area of the prelaryngeal musculature. Careful removal of the musculature, but in some cases complete basal resection through the neck resectate. Now successive exposure of the tumor. Removal of approx. 1/3 of the base of the tongue. Here there is a good 1 cm safety margin on palpation. Resection via the posterior floor of the mouth. In the case of adherence as described above, incision of the periosteum in the area of the dorsal mandibular branch, removal of the periosteum and completion for transoral removal of the tumor, in this case, as described above, no periosteal breakthrough and complete removal. Gradual release of the tumor after securing the carotid artery. A clear infiltration of the hypoglossal nerve was already evident beforehand. Separation of the hypoglossal nerve and, in the case of prolonged, clear macroscopic infiltration, removal of a marginal sample in the area of the hypoglossal nerve. This is shown to be tumor-free in the frozen section diagnosis. In the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, the tumor just reaches the midline. Here also resection with a safety margin, partial entrainment to the further safety margin of the prelateral vertebral musculature, but no injury to the prevertebral fascia. The tumor is now isolated cranially to remnants of the pterygoid musculature. Separation of the remains of the pterygoid musculature. Clear infiltration here. A resection of all muscle stumps is performed in the area of the pterygoid musculature, this is done to extend the safety distance to the definitive histology and covers the entire infiltrated pterygoid musculature. Here, however, also on the preparation macroscopically in sano. On the specimen, the tumor is now macroscopically and palpatorily resected in sano on all sides except for the previously described areas, which have broken through transcervically and are covered here by the neck dissectate or post-resectate. Macroscopically and palpatorily rather scarce areas are marked with sutures, the preparation is completely sent for frozen section diagnostics. Confirmation of the transcervical tumor extension, but mucosal area and also in the area of the pterygoid muscles as well as in the area of the base of the tongue and pharynx on specimen R0 situation. Therefore, hemostasis after careful wound inspection. Measurement of the defect. There is an extensive defect with an almost total soft palate defect extending to the hard palate, approx. 2/3 resection of the oropharynx, 1/3 resection of the base of the tongue, 2/3 resection of the epiglottis and complete resection of the vallecula. Measurement of a graft measuring up to 17 x 8.5 cm in total with corresponding configuration for the soft palate and the base of the tongue. Due to the extent of the graft, a decision is made to harvest an anterolateral thigh graft. Parallel to this, the neck dissection of the left side is performed. For this purpose, a skin incision is made on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation and careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve and the cervical sinus. Exposure and preservation of the facial vein. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Some macroscopically clearly conspicuous lymph nodes, therefore clinical confirmation of contralateral metastasis, but no perinodal growth here. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, evacuation of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Release of level 5 with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Careful wound inspection. Irrigation of the wound. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. For elevation of the anterolateral thigh graft after identification of the landmarks and the perforator line, doppler sonographic identification of the skin perforator approx. 4 cm cranial to the midline. Identification of a small secondary perforator in the area of the midline. Configuration of the graft under pedicle positioning. First enter medially. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the sartorius muscle. Exposure and reliable identification of the rectus femoris muscle. Strictly subfacial dissection, exposure of the vascular pedicle. The division of the lateral circumflex artery into 1 caliber-equal ramus descendens, ramus obliquus and transversus can be seen. The main perforator clearly originates from the oblique branch. The secondary perforator is most likely from the descending branch. Therefore, first visualize and dissect both branches. Dissection of the vessel now shows that both branches open separately into the lateral flexure of the circumflexus. Pronounced venous siphon. After reliable identification of the perforators, complete cutting of the graft and execution of the relief incision. Expose the fascia lata, cut through the fascia lata. With a very strong thigh overall and therefore a strong graft, it becomes apparent that the secondary perforator in the area of the future soft palate can only be utilized with the inclusion of muscle. Therefore, the secondary perforator is not used. The main perforator is purely fasciocutaneous. Installation on the main perforator after elevation of the fascia lata. With excellent flap vitality, placement of the descending ramus after ligation. Insulation on the ramus obliquus, vessel preparation. Dissection of a strong vein after dissection of the vascular findings. With excellent vitality, removal of the graft. Careful wound inspection. Wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, strong and multi-layered wound closure after insertion of two 10-gauge Redon drainage tubes. The graft is now inserted. Multiple sutures are placed transcervically and transorally. Insertion of the graft. Due to the thickness of the graft and the resection up to the hard palate in the area of the soft palate, the suturing conditions are significantly more difficult and the adaptation conditions are suboptimal. Subsequent sufficient soft palate closure. A small dehiscence must be left medial to the hard palate in the event of increased tension or lack of mucosa, but this should granulate without problems. Otherwise, successive insertion of the graft and overall more difficult conditions, but overall good fit. Regular and sufficient insertion with subsequently stable and dense conditions. Meticulous insertion in the area of the vallecula and the pharyngeal wall. In the case of dense conditions, the flap vascular pedicle is now conditioned. This shows a strong vein with a relatively slender artery, therefore dissection of the superior thyroid artery, distal placement. Furthermore, caliber advantages in the area of the superior thyroid artery. Therefore somewhat more difficult suturing conditions. Finally, however, good adaptation with 8.0 Ethilon with immediate regular venous return. Good pedicle pulsation. The first step is to condition the facial venous stump, but this is clearly thrombosed and with clear endothelial damage and a stump very close to the internal jugular vein, no further preparation is possible here, so the superior thyroid vein is conditioned. Regular flow conditions here. Measurement of a size 4.0 coupler. Problem-free insertion of the venous anastomosis, regular pulsation immediately after reopening the clamps and excellent enoral flap vitality. Careful handle positioning, wound inspection and, in dry wound conditions, insertion of two 10-gauge Redon drains in the case of a cervical paravertebral defect and subsequent careful two-layer wound closure. During wound closure, final multiple inspections and completion of the procedure with excellent flap vitality. Finally, detailed consultation with the anesthesia department and transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation. Note: The patient received intraoperative antibiotic prophylaxis with Unacid 3 g, please continue this for an initial 24 hours. Conclusion: Extensive intraoperative R0 resected cT4a cN3 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right with growth per continuitatem into the soft tissues of the neck, clinical metastasis on the right side up to level 5b. Due to the diffuse growth of the primary towards the soft tissues of the neck, an Rx situation should be discussed here. Adjuvant RCT urgently required. Please perform meticulous postoperative flap monitoring by enoral inspection. If the flap is still viable, an X-ray mucosa should be taken on the 10th postoperative day. Due to the extent of the tumor, significantly prolonged swallowing rehabilitation is to be expected.","Radical resection, Neck dissection, Free flap (ALT), Tracheotomy

Due to dental artifacts, it was not possible to determine the exact extent of the tumor in CT diagnostics. No evidence of metastasis on sonography and computed tomography. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was recommended and primary transoral resection was planned due to the initial extent of the tumor.","Initial inspection of the primary tumor region. An exophytic, exulcerated mass is seen in the area of the posterior third of the tongue, at the transition to the base of the tongue. This extends submucosally in a nodular fashion towards the posterior floor of the mouth and palpates and inspects via the glossotonsillar groove into the left tonsil and infiltrates it caudally. Submucosally also clear infiltration of the base of the tongue and infiltration of the tongue musculature. Overall clear cT2 extension. Transorally good resectability, but due to the extension in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth, the base of the tongue and the tonsil loge, indication for defect reconstruction. Demonstration of findings and case discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Confirmation of the extent and initial resection as planned. The tumor is therefore resected, taking the posterior free edge of the tongue on the left. Removal of the posterior floor of the mouth. A slightly extended tonsillectomy is performed. Here circumscribed exposure of neck fat tissue. Resection in the area of the base of the tongue, approx. one third, here also clearly extending into the musculature. Macroscopically safe resection distances. Targeted ligation of the lingual artery, which draws directly into the tumor and finally extirpation of the tumor macroscopically in toto, which is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics and is assessed here as resected in sano. Careful hemostasis. Insertion of a nasogastric feeding tube under laryngoscopic control. Due to the resection defect, there is now an indication for functional reconstruction of the defect. Therefore, initially only the neck dissection of the contralateral side and, due to the depth of resection, the protective tracheostomy are performed. Neck dissection of the right side is performed first. Skin incision along a horizontal cervical skin fold. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation and dissection of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and auricular nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland, taking the capsule with it. Exposure of the digasticus muscle and facial vein. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the facial vein, the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Cranial exposure of the accessorius nerve. Complete dorsal exposure of the internal jugular vein, exposing the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve up to the transition towards level V a, carefully sparing the cervical plexus branches. Overall, macroscopically no suspicious nodules. Careful wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Now create the protective tracheostomy. This involves a horizontal, circumscribed skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose the infrahyoid musculature and enter the linea alba. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Insertion between the second and third tracheal ring. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Incision of the cranial and caudal mucocutaneous anastomosis and subsequent problem-free intubation with a size 8 low-cuff cannula and completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT2 cN0 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right with clear infiltration of the base of the tongue. Due to the defect and the expected functional deficit with secondary wound healing, defect reconstruction using a microvascular graft (ALT or radialis) should be performed together with ipsilateral neck dissection. This should be planned promptly.  ","Transoral resection, Neck dissection, and Tracheotomy

No midline crossing on CT. Tumor extends over the glossoalveolar groove to the lateral pharyngeal wall on the left including the tonsil lobe. Therefore, the above mentioned surgery is indicated.","First laryngoscopy and pharyngoscopy: The tumor extension is as already described, no midline crossing but displacement of the rhaphe. Thus indication to perform the above therapy, no changes. First transoral tumor resection: insertion of the mouth retractors and ligation of the tongue. The tumor is now macroscopically incised on all sides with a safety margin of 1.5 to 2 cm. Approx. 60% of the base of the tongue is resected just above the rhaphe. The posterior half of the left tongue body is also resected. The floor of the mouth is also resected, including parts of the submandibular gland, whereby the lingual nerve is preserved. Resection extends over the glossoalveolar groove. Push off the bone here. The anterior palatal arch and tonsil are also resected, the posterior palatal arch is largely preserved. The resection extends caudally to the hypopharyngeal entrance. The entire specimen is removed and marked with a suture. Send for frozen section. In the frozen section, all margins are tumor-free, no evidence of higher-grade or invasive carcinoma infiltrates. Therefore R0 resection. The lingual and facial arteries had to be ligated during the resection. Overall indication for coverage with radial flap. Neck dissection on the left, split skin removal thigh on the right (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Transition to left neck dissection. Positioning of the patient. Take over the operation from <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Marking the skin along the suture with a pen. Skin incision, separation of the platysma, subtle hemostasis, exposure of the external jugular vein, which is preserved at the end of the neck dissection. Exposure of the auricularis magnus nerve, which is also preserved. Dissection on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the left under the fascia and further medially. Here on the cranial part, the accessorius nerve is exposed and preserved. Dissection and elevation of the skin flap. Further exposure of the most important anatomical structures of the neck such as the omohyoid muscle, hypoglossal nerve, hypoglossal nerve, free dissection of the VJI and its branches. Mobilization with dissecting scissors and forceps of the fatty tissue between the omohyoid muscle, VJI and anterior belly of the digastric muscle while protecting the vessels, which are later preserved for the anastomosis of the flap. Further dissection supported by magnifying glasses below the facial vein on the left side of the gl. submandibularis surface up to the edge of the mandible. Keep the facial muzzle branch out of the surgical area and hold it up by hacking the dissected tissue. Further careful dissection and mobilization of the salivary gland tissue at the posterior and anterior margins. The proximal part of the facial artery is encountered in front of the posterior digastric belly. This was dissected free, only branches to the submandibular artery were coagulated. The hypoglossal nerve became visible above the digastric sling. Coagulation of smaller veins. Anterior mobilization of the gland. The gland is now still partially attached to the excretory duct that was resected enorally during the tumor resection. After tightening the gland, the ganglion is removed, the lingual nerve is bluntly pushed aside, the remaining duct is exposed and removed together with the gland. This intentionally creates a defect in the floor of the mouth and later allows the blood vessels of the flap to be drawn in and the anastomosis to be made. Further removal of the level IIa and IIb lobes while sparing the accessorius nerve. Further detachment of the fatty tissue from the vascular-nerve sheath while sparing the ACI, ACC and vagus nerve. Further exposure of the branches of the brachial plexus up to the level of the junction of the omohyoid muscle with the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Removal of the neck preparation en block. After careful hemostasis, residual fatty tissue is included in the preparation. After the anastomosis, insertion of a Penrose drain to close the wound in layers. The PEG is now placed (<CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>): Insertion of the flexible endoscope under constant air insufflation, whereby the esophageal mucosa is free on all sides and without irritation. In the stomach, air insufflation and visualization of a positive diaphanoscopy. Now PEG placement according to the thread pull-through method in the typical manner. Without complications. Now repositioning for tracheostomy (<CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>): After infiltration of local anesthesia 10 ml Ultracaine 2% with Suprarenin added in the area of the planned skin incision between the cricoid cartilage and jugulum, also infiltration of the neck dissection side on the left. Then abjode and sterile draping of the adjacent areas. Marking of the landmarks and identification of the cricoid cartilage level and marking of the planned skin incision according to Kocher. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature and transection on the linea alba and exposure of the thyroid capsule. The pronounced anterior jugular vein was previously ligated. Then expose the cricoid cartilage and dissect under the thyroid gland using a clamp after exposing the lower pole of the thyroid gland. Then place Pean clamps and cut through the thyroid isthmus, followed by repositioning, first on the right and then on the left, in the typical manner. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea and opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cricoid cartilage. Then decision to perform a visual tracheotomy according to Deitmer. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma with 4 sutures and easy transfer to an 8 mm tube. Transfer for neck dissection on the right (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Infiltration with local anesthetic Ultracaine 2% with the addition of Suprarenin along the planned skin incision after marking the landmarks and marking the curved skin incision. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Cut through the platysma. The auricular nerve and external jugular vein had to be severed after they had been ligated. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Dissection and exposure of the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid. Then expose the posterior digastric venter muscle and the hypoglossal nerve and protect them. Now further dissection on the underside of the sternocleidomastoid and exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial and exposure of the same, whereby bleeding occurs in the middle section at an outlet. This is treated several times with Vascufil vascular suture, followed by hemostasis. Dissection cranially to the base of the skull. Start mobilization of the level IIa lymph node down to the scalene muscles and up to the mastoid. Successive detachment at the cranial end and detachment from the internal jugular vein, then mobilization at the edge of the sternocleidomastoid and finally pushing through under the accessorius nerve, with protection of the latter, further dissection is carried out caudally and with protection of the plexus branches, with removal of the entire lateral neck preparation down to the plexus level. The dissection is performed while sparing the vagus nerve after its exposure and sparing the internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery. Now remove the medial neck preparation. To do this, dissect the abdomen of the submandibular gland, remove the capsule and detach the specimen down to the level of the superior thyroid artery. The hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, plexus branches and accessorius nerve, internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein were spared. Subtle hemostasis using bipolar. No more evidence of bleeding. This results in a modified radical neck dissection level II to V a with preservation of the internal jugular vein, sternocleidomastoid muscle and accessor nerve. Insertion of a Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Subsequent removal of the radial flap: the defect is measured endaurally and the flap is marked on the left forearm in the appropriate, required extent and three-dimensional configuration, including the rejection of the pedicle. Flap length 11 and maximum 7 cm. First lift the flap from ulnar subfascial. Then extend the incision to the olecranon. Exposure of the superficial venous system with connection to the deep venous system Including the superficial venous system subfascially. Dissection of the flap also radially and subfascial elevation. Caudal exposure of the radial artery and the accompanying veins. Clamp off. Subsequent exposure of the radial artery pedicle with accompanying vein. Dissection up to the antecubital fossa. Exposure and connection to the superficial venous system. Two larger cephalic veins can be visualized as well as a radial artery with entry into the brachial artery in a typical manner. A very small radial vein can also be visualized as confluence. The radial artery is then removed when saturation is stable. This is treated with stitches. Successive elevation of the flap along the pedicle. Smaller vessels are treated with bipolar coagulation or clips. Lifting of the pedicle up to the elbow. Lifting including the superficial venous system. The entrance to the brachial artery is shown in the crook of the elbow. The interosseous artery is not severed. The two branches of the cephalic vein are then removed. Ligatures here. Subsequently, the radial artery is also removed and ligated proximally. Separation of the radial artery from the brachial artery. Here suture with 6-0 Vascufil. After removal of the flap, it is rinsed with heparin solution. The hand is always well perfused after removal of the flap. Hemostasis is performed on the hand. Primary closure of the wound in the elbow area up to the skin defect. Finally, a piece of split skin 0.7-0.8 mm thick is removed with the dermatome. This is worked into the defect. The cutaneous nerve to the lateral brachii, which was exposed and preserved during the elevation of the radialis flap, is also taken into account. Subsequent application of a Mepilex dressing with Octenilin hydrogel. Application of loose compresses. Wadding bandage. Fitting of a Cramer splint. Then wrap the hand in the Cramer splint using an elastic bandage. Hand always well supplied with blood. Saturation is almost always 100% at the end. Positioning of the arm. Now incision of the radial flap: First cut the digastric muscle and enlarge the tunnel enorally to a width of 3 QF. Then advance the caudal sutures. Insertion of the flap, first placing the caudal sutures and suturing the flap caudally. Then suture the flap in all other directions up to the cranial using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Tension-free, complete defect coverage in all dimensions is achieved, including the base of the tongue, floor of the mouth, glossoalveolar groove, pharyngeal side wall and tonsil lobe in the area of the anterior palatal arch. The stalk is or was passed through the throat. The left side shows the superior thyroid artery, the external jugular vein and the facial vein. All vessels are conditioned. The vessels of the flap pedicle are also conditioned. The radial artery is anastomosed with the superior thyroid artery using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow and good venous return. The external jugular vein is anastomosed with a branch of the cephalic vein. Coupler size 2.5 was used for this, the facial vein was anastomosed with the other outlet of the cephalic vein using coupler size 3. Good venous flow in each case after opening the clamp, smear phenomenon positive in each case. The remaining small radial vein is closed using clips. Subsequent very careful hemostasis. Irrigation of the entire wound area. The site is now free of bleeding. Closure in layers with insertion of a flap or Penrose drainage. The site suitable for Doppler sonography and flap control was marked using skin sutures. Finally, insertion or suturing of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. Another enoral flap check. This shows a well perfused flap. A hydrogel dressing was applied to the thigh. The procedure was completed without complications. Patient transferred to intensive care unit for monitoring. Please continue antibiotics, which were started intraoperatively, with Unacid for one week.

Insertion of the Olympus mouth retractor. This is achieved with difficulty so that the tumor can be exposed here. It can be seen that the tumor has spread from the base of the tongue to the glossotonsillar groove and the caudal tonsillar pole. Docking of the robotic system. Start of resection in the area of the base of the tongue and the lateral pharyngeal wall at the caudal tonsil pole. From here, resection caudally to the base of the tongue. The tumor is cut around here with a large safety margin. The resection just reaches the entrance to the vallecula. The tumor can be completely removed macroscopically in healthy tissue. Careful hemostasis is then performed. The suture is marked on the specimen. The specimen is sent for frozen section diagnostics. All margin samples and suture markings are found to be tumor-free. However, the marginal sample from the caudal margin is only just in sano, which is why a resection of about 1/2 cm is carried out into the base of the tongue and also caudally into the vallecula at the base of the lingual epiglottis. Here too, another marginal sample is taken, which is sent back for frozen section diagnostics and is clearly diagnosed as tumor-free. Repeated careful hemostasis. If the wound is absolutely dry and the patient can be intubated very well, the patient is not tracheotomized. The patient is transferred to the in-house intensive care unit for monitoring and should remain there over the weekend. The procedure was completed after further bleeding control.

After appropriate preparation, the tumor is initially positioned after insertion of the TE blocker. The tumor and thus the subtotal soft palate is then resected and histologically examined using frozen section histology. On the left side, there are still isolated dysplasias without evidence of an invasive carcinoma. Therefore, a resection is performed at this site as well as a further lateral marginal incision, which then proves to be tumor-free on frozen section histology. Transition to tracheotomy: skin incision in the usual manner below the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the musculature. Splitting of the musculature in the linea alba. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Separation of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Entering the anterior wall of the trachea. Entering the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis after opening the trachea. Re-intubation to a tracheal cannula was performed at the end of the operation. Neck dissection on the right: skin incision in the usual manner on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Right at the beginning, several coarse lymph node metastases are seen and palpated in level II and also in level V. Visualization of the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, the hypoglossal nerve and the cervical sinus. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Dissection of levels II a to V b. The entire neck is full of coarse nodes that extend far into level V b and also partially infiltrate the plexus branches. The smaller branches must also be resected. Larger branches and the accessorius nerve can be preserved. As described above, there are also several metastatic nodes deep supraclavicularly, all of which are removed. At the end, irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer. Removal of the submandibular gland, which is relatively large, and transection of the digastric muscle and formation of an enoral tunnel, which ends directly in the area of the resection, so that no additional pharyngeal defect is generated. The tunnel is 2.5 QF wide so that the flap pedicle can be inserted later without any problems. Turning to the left side: Here also skin incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Showing the digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and clearing of levels II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches and all nerves. Here, isolated enlarged lymph nodes, which are macroscopically not metastasizing. Insertion of a Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure dressing. Then start lifting the radial lobe graft from the left forearm. The defect measures approximately 5 x 5.5 cm. First mark the radial lobe graft and the S-shaped skin incision on the forearm. In the opposite direction, make an incision for the subsequent full-thickness skin harvest. After skin incision, expose and dissect up to the periphery of the superficial veins, one of which can later be included in the flap. Push the two muscle bellies apart and completely undermine the vascular pedicle. Dissect distally up to the proximal flap edge. First incise the flap ulnarly and down to the underlying fascia, which is included in the flap. Dissection up to the tendon of the flexor digitorum muscle. Then cut around the flap, also radially, exposing and preserving the sensitive nerve branch to the end. Here too, dissection down to the tendon of the brachioradialis muscle. The pedicle is then completely lifted off proximally distally with the index finger while protecting it and the flap is dissected distally to such an extent that it only remains attached to the artery. Then dissect the confluence in the area of the crook of the elbow. This shows that a total of three veins can be dissected, including the superficial skin veins. After appropriate preparation of the tumor bed and completion of the neck dissection, the flap is then removed and the defect covered with full-thickness skin from the same side of the forearm. The flap is then sutured and the stalk is transferred to the right side of the neck. The arterial anastomosis with the superior thyroid artery is performed here. In addition, two well-promoting veins are connected to the internal jugular vein in an end-to-side manner. After the vascular perfusion is released, intact anastomoses as well as a vital flap can be seen. The third remaining vein is then clipped after it also continues to pump. An Easy-Flow drain is then inserted in the usual manner and the wound on the right side of the neck is closed. Re-intubation of the patient onto an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube. Sterile neck bandage. End of the operation. Handover of the patient to anesthesia. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist. Conclusion: Subtotal resection of the soft palate for uvular carcinoma and reconstruction using a microvascular anastomosed radial flap graft from the left forearm.","R0 resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

Subsequent laryngectomy and partial pharyngectomy by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: First visualization of hyoid bone. Separation of supra- and infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the left superior cornu. Here, however, the pharynx is not separated from the superior cornu due to the situation of the hypopharyngeal carcinoma. On the right side, the pharyngeal tube is separated from the superior cornu and the piriform sinus is exposed. Then dissect the infrahyoid musculature and thyroid tissue from the larynx and cut caudally. Cranial dissection through the perilymphatic fatty tissue. Exposure of the epiglottis from the outside, opening of the larynx. Successive development of the larynx to save mucosa, especially on the right. The tumor is visible on the left side. Incision with at least 1.5 cm safety margin on all sides. This results in a partial pharyngectomy on the left, whereby the side walls and also the postcricoid area can be well preserved. Further development of the larynx. Then caudal placement in the area of the tracheotomy, whereby the trachea is extended dorsally for insertion. Removal of the larynx. Marking of the specimen.

Primary external surgery already recommended during panendoscopy.final histology and then discussion in the interdisciplinary tumor conference. Plan closure of tracheostoma at intervals.,"Once again, after intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy as well as MLE. The distended tumor can be seen, which is located on both vocal folds, reaches just in front of the arytenoid region and extends to the anterior commissure in each case. Overall, with clearly deep tumor growth, laser resection does not make sense, but rather an external approach. Therefore now repositioning. Skin disinfection. Injection of a total of 10 ml with Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline. Sterile draping. Z-incision with the possibility of creating a tracheostomy underneath. Subsequent dissection of the subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the larynx. Creation of a perichondrium flap, which extends from right to left and is pedicled there. Subsequent insertion into the larynx after sawing out a triangle, which protrudes anteriorly and to the right. Then push off the mucosa and the perichondrium on both sides directly from the cartilage to behind the arytenoid region. After enoral inspection, now subglottic entry, from there development of the tumor also subglottically at the upper edge of the cricoid cartilage. Then develop the tumor supraglottically on both sides, whereby the pocket fold must also be resected on both sides. Posterior resection of the anterior lower parts of the arytenoid cartilage on both sides, but the main part at the back remains intact. The tumor is removed in its entirety and also marked with sutures. Due to the extent of the tumor, marginal samples are taken. Left supraglottic margin specimens with anterior suture marking, left subglottic anterior/subglottic left suture marking anterior basal left with paraglottic musculature, subglottic right anterior suture, right arytenoid region, supraglottic right, paraglottic basal right with musculature and supraglottic right with anterior suture marking. All frozen section margin samples without evidence of tumor, thus R0 resection. Careful hemostasis is now performed. Now, due to the extent of the tumor and the expected temporary dysphagia, a tracheostoma is created: This is done through a small Kocher incision, which is made caudally. Visualization of the trachea. Insertion between the second and third tracheal cartilage. Creation of a modified Björk flap. This is epithelized in the typical manner, without tension. Subsequently reintubation and insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. Then closure of the larynx. Drill holes are made and the thyroid cartilage is sutured together using 3.0 Vicryl single-button sutures. Subsequent suturing of the perichondrial flap with the perichondrium lying inwards on the right side, ensuring tension-free, complete and secure closure. Then suture the infrahyoid muscles. Flap insertion and layered wound closure. Application of Steristrip dressing. Completion of the procedure without complications. Overall extensive cT2 laryngeal carcinoma with infiltration of the glottis up to just before the arytenoid region as well as parts of the supraglottic region, mainly on the left, less so on the right. The arytenoid region is essentially preserved, dysphagia to be expected temporarily. Therefore temporary placement of a nasogastric tube.

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was recommended. CT diagnostics showed the primary tumor to be poorly defined in the area of the right piriform sinus. There was also an unclear change in the right tonsil. The most recent ultrasound showed a cN1 neck status on the right.","After positioning the patient, first enter with the small irrigation tube while protecting the dental ridge. Inconspicuous oral cavity. Careful inspection of the oropharynx, especially the tonsil regions. Careful palpation and inspection. There are absolutely symmetrical, slightly bumpy and cryptic tonsils on both sides, absolutely idem in lateral comparison. Therefore, no further measures are taken here. Adjustment of the endolarynx. This is inconspicuous and free. The same applies to the left hypopharynx. In the area of the right piriform sinus, starting in the entrance area, an exophytic, coarse mass is now visible, relatively well demarcated. This extends from the piriform sinus over the posterior and lateral wall to just before the tip and can be easily moved by palpation, but has an infiltration depth or tumor thickness of just under 1 cm. Due to the good displaceability and visualization, the decision was made to perform a primary laser resection. Resection of the tumor with the CO2 laser 2.0 W, microscopically controlled. Complete removal. Good controllability in the depth range. Slightly more difficult resection conditions in the direction of the tip of the piriform sinus. Otherwise complete in-sano removal with particularly good control in the direction of deep growth. The entire tumor in the area of the mucosa is now covered with marginal samples. In addition, samples are taken from the basal tissue and the muscles located here. All samples are diagnosed as tumor- and dysplasia-free. An R0 situation can therefore be assumed here. Careful hemostasis. Due to the resection area with contact to the lateral hypopharyngeal side wall, a tracheostomy is later indicated. Performing flexible esophagogastroscopy for the planned PEG insertion: Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. Despite optimized positioning, there is no diaphanoscopy. Therefore, a PEG insertion must be dispensed with at this point. A nasogastric feeding tube is inserted under laryngoscopic control. Repositioning for neck dissection. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. Start on the right side. Clearly palpable, coarse mass of a good 3 cm in size at level II. Dissection of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure and preservation of the auricularis magnus nerve. The external jugular vein is removed. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation, carefully preserving the facial vein, the cervical vein, the hypoglossal nerve and the superior thyroid artery. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. The highly suspicious mass described above can be seen in the area of the jugulofacial angle. After careful dissection, the metastasis can be detached from the internal jugular vein, the accessorius nerve and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Release of the accessorius triangle and clearing of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. A clearly suspicious mass is also visible in level III, lateral to the internal jugular vein. Dissection up to the transition to level V b. Final wound inspection. In dry wound conditions, after wound irrigation, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Repositioning to the opposite side. In principle exactly the same procedure here. After exposing the surrounding musculature, evacuation of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical artery, the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve and the facial vein. Here, too, a mass measuring a good 2.5 cm was found in the area of the jugulofacial angle. Macroscopically clearly suspicious. Therefore, complete evacuation of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Clearing of level V a with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches, protection and exposure of the common carotid artery and vagus nerve. Final inspection. Careful hemostasis. Wound irrigation, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drainage, two-layer wound closure. Finally, a protective tracheotomy is performed: for this purpose, a skin incision is made approx. 1 cm below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose and cut through the infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björ flap and subsequent insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Easy transfer to a size 8 low-cuff cannula. Final enoral inspection of the resection area. The procedure was completed with dry wound conditions and no indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT2 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Intraoperative high-grade cN2c neck status. Please feed via the inserted nasogastric feeding tube for about 4-5 days. After that, gradual diet build-up possible. Due to the adjuvant therapy that will certainly be required, a second PEG should be inserted. However, this should not be done before the 10th postoperative day. If swallowing function and enoral healing are normal, decannulation should be possible during the inpatient course.","Laser resection, Neck dissection, and Tracheotomy

There was no evidence of a suspicious mass. Subsequent gross needle PE of the right cervical lymph node. In this case squamous cell carcinoma. The diagnosis of CUP cN2b on the right was then made. The PET-CT shows an enhancement in the area of the oropharynx/tonsil lobe on the right. In addition, the right cervical lymph node metastasis was found to be growing almost to the primary in question per continuitatem. Based on the medical history and clinical findings, indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","First, the patient is taken to the operating room, then the team time-out is carried out and active patient identification and consultation with anesthesia colleagues are performed. Induction of anesthesia and tracheobronchoscopy with the aid of the laryngeal blade and 0° optics. Entering the glottis and pre-mirroring up to the carina. Unobtrusive mucosal conditions on all sides of the carina, trachea, vocal folds, subglottic and glottic area. Then intubation by the surgeon. The surgeon then positions the head and inspects and palpates the oral cavity and oropharynx. The right tonsil is more palpable than the left tonsil. The base of the tongue is palpably unremarkable and soft, as are the tongue and the floor of the mouth. Now re-inspect the oropharynx, larynx and hypopharynx with the type C small bore tube. This reveals the tonsil with a small ulcer, possibly suspicious. Otherwise, the base of the tongue, the vallecula, the epiglottis, the piriform sinuses on both sides, the aryepiglottic folds, the arytenoid cartilage, the glottic plane, the vocal folds and the epiglottis, posterior pharyngeal wall and posterior and lateral walls of the hypopharynx are unremarkable. On the right paramedian posterior wall of the oropharynx, the ACI is visible both by inspection and palpation; it does not reach the tonsil lobe. Now insert the McIvor oral spatula while protecting the lips, teeth and tongue. Demonstration of findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. In the case of primary tonsillitis in the tonsil larynx, tonsillectomy, which goes to the frozen section. The tonsil is grasped at the upper pole and a parauvular mucosal incision is made, which is extended cranially as well as ventrally and dorsally caudally. The tonsil is dissected out along its capsule using a rasparator and deposited very far caudally at the base of the tongue after bipolar coagulation. The tonsil is marked with a suture in the area of the wound base, where the tumor is most likely to be palpated, and caudally at 6 o'clock. The tonsil lobe is free of tumor on inspection and palpation. The tonsil goes to the frozen section. Here, the wound base is marginally R0 less than 0.1 cm, and also marginally R0 ventrally at 9 o'clock in the direction of the anterior palatal arch, but with margin-forming CIS. The remaining caudal, dorsal and cranial margins are free. After consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, resection in the sense of a margin sample in the wound bed, this is thread-marked for final histology, marked cranially in the wound bed of the wound bed and marked ventrally towards the anterior palatal arch. In addition, resection of the anterior palatal arch marked cranially with a suture and then another marginal sample of the anterior palatal arch consisting of 2 parts, each marked cranially with a suture. Now detailed hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation. Macroscopically no more evidence of tumor. The ACI is not in the area of the resection bed, but close enough. No opening towards the neck. Insertion of hydrogen swabs. Repeated inspection using a small mirror. No further bleeding. Unblocking, head elevation. No further bleeding. Now insertion of a PEG in the typical manner using the pull-through technique after a clear diaphanoscopy and after disinfection of the upper abdomen. This was successful without any problems. The procedure was completed without complications and the surgeon repositioned the head. Conclusion: V.a. cT1 cN2b tonsillar carcinoma, in the frozen section margin-forming CIS on the anterior palatal arch and squamous cell carcinoma marginal R0. Subsequently, further marginal samples were taken at the base of the wound and on the anterior palatal arch. Awaiting the final histology. Two-stage neck dissection. To be on the safe side, clarification for flap coverage in case an oropharyngeal fistula could develop as a result of the neck dissection.","Tonsillectomy, Panendoscopy

Then advance the 0° telescope through the glottic plane into the trachea. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions in the area of the trachea. Further advancement of the endoscope to the exit of the segmental bronchi on both sides. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions on all sides. Now intubate the patient. Then advance the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach. Careful reflection back. Inconspicuous findings in the area of the esophagus. Now inspect the hypopharynx on both sides and the postcricoid region: Inconspicuous mucosal conditions. Inspection of the oropharynx and the oral cavity: normal mucosal conditions on all sides. Adjustment of the larynx with the small small bore tube (size C). Exposure of the glottic plane is very difficult with this tube. A large tumor is seen, which starts from the right vocal fold and extends to the transition from the middle to the posterior third of the vocal fold. The tumor extends to the anterior commissure. It is not possible to differentiate the tumor from the left side by microlaryngoendoscopy. Try to adjust the glottic plane with the smallest tube. Here too, a safe resection is not possible with a known malignant tumor. Therefore, indication for an external procedure. Application of local anesthesia in the prelaryngeal soft tissue area. Abjode and cover the surgical area. Zigzag incision in the median line. Dissection through the fatty tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the linea alba. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the ligamentum conicum. Opening of the larynx in the median line after the ligamentum conicum has been split. Careful opening of the larynx by dissecting the supraglottis and subglottis. A voluminous tumor is seen, which fills the vocal fold on the right and starts from the transition from the posterior to the middle third of the vocal fold, freely invades the morgue sinus..........................., the subglottic slope and extends to just before the anterior commissure. Clinically, no tumor is detectable on the left side. However, there is a circumscribed leukoplakia on the left side in the area of the anterior third of the vocal fold, which is left in place during further dissection. This should be removed during a control microlaryngoendoscopy 6-8 weeks postoperatively. Now return to the tumor. This tumor extends forward to the ligamentum conicum. Careful resection of the tumor and clinical removal of the tumor in healthy tissue. The vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage is freed of mucosa. The resection covers the areas of tumor extension described above, whereby the tumor has not infiltrated deep into the vocalis muscle so that parts of the vocalis muscle can be preserved. Careful hemostasis. Removal of six marginal samples. Careful hemostasis. As part of the frozen section diagnosis, a carcinoma in situ is diagnosed in the area of the posterior margin sample below the arytenoid cartilage. As a result, resection is performed. The new frozen section histology shows a tumor-free resection. After careful hemostasis, two drill holes were made in the area of the thyroid cartilage. Closure of the thyroid cartilage with two Vicryl sutures. Reconstruction of the ligamentum conicum. Irrigation of the wound with water and hydrogen. Readaptation of the infrahyoid musculature after insertion of a flap. Wound closure in layers. Wound dressing. Final consultation with the anesthetist. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit extubated and should be observed there for two days postoperatively. The patient therefore has a T1a laryngeal carcinoma, which was resected in healthy tissue using frozen section histology. Due to the extent of the tumor, a control microlaryngoendoscopy is absolutely necessary in 6-8 weeks. Attention should also be paid to the anterior third of the vocal fold on the left. As the resection did not include the anterior commissure of the left side, the insertion of a Keel is dispensed with.","Partial laryngeal resection, MLE, Panendoscopy

The patient subsequently evaded follow-up treatment and presented <2017> with a large mass at the base of the left tongue. Surgical treatment is the only curative treatment option.","Induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. Then sterile washing and draping of the neck. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the hypopharynx and larynx. There is an exophytic mass at the base of the tongue on the left side, which extends down to the pocket fold. The vallecula and epiglottis are completely consumed. The tracheotomy was then performed. Wash down the neck area. Mark the skin incision below the cricoid cartilage, where the apron flap will later be made, and dissect down to the trachea. Dissection of the muscles and insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage and creation of a visor tracheostomy. Subsequent tracheostoma placement: here dictated by colleagues. Neck dissection on the right and removal of split skin from the right thigh by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Now start of the operation with marking of the skin incisions. These run symmetrically on the left and right side of the neck like an apron flap over the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides up to the jugulum. Ending approx. 2 cm from the tracheostoma on both sides. The apron flap is then formed with an incision through the subcutaneous tissue and through the platysma. The platysma is then dissected on both sides in a cranial direction towards the hyoid bone and mandible. Carefully dissect and protect the venous vessels. The neck is massively scarred on both sides following radiochemotherapy. Now simultaneous neck dissection on both sides, left through <CLINICIAN_NAME>, right through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Neck dissection on the right: First dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid bone as well as finding and exposing the posterior digaster venter muscle. Dissection of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and most careful dissection along the internal jugular vein to the facial vein and dissection of the facial vein. Exposure of the cervical profunda. Exposure of the deep plexus branches and the accessorius nerve. Later exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Dissection of the common carotid artery and the internal and external carotid arteries. Later exposure of the neck vessels through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Removal of the sparse lateral and anterior neck dissection. Neck dissection on the left: Then creation of an apron flap in the usual manner, this is already relatively difficult as the neck is severely altered postradiogenically. The patient has an extremely thin platysma. Finally, it is possible to dissect the apron flap upwards. Then start with the neck dissection on the left side. The neck vessels and the entire area are heavily scarred. There is relatively little fatty tissue on both sides of the neck, exposing the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Then exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, this is extremely difficult in the patient due to the scarred conditions. Finally, removal of a very narrow neck preparation while sparing the plexus branches. Removal of the split skin from the right thigh and closure of the forearm wound with suturing of the split skin. by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: While <CLINICIAN_NAME> lifts the radialis flap on the left and a defect measuring 16 x 10 cm was measured here, the split skin with the dermatome is now removed from the right thigh. To do this, a strip of split skin approx. 20 cm long and a maximum of 7.5 cm wide is first lifted. As this tears slightly in several places, a second strip of split skin approx. 10 cm long and 7.5 cm wide is removed with the dermatome. Then hemostasis with starch powder and Mepilex dressing system. Now suture the split skin on the left forearm. Here, Vicryl 5-0 perichondrium is first sutured over exposed tendons in several places. The subcutaneous suture and the skin suture are then performed proximally in two layers. The longer split skin strip is then sutured in the middle and proximally to distally with 5-0 Ethilon. An additional strip of split skin approx. 6 x 2.5 cm long must then be sutured in on the ulnar side, also with 5-0 Ethilon. Another strip approx. 8 x 3 cm long must be covered with split skin on the radial side. The three pieces of split skin are also sutured together with Ethilon 5-0. Subsequently, relief incisions are made so that any hematoma or seroma can drain away. Preparation swabs are inserted to prevent the graft from lifting and the dressing is applied. Subsequently, combined transoral-transcervical tumor resection: Start with the tumor resection from the transoral side to mark the tumor there. In the area of the base and edge of the tongue, including the anterior palatal arch, a sample was taken and squamous cell carcinoma was found, which meant that most of the palatal arch on the left side had to be removed as well as large parts of the uvula and the tonsil region. Then further dissection from the transcervical side, where 2/3 of the tongue at the base of the tongue had to be resected, leaving only a narrow strip on the right side. However, the lingual artery can be safely preserved and also ensure blood supply to the tongue. The tumor extends caudally into the pocket fold region and also involves the entire epiglottis and the vallecula. This must be removed up to the petiolus. Ultimately, only the level of the vocal folds remains of the larynx and there are no protective mechanisms left to protect the patient from aspiration; this finding is demonstrated intraoperatively on <CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. A joint decision is made to remove the larynx. The patient has previously given her verbal consent. This procedure was also discussed verbally with the relevant GP in advance. Then removal of the larynx. The corresponding 15 x 10 cm defect is then covered by <CLINICIAN_NAME> with a radial lobe graft. Subsequent removal of the radial lobe by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Attachment of the arm. Measurement of the defect. This has a length of 15 to 16 cm and a width of 10 cm. Flap is planned in its three-dimensional configuration and size and drawn on the forearm. The flap is then first cut radially. Lifting subfascially. Cut to the crook of the elbow. Expose the superficial venous system and connection to the deep venous system. 1 to 2 outlets of the cephalic vein and a good confluence can be visualized. Then cut around the flap radially. Lift off subfascially, taking care to ensure that tissue remains on the tendons, as on the ulnar side. The radial nerve with its ramus cutaneus antebrachii lateralis is preserved as far as possible. Exposure of the radial artery distally. Clamping. Good saturation after an adequately long clamping time. Dissection of the artery, treatment using 4-0 Prolene puncture ligatures. Then lift the flap along the pedicle. Smaller vessels are bipolarly coagulated or clipped. The interosseous artery is first clamped and then clipped while maintaining good saturation. Subsequent exposure of the pedicle vessels. Removal of the veins, which are ligated. Subsequently, the artery, which is supplied with 6-0 Vascufil suture, is removed. Extensive irrigation of the radial artery flap with heparin. Removal of split skin from the thigh area in the corresponding size of the defect. Suturing of the flap by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Successive suturing of the flap. The defect extends from next to the esophageal opening to the nasopharynx. The flap is sutured successively into the defect in the required three-dimensional configuration. Tension-free and complete defect coverage is achieved. The flap is then anastomosed. Both sides of the neck must be explored extensively for this, as the vessels sometimes carry no blood at all or are thrombosed after brief clamping. Finally, the superior thyroid artery on the opposite side can be dissected. This shows good blood flow even after opening and clamping. Slight incision of the lumen of the vessel like a fish mouth. The superior thyroid artery is then anastomosed with the radial artery after appropriate conditioning using 9-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and good venous return. 2 venous anastomoses are created. A large outlet in the area of the confluence is anastomosed with an outlet from the facial vein, after appropriate conditioning, using a 2.5 mm coupler. Outlets at the facialis or smaller outlets in the area of the confluence are clipped. The cephalic vein is trimmed and anastomosed with the external jugular vein. To do this, the external jugular vein must be further mobilized to lengthen it and the sternocleidomastoid muscle must be partially severed to ensure a tension-free anastomosis. This can be created with Coupler 2.0 mm after appropriate conditioning of the veins. Here too, after opening the clamps, as with the previous vein, good venous flow and positive smear phenomenon. Subsequent careful irrigation of the wound area. Intraoperative flap check shows good blood flow. If the site is free of bleeding, the wound is now closed in the typical way in layers with epithelialization of the tracheostoma and insertion of a Redon drain on the left and 2 flaps on the right. Another intraoperative check of the flap transorally. This is well perfused. Then removal of the laryngectomy tube, insertion of an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube and fixation with sutures. The procedure is completed without complications. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit on a ventilator for monitoring. Please continue the antibiotic treatment, which was started intraoperatively, for 1 week with Unacid. Feeding via the PEG tube for at least 2 weeks, then gruel and, if necessary, cautious diet build-up. Flap control in typical manner for 5 days closely meshed by means of clinical control and Doppler sonography. Total of T4 residual tumor treated by salvage resection and radial flap.","Tumor resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Due to the pronounced and penetrating depth, the above-mentioned operation including flap coverage was indicated.","Pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: confirmation of the extent of the tumor. Then repositioning for surgery: covering of all relevant surgical areas, injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into each side of the neck. Start with transoral tumor resection: insertion of Mc Ivor spatula. Exposure of the tumor. Cut around the tumor with a safety margin of approx. 2 cm along the mucosa. Resection includes anterior palatal arch up to the uvula. Posterior palatal arch can remain. A layer in the pharyngeal region can be dissected without showing tumor infiltration. Resection also includes the glossotonsillar groove along the alveolar ridge and parts of the base of the tongue and extends to the entrance of the hypopharynx. Tumor specimen is removed, thread-marked and sent for frozen section. Mucosal margins free in the frozen section, basal superior and inferior also free, basal medial near the large vessels forming a tumor margin. Therefore, definitive indication for resection of the entire pharyngeal wall and flap coverage. Neck dissection on the right and completion of the tumor resection from transcervical: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid anterior wall. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, the facial nerve with several outlets. Depiction of the internal carotid artery, external carotid artery and several branches. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Subsequent clearing of levels II to V while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Some enlarged lymph nodes cranially in levels II to III, macroscopically not clearly suspicious of malignancy. Then completion of the tumor resection from transcervical. The external and internal carotid arteries as well as the hypoglossal nerve and jugular vein are all marked using vessel loops and dissected from the pharyngeal wall. Subsequently, resection of the entire pharyngeal wall from the upper tonsil pole to the beginning of the base of the tongue under external and internal control. The pharynx was also suture-marked there. In the frozen section, there was no tumor here laterally towards the vessels. Thus final R0 resection. Neck dissection is then performed on the left: It is started from <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> and then completed. As on the opposite side, this is followed by visualization of all structures and level II-IV clearing. No significant enlarged lymph nodes here either. Subsequent tracheostoma placement: small Kocher collar incision here. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature, which is split. Subsequent exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped off, severed and supplied with puncture ligatures. The anterior surface of the trachea is then exposed. Creation of a broadly pedicled, modified Björk flap. This is then epithelialized in the typical manner to make it virtually tension-free. Then reintubation. Insertion of an 8 mm tracheostomy tube. Tracheotomy was performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Flap then removed from the left forearm: After measuring the size approx. 10 x 7 cm, mark the flap in the corresponding size dimension on the left forearm. Skin incision from the crook of the elbow curved to the flap borders, then ulnar. Lift the flap subfascially from the ulnar side. Outgoing vessels are ligated or bipolized or clipped. Subsequent visualization of the superficial vein system. Visualization of a connection between the superficial and deep venous system. Exposure of the pedicle under the brachioradialis muscle. Then recutting of the flap from the ulnar side. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. Distal exposure of the radial artery, which is first clamped for approx. 10-15 minutes. Always 100% saturation here. The radial artery is then removed. This is treated with 4-0 Prolene sutures proximally and distally using a bypass ligature. Securing suture on the skin area of the flap. The flap is then lifted from caudal to cranial, taking the pedicle with it. Outgoing vessels are ligated or clipped. First clamp the interosseous artery in the elbow area. After consistently good saturation of almost 100 %, clipping or puncture ligation of this. Two outgoing cephalic veins can be seen in the elbow area. The confluence in the area of the radial artery is relatively thin and is also lifted. The flap is then removed. Ligature of the veins, treatment of the edges of the apposition in the area of the brachial artery using 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Flushing of the flap with heparin solution. Split skin is removed from the thigh. This is successively incorporated into the defect on the left forearm. Skin is closed cranially in a typical layered fashion. Subsequent application of octenidine and Mepilex as well as small clouds. Fixation with absorbent cotton. Then fitting of a Cramer splint and fixation of the hand using an elastic bandage. Subsequent application of the hand. Saturation always at 97-100 %, no special features. Then suturing of the radial flap into the defect: This is successively sutured into the defect, which extends from the palatal arch to the base of the tongue or hypopharyngeal entrance. Suturing using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures, partly under a template. Suturing is complete and tension-free. Then anastomosis of the vessels of the flap. Selection of 2 outlets from the facial vein area. The facial artery is selected for the arterial anastomosis. The facial artery is sutured to the radial artery after conditioning with 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial pulse, good venous return, no special features. Subsequent anastomosis of an outlet of the cephalic vein with an outlet from the facial vein using a 3-0 coupler. Again, good venous return after opening the clamp. Positive smear phenomenon. Subsequently, a 2nd outlet from the facial vein is anastomosed with the 2nd outlet from the cephalic vein with a 3.5 mm coupler. No special features here either. Smear phenomenon more positive. Good reflux after opening the clamp. Another small vein is clipped in the area of the flap pedicle. Subsequently, careful positioning of the flap pedicle to prevent kinking. Careful hemostasis is then performed again. Irrigation of the wound area, wound closure in layers on the right side with insertion of 2 flaps. A skin suture is placed in the area of the flap pedicle for Doppler control. On the left side, the skin is closed in the typical layered fashion with the insertion of a Redon drain. The cannula was suture-fixed after insertion. Check of the endaural flap, this is inconspicuously regular. A hydrogel dressing was applied to the thigh area. The procedure was completed without complications. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit postoperatively on mechanical ventilation. Please continue antibiotic treatment, which was started intraoperatively with Unacid 3 g, for a total of 1 week. Nutrition for 10 days via inserted PEG or already inserted PEG tube. Then swallow gruel and if necessary build up the diet. Flap control typically for 5 days by means of Doppler control, but above all clinically transorally. Please run heparin perfusor 500 E/h for 5 days. Overall cT2-3 tonsillar carcinoma, which infiltrated the wall deeply and therefore required flap coverage. Waiting for histology in the area of the cervical lymph nodes, then presentation at the tumor conference.","Tumor resection, Neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy creation

Taking into account the corresponding imaging and the panendoscopic findings, the above-mentioned procedure was indicated with flap coverage. Patient informed about flap coverage, the plan was to remove the radial lobe on the left with a negative Allen test on both sides.","First intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again, the tumor is seen growing on the left side pointedly in the direction of the vallecula and lower base of the tongue and as described in the direction of the supraglottic left, including the medial and lateral parts of the arytenoid fold. The upper parts of the hypopharynx on the left medial side are then also included laterally. Right piriform sinus free. Ingrowth into the pre-epiglottic soft tissues probable. Confirmation of the above-mentioned surgical indication. Initially PEG placement after suture insertion. With very good diaphanoscopy, this is successful without any problems. Repeated check of the Allen test. Even after several attempts, the Allen test on the left is positive. Therefore, Allen test on the right, which proves to be correct. Therefore no flap elevation of the radialis flap on the left, but on the right side. This is followed by skin disinfection of all relevant areas. Inject 10 ml into each side of the neck. Sterile draping of all relevant surgical areas. Start with elevation of the apron flap and neck dissection on both sides: (<CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME>). Elevation of the apron flap by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> in the usual manner until the submandibular gland and hyoid are exposed. Neck dissectio Regio II to V left through <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Exposure of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Locate and protect the accessorius nerve. Tracing of the omohyoid muscle and the posterior digastric muscle. Exposure of the gl. submandibularis while preserving the facial vein. Retrograde dissection of the jugulofacial angle and exposure of the jugular vascular sheath. Exposure of the internal jugular vein and the ACC as well as the ACI/ACE and identification of the vagus nerve. This can also be preserved. Exposure and preservation of the plexus branches. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve. Clearing of regions II-V on the left side. Final dissection medial to the ACC and start of release of the larynx and transfer to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Right: Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Locating and protecting the accessorius nerve. Tracing of the omohyoid muscle and the posterior digastric muscle. Exposure of the gl. submandibularis while preserving the facial vein. Retrograde dissection of the jugulofacial angle and exposure of the jugular vascular sheath. Exposure of the internal jugular vein and the ACC as well as the ACI/ACE and identification of the vagus nerve. This can also be preserved. Exposure and preservation of the plexus branches. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve. There are suspicious lymph nodes in region II a and b on the right. These regions are successively removed. Regions III-V on the right side are also removed. A larger, deep-seated arterial vessel is ligated. Now dissection medial to the ACC and start to release the larynx. Subsequent tumor resection with laryngectomy, partial resection of the base of the tongue and partial resection of the pharynx on the left: First detachment of the suprahyoid musculature and the infrahyoid musculature from the hyoid bone. However, part of the suprahyoid musculature is left in place and included in the preparation. This is mainly central. Dissection of the soft tissues up to the supraglottic level is initially omitted. Instead, the infrahyoid musculature is separated and cut caudally. The lymph node fatty tissue of level VI was also dissected and also sent in as a specimen. Caudal transection of the thyroid isthmus. Ligation using stitching sutures. Lateral dissection. Opening of the trachea in the 1st/2nd interspace and then intubation. Insertion of a laryngectomy tube. The caudal trachea is fixed to the skin with 2 sutures. Then expose the superior cornu on both sides. Separation of the constrictor pharyngis from the cartilaginous skeleton. Dissect the piriform sinus more on the right than on the left. Then enter the pharynx on the right at the level of the epiglottis. Exposure of the tumor. Cut around the tumor macroscopically on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm. The vallecula initially falls cranially. However, there is still some induration in the vallecula area. Therefore, an approx. 2-3 cm wide strip of mucosa with attached soft tissue is resected from the pharyngeal margin on the right over the base of the tongue to the pharyngeal margin on the left. The sutures are placed close to the tumor and the specimen should be examined away from the tumor. The larynx is developed further caudally while protecting the pharyngeal mucosa as much as possible. Dissection of the distal hypopharyngeal and esophageal entrance. Subsequent removal of the larynx, whereby the trachea is preserved up to the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage in a tongue for suturing. In the cranial pharyngeal region, a marginal sample several mm thick is taken from both the right and left side up to half of the pharynx caudally. These, as well as the entire specimen, are thread-marked for the frozen section margin examination. No evidence of tumor infiltrates in the frozen section in any of the marginal samples. Thus R0 situation. Careful hemostasis and irrigation. Subsequent insertion of a size 10 Provox prosthesis in the typical manner. Then myotomy, whereby the muscles of the constrictor pharyngis are severed on the left side. This significantly improves passage in the esophageal opening. Then elevation of the radial lobe: (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): After rechecking the negative Allen test on the right side, draw in the landmarks. Skin incision and dissection of the subcutaneous fatty tissue. This is very thin, so care is taken to leave enough subcutaneous fatty tissue on the skin to avoid necrosis. Dissection of the cephalic vein and exploration of the venous star. Expose and expose the pedicle. Cut around the ulnar side of the 8x8cm flap according to the frozen section result. Palpation of the ulnar artery in depth. Incision of the radial side and radial dissection of the cephalic vein in order to integrate it into the flap. Locate the radial artery distally. Preservation of both branches of the superficial radial nerve. Placement of the graft and irrigation with heparin. At the same time, large areas of split skin are removed from the right thigh in the usual manner. Application of sterile wound dressing in the area of the donor site. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm and suturing of the split skin with relief incisions. Application of a sterile wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Subsequent placement of the right arm. Then insertion of the flap into the defect and vascular anastomosis. Flap is successively sutured into the defect without tension using 4-0 Vicryl single-button sutures. Flap pedicle is transferred to the right side of the neck. Conditioning of the radial artery and a large cephalic vein as well as a small radial vein. Conditioning of the facial vein and a small thyroid vein as well as the facial artery, which is dissected. The facial artery is first anastomosed using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. Then anastomosis of the cephalic vein with an outlet of the facial vein using a 3.0 coupler. Then anastomosis of the small V. radialis with the small V. thyroidea media using coupler 1.5. In each case after opening the clamps, good return flow, positive smear phenomenon. Attempt to fix a Doppler flow system to the vein, which was not successful despite several attempts, as the signal was too uncertain. The ultrasound probe is then discarded. Stem is adjusted to prevent kinking. Irrigation of the entire area and careful hemostasis. Subsequent layer-by-layer wound closure with placement of 2 flaps on the right and a Redon drainage on the left and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Subsequently insertion of a 10 mm tracheostomy tube. The procedure was completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Here, please monitor the flap closely clinically by inspecting the flap via the pharynx or by Doppler sonography at the marked site for 5 days. Please continue antibiotics that were started intraoperatively for one week. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube. On the 10th to 12th day, swallow porridge and then build up the diet if necessary. Overall cT4a supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma with infiltration of the vallecula and caudal base of the tongue as well as part of the medial hypopharynx on the left. Suspicious lymph nodes on both sides. Please present postoperatively after receiving the final histology in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","TU resection, Laryngectomy, Flap coverage, Free flap (Radial), PEG, Tracheostomy, and Provox placement

The decision was therefore made to proceed primarily with transcervical tumor resection. Therefore, in the case of left-sided tumor growth, first turn to neck dissection on the right side: For this purpose, submandibular skin incision with the option of extending a Gluck Sörensen incision. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle. This shows a very pronounced anterior jugular vein. This is dissected and preserved. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid. Exposure of the submandibular gland, exposure of the digastric muscle. Complete and expose the digastric muscle up to the hyoid. Exposure and preservation of the facial vein. Expose the entire length of the digastric muscle. Now continue dissection of the anterior neck preparation. Expose the cervical artery. Expose the superior thyroid artery. Free preparation to maximum length. Preservation of the cervical artery. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Now expose the accessorius nerve. Free dissection of the internal jugular vein. Level Va now shows several nodes up to about 1 1/2 cm. Careful clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Trace the cervical sinus retrograde via the internal jugular vein and dissect level Va, carefully protecting the cervical plexus. Now remove the digastric muscle. Expose the hyoid horn - release and separate with scissors to widen the access. Now enter latero-cranially of the hyoid horn and perform the pharyngotomy. Widen the pharyngotomy. The extent of the tumor can now be easily palpated. Large parts of the tumor are submucosal. The tumor infiltrates at least 2/3 of the base of the tongue, extends on the left side to the pharyngeal wall, is exulcerated in the area of the vallecula, which is completely consumed. The vallecula is infiltrated and perforated from lingual to laryngeal. Now successive dissection of the tumor, including at least 2/3 of the base of the tongue. Inclusion of the pre-epiglottic fat, which is inconspicuous. Complete release of the epiglottis up to the petiolus. Resection of the left-sided tumor up to the pharyngeal side wall. The tumor ends at the glossotonsillar groove. Cranial macroscopic removal in sano. The specimen is now sent to frozen section diagnostics with the entire specimen thread-marked and is all found to be R0. Only in the area of the base of the tongue on the left is there a maximum basal distance of 0.1 cm. A resection and a final marginal sample are performed here. Now turn to the neck dissection on the opposite side: Here, too, a submandibular skin incision is made. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Level II shows a pronounced conglomerate of metastases which, after exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, clearly infiltrates the muscle and also reaches close to the mandible. Now first expose the borders. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid. A pronounced anterior jugular vein is also well preserved here. Removal of the anterior preparation, the superior thyroid artery can be preserved. Further dissection clearly shows that the lymph node conglomerate in the area of the venous angle clearly infiltrates the internal jugular vein. Therefore, expose the internal jugular vein caudally. Separation of the internal jugular vein and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cranial en bloc dissection including level Va. Careful protection of the carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Cranially, the lingual artery and occipital artery must be removed in the area of the external carotid artery after ligation. Involvement of the hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. Cranially, the mass extends close to the mandibular branch. Branches from the oral branch clearly extend into the tumor and are deposited. Here the conglomerate does not reach the submandibular gland. This is skeletonized and left in place. The defect to the pharynx is now visible at the level of the resected hypoglossal nerve. Removal of the internal jugular vein cranially. Parallel to this, elevation of an antero-lateral thigh flap - at the patient's request from the left. A defect measuring a good 7 x 6 cm had already been previously ............. Determination of the perforator line and doppler sonographic identification of 2 equally strong perforators in the midline area. Marking of the graft. Medial skin incision. Separation of the subcutaneous tissue and identification of the rectus femoris muscle. Strictly subfascial dissection. Expansion of the muscle fascia and exposure of the vascular pedicle. Blunt dissection to expose the vascular pedicle in its course. It can now be seen that one perforator runs purely fasciocutaneous, a second one myocutaneous. Performing the relief incision and further dissection and visualization of the vascular pedicle. This is relatively narrow with a clear resection of the base of the tongue. Now subtotal entrainment of the vastus lateralis, entrainment of the muscle while carefully preserving the perforator plane. This is successful with good perforator visibility and in the slim patient. Now dissect the vascular pedicle. Very small caliber vessels can now be seen. Laborious dissection and tracing of the vessels. Exposure of the outlets towards the rectus femoris and transverse outlets towards the vastus lateralis. Slight increase in the caliber of the artery so that it can later be deposited shortly before the outflow of the vessels mentioned. Further dissection of the accompanying veins. Very laborious dissection and hardly any increase in caliber. Several potential veins are now removed and elevated. Prior to this, regular flap control and, if blood flow is good, removal of the graft. Finally, if the site is free of bleeding, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure after removal of excess skin. Now suture the graft with the aid of sutures. The pharyngeal wall on the left and the entire base of the tongue and the resected supraglottic structures are now reconstructed as a patchplasty. Partially laborious suturing with deliberately sparing pharyngotomy and clearly pronounced muscle cuff. Finally, good graft fit. Microscopic dissection of the vessels. It shows the superior thyroid artery after free preparation in the appropriate caliber size for the flap artery. Due to the position of the planned arterial anastomosis, the decision was made to anastomize the vein with the facial vein. Free preparation of the facial vein with maximum length gain. Performing the arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. This works well. Placement of a final suture after reopening the Acland clamp. Regular flow with tight conditions and immediate regular venous return. One venous vessel now has a clear advantage in terms of reflux. Tilt the remaining veins and, after removing the facial vein and exposing the vessel, pass the anastomosis with a size 2.5 coupler. After reopening the Acland clamps, regular flow with immediately good venous return. Padding of the anastomosis with a piece of fat and careful, two-layer wound closure with insertion of a flap. Doppler sonographic identification of the flap pedicle and suture marking. Parallel to this, with dry wound conditions, closure of the left side of the neck after insertion of a 10 Redon drainage with two-layer wound closure. Performing a plastic tracheotomy: Horizontal skin incision for this. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and expose the infrahyoid musculature. Dissecting the musculature, exposing the thyroid isthmus. Bipolar coagulation of the less pronounced isthmus. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea and the cricoid cartilage. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp. Creation of a broad-based, pedicled Björk flap and insertion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequent problem-free transfer to an 8-gauge cannula with inner core and completion of the procedure at this point. Conclusion: cT4a cN2b-cN2c left vallecular carcinoma with subtotal tongue base resection and epiglottis resection. Intraoperative macroscopic and microscopic R0. Due to the extensive resection of the base of the tongue and the epiglottis resection, the prognosis and swallowing function should be viewed with caution. Prolonged swallowing rehabilitation in any case. If possible, the cannula should be left in place for at least 5 days postoperatively. Regular Doppler sonography and endoscopic checks as usual.","TU resection with subtotal ZGru (zygomaticus groove) resection, Epiglottis and pharyngeal partial resection, Defect coverage, Free flap (ALT), Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy

Sterile washing and draping. First perform the tracheostomy. Re-intubation of the patient. This is followed by transoral tumor resection. The entire soft palate is removed. Resection begins at the middle tonsil pole on the right side and extends over the soft palate to the opposite side up to the lower tonsil pole. The tumor is not easily visible macroscopically. After removal of the resectate, the complete resectate is sent for frozen section histology. Carcinoma extensions are still found on the left side paramedian, therefore resection on the left side, starting from the paramedian in the area of the posterior palatal arch. These proved to be free of tumor on frozen section histology. Furthermore, an additional marginal incision is made from the anterior resection margin starting in the middle to the left. This is also free of tumor on frozen section histology, so that an R0 resection can be assumed overall. Subsequently, a radial lobe graft measuring 4 x 9 cm was measured and prepared by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Elevation of the radial forearm flap: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (9 x 4 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Dissection of a spindle-shaped skin flap from the skin of the proximal forearm, thinning of the skin and suturing in the usual manner to cover the defect on the distal forearm. Application of a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Now perform the neck dissection on the right side. After skin incision and preparation of the cervical vascular nerve sheath, regions II to IV are cleared out while sparing all non-lymphatic structures. Insertion of a Redon suction drain and two-layer wound closure. Transition to neck dissection on the opposite side. In principle, the same procedure is used here. Macroscopically, there is no evidence of lymph node metastasis on either side. Subsequent skeletonization of the hypoglossal nerve and the lingual artery, which will later be used for anastomosis. Creation of the breakthrough into the oropharynx in the lower left tonsil bed. After removal of the radial artery flap graft, it is inserted through the defect into the pharynx and sutured in place The flap is doubled in the middle. The arterial anastomosis of the strong forearm artery on the lingual artery is then performed on the right side. The venous anastomoses are two pieces in an end-to-side manner to the internal jugular vein. Finally, insertion of a Redon suction drain and a drainage flap in the usual manner. Two-layer wound closure. End of the operation, transfer of the patient to anesthesia after placement of a transverse gastric tube, the correct position of which is confirmed by auscultation. Conclusion: Transoral soft palate resection for soft palate carcinoma with primary reconstruction of the microvascular anasatomized radial flap graft from the left forearm. Covering of the defect on the left forearm with full-thickness skin from the same side of the forearm, arterial anastomosis to the lingual artery and two end-to-side veins to the internal jugular vein.

Now they tMonths feeling of pressure on the left side of the tongue. CT scan shows a contrast-absorbing mass on the left edge of the tongue.,"Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: After appropriate preparation, first disinfect the skin. Infiltration with local anesthetic containing adrenaline in the area of the subsequent skin incision. First perform the tracheoscopy. After skin incision, dissection in the median plane through the linea alba onto the isthmus, which is passed underneath. The isthmus is then ligated so that the first 5 tracheal clips can be visualized. Subsequently, visual tracheostomy between the 3rd/4th tracheal clasp with reintubation of the patient. Completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis with 2 sutures each cranially and caudally. Subsequent reintubation of the patient. Now adjust the tumor with the 2nd mouth retractor. Tightening of the tip of the tongue. The tumor is palpable in the posterior quarter of the tongue on the left side in the area of the glossotonsillar groove. Start with dorsal tumor resection, whereby the resection incision is made in the upper third of the tonsil bed and is initially made laterally up to the lower jaw. The tumor area is then resected by palpation at a distance of 1-2 cm towards the front and middle. Thus, under constant palpatory control and at an appropriate safety distance, the tumor is successively separated from the body of the tongue, initially the lateral floor of the mouth, as well as the base of the tongue using the ultrasonic knife. The hypoglossal nerve and the lingual nerve are severed. Finally, the tumor-bearing tissue block can be removed in toto. Macroscopically, the tumor is surrounded on all sides by musculature. Removal of marginal incisions circularly around the defect as well as from the tumor base. These all proved to be tumor-free, only the back of the tongue and the anterior floor of the mouth showed moderate dysplasia, so that resections were carried out here, but these were free of further dysplasia. These areas were also previously furthest away from the tumor, so there is certainly no connection with the tumor here. The main specimen is also examined using frozen section histology and is also found to be R0 in depth into the musculature. Subsequent sterile washing and draping. Transition to neck dissection on the left. After skin incision, regions II to V are successively removed while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. Then evacuation of regions Ia and b and removal of the submandibular gland, with automatic access to the oropharynx. Dissection of the digastric muscle. Dissection of the facial vein as well as a vein located further caudally for subsequent anastomosis. The superior thyroid artery is also dissected, but its caliber is quite small. Therefore, the facial artery is also dissected up to the mandible for later anastomosis. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Acceptance of the operation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Marking of the graft on the forearm 10.5 x 6.5 cm, which was measured by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Start with the flap elevation on the left forearm using <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Expose the brachioradialis muscle for this. Exposure of the cephalic vein. Visualization of the venous star in the antecubital fossa. Exposure of the confluence. Incision of the graft. Exposure of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Exposure of the radial artery, resulting in tearing of a branch from the superficial ramus of the radial nerve that runs to the thumb. This is sutured with 8.0 Prolene. Lifting of the graft from the tendon bed. Dissection of the pedicle up to the crook of the elbow. Removal of the pedicle with two superficial and two deep veins and flushing of the graft with heparin in the usual manner. Removal of full-thickness skin directly from the forearm and thinning of this full-thickness skin. Then preparation of the wound bed on the forearm by approximating the wound edges in the graft harvesting area. Then suturing of the full-thickness skin in the usual manner and turning to the oropharynx and the oral cavity. Inspection of the site again. Hemostasis. It is now clear that the defect is larger than expected and extends to the vallecula in the caudal region. This defect was partially primarily adapted here by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and the soft palate was also partially closed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, in which a part of the healthy side including the uvula was sutured to the left. In the caudal area where the partial primary wound closure in the pharynx took place, a second suture was applied to close the area more tightly. Now insert the flap and start suturing. This is relatively difficult as the graft is quite small for the large defect. In the end, the graft was successfully sutured into place. The stalk was removed into the neck. Then anastomosis between the radial artery and facial artery and anastomosis of the veins through two couplers at the outlets of the internal jugular vein. Insertion of a Penrose drain and two-layer wound closure. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue flap checks according to the usual schedule and antibiotics for at least 24 hours.  ","Transoral TU resection, Left neck dissection, Tracheotomy

Enter with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Problem-free pre-scanning into the stomach. If the diaphansocopy is very good, puncture the stomach without any problems and pull the PEG tube through using the usual suture pull-through method. Inconspicuous esophagus on reflection. Then turn to enoral tumor resection: inspection. The entire left tonsil is found to be tumorously bulging submucosally, the tumor extends close to the uvula, infiltrates the soft palate and extends up to about 1/3 of the posterior pharyngeal wall. The tumor extends towards the buccal and alveolar ridge as well as to the pharyngeal side wall at the level of the hypopharyngeal entrance, transition to the glossotonsillar groove. Contrary to the CT image, the base of the tongue itself is not infiltrated. Now cut around the tumor with the monopolar with a safety margin of at least 1 cm in case of growth into the left uvula base. Subtotal resection of the soft palate. Dissection shows that the tumor has a kind of pseudocapsule and appears relatively well encapsulated. Further excision of the tumor with sufficient safety distance using the dissection technique. Resection close to the alveolar ridge in the posterior region of the molars. All-round removal of the tumor macroscopically in healthy tissue. The carotid artery can be palpated in depth, but no direct contact. In the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, a good displacement layer is already visible above the deep cervical fascia. The tumor can be released in its entirety here. Resection of the right posterior pharyngeal wall via the midline. Resection circumscribed in the area of the glossotonsillar groove, as described above, no infiltration of the base of the tongue. The tumor specimen is thread-marked for final histology. Clearly representative marginal samples are now taken in the entire adjacent mucosal area as well as basally in the area of the upper tonsil pole and in the area of the pharyngeal musculature. Macroscopic resection is most likely here. In frozen section diagnostics, all marginal samples are found to be tumor-free. The result is a subtotal soft palate defect with a defect in the posterior pharyngeal wall extending beyond the midline and to the lateral pharyngeal wall in the area of the transition to the hypopharynx. In addition, circumscribed resection of the glossotonsillar groove and the posterior floor of the mouth. Resection of the right tonsil using the dissection technique, meticulous hemostasis. A defect measuring a maximum of 11 x 7 cm is now measured and an appropriately configured radialis graft is designed. From here, parallel preparation of the neck dissection and the radial distal graft. First for the neck dissection - start with the right side: make a submandibular curved incision. Cut through the skin and the subcutis. Exposure of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma. Creation of a platysmal flap. Exposure of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Sparing of the structures. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Free preparation of the muscle and exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Freeing of the muscle up to the hyoid. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Complete the anterior direction of the hyoid. Expose the entire length of the digaster muscle. Now continue exposing the neck preparation anteriorly. Expose the cervical anus. Expose and preserve the facial vein, expose the hypoglossal nerve and the superior thyroid artery. Now dissect dorsally. Release the accessorius triangle while carefully preserving the nerve and complete level Va while carefully preserving the cervical plexus. Final inspection and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. All the anatomical structures mentioned here were preserved. Now turning to the opposite side: Here, the same procedure was followed in principle. After creating a platysmal flap, expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric nerve. During dissection of the internal jugular vein, several tributaries to the internal jugular vein are visible here (as well as on the opposite side) in addition to the facial vein. These are all spared. In the area of the jugulo-facial angle, a lymph node of conspicuous size and shape is now visible on the left. Release the specimen anteriorly while also sparing and exposing the hypoglossal nerve, cervical artery and superior thyroid artery. Complete the neck dorsally while carefully protecting the accessorius nerve and the cervical plexus. Now remove the digastric muscle. Further dissection and performance of a pharyngotomy below the tonsil lobe. Creation of an approx. 3-finger wide access. Radialis graft: First identify the cephalic vein. Marking of the graft. A skin monitor is also lifted. Application of the tourniquet to 300 mmHg. Skin incision and preparation of a skin flap while carefully preserving the subcutaneous vascular tissue. Exposure of the cephalic vein. Strictly subfascial dissection and performance of the Hayden maneuver. Identification of the superficial ramus and radial nerve. Both branches can be exposed and preserved. Now expose the vascular pedicle. Blunt exposure of the radial artery with its accompanying veins. Ligation of the vascular pedicle. Now successive lifting of the graft under strictly subfascial preparation. Develop the graft cranially while carefully supplying the feeding vessels. A classic vein pattern with cubital outlet of the cephalic vein can be seen in the area of the antecubital fossa. In the area of the cubital fossa, the anatomy is also classic with a regular outlet of the interosseous artery and the ulnar artery. A broad vascular bridge of the deep venous area of the radial artery and the superficial outflow area can now also be seen. Now open the tourniquet. Minutious hemostasis. Regular or excellent flap perfusion with regular arm perfusion. Deposition of the graft after ligation of the remaining draining and supplying vessels. Then removal of full-thickness skin from the right groin. Skin incision for this. Strict cutaneous preparation. Careful hemostasis and, after skin mobilization, careful, multi-layered subcutaneous closure with moderate tension and skin suturing. Prior to this, insertion of a 10 Redon drain. Now inspection of the forearm. Final hemostasis and, if the wound is dry, careful two-layer wound closure and insertion of the full-thickness skin graft and final treatment with a vacuum sealing dressing and application of the Cramer splint. Now to the suturing of the graft. Start suturing the graft transorally. First suturing of the dorsal resection border, suturing of the palatal arch replacement in the area of the tonsil lobe, especially in the area of the transition to the glossotonsillar groove and the posterior floor of the mouth. Extremely difficult suturing conditions, also in the area of the pharyngeal side wall. Difficult suturing due to poor accessibility, but finally a tight and gap-free fit. The caudal end of the flap must be sutured in transcervically. Here, after exposing the pharyngotomy, relatively problem-free suturing. Here too, good adaptation with an overall adequate flap size. Now turn to the vascular anastomosis. The superior thyroid artery is further exposed, clamped and dissected free. Vascular anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. Slightly more difficult due to the position of the vessel, but overall without complications. After opening the clamp, good and tight vascular anastomosis with good flow and good venous return. Now select the venous vessel with the better return flow. Clip the 2nd vein. Measure a 2.5 mm coupler. Expose and carefully dissect the facial venous branch. Deposition after clipping and coupler anastomosis. In this case, the posterior part of the coupler cannot be placed correctly so that a sufficient anastomosis cannot be created. The coupler must therefore be removed. At the next attempt, coupler placement without complications, also with 2.5 mm density and sufficient anastomosis with good arterial and venous flow. Regular blood supply to the skin monitor, so that after flap application, the wound was carefully closed in two layers in dry wound conditions. A tracheotomy had already been performed previously due to the size of the defect, the size of the flap and the tongue swelling that occurred during the incision. For this purpose, the skin incision was made horizontally, sparingly below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Splitting of the musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea and insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a Björk flap and performance of the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Finally, problem-free reintubation to an 8-gauge cannula with inner core and completion of the procedure, overall without any indication of complications. Conclusion: R0 resection of a cT3 cN1 tonsillar carcinoma on the left. The antibiotic treatment with Unacid 3 g started intraoperatively should be continued for at least 24 hours. The sutured cannula should be left in place until the 5th postoperative day. Leave the Cramer splint and Vac bandage in place for 7 days. A diet can be started from the 8th postoperative day if the flap is healing well.

Sonographically, there was evidence of a cN2a neck status. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment with laryngectomy was recommended. After extensive consultations, a joint decision was made with the patient on primary surgical treatment.","After induction of anesthesia and preparation of the patient by the anesthesia colleagues, the patient is first positioned. Entry with the small bore tube under dental protection to inspect the primary tumor region. The base of the tongue, vallecula and epiglottis are clear. The tumorous mass begins in the area of the aryepiglottic fold on the left, extends to the ary, infiltrates it and moves over the pocket fold to the left vocal fold, extends there to the anterior commissure, growth over the medial wall of the piriform sinus to the anterior wall here and tumorous fixation of the piriform sinus to the hemilarynx. The lateral wall of the piriform sinus, the posterior wall of the hypopharynx and the entire right side are tumor-free, as are the postcricoid region and the esophageal entrance. Insertion of a nasogastric tube under visualization. Repositioning of the patient and injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. Skin incision to perform an apron flap. Cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. High dissection of the platysma and high suture of the apron flap. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle on both sides. Exposure and free preparation of the hyoid. Subsequent dissection of the infrahyoid musculature from the hyoid. Skeletonization of the larynx. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage horns. On the left side, the tumor can already be palpated endolaryngeally in this area and therefore a tissue sleeve is left here. Complete skeletonization on the right side. Release of the piriform sinus. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Separation of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Laryngoscopy showed no evidence of subglottic expansion, therefore tracheotomy was performed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring and later intubation was changed to an LE tube. With the vallecula and epiglottis free, the tube is now inserted below the hyoid and centrally into the vallecula, followed by the epiglottis. Resection along the right aryepiglottic folds and thus extension of the pharyngotomy. Now a good overview of the tumor. This is as described above. Triggering of the right piriform sinus. Resection postcricoid. Here on the left side of the postcricoid ary widening of the safety margin with superficial whitish changes. Partial resection of the left piriform sinus while maintaining a safety distance of approx. 1.5 cm from the tumor here. Safe in sano conditions on all sides towards the depth with overlying soft tissue mantle. After resection of the tumor, preparation strictly close to the cartilage. Release the esophagus and place the larynx at the level of the tracheotomy. Careful inspection. ............... A somewhat narrow area can be seen in the area of the pharyngeal side wall, otherwise wide on the right side. No extension towards the subglottic area. A post-resection is now performed in the area of the scarce deposit in the area of the pharyngeal side wall, which generously covers the described part. Subsequently, left-sided and postcricoid specimens are taken from the margins, completely mapping the tumor. These were found to be free of tumor and dysplasia in the frozen section diagnosis. Therefore, the overall situation here is R0. The neck dissections are now performed. Start with the right side. This shows a markedly strong jugular vein.... ........ or a divided internal jugular vein. A strong portion lies in front of the omohyoid muscle. Dissection of the vein. It can be seen that the very, very strong vein rejoins the internal jugular vein below the omohyoid muscle and also flows back into it cranially. Leave the vascular variation. Free preparation of the veins. Clearing of level V a with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Here several nodes are not necessarily macroscopically suspicious. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Release of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with exposure of the common carotid artery, preservation of the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Overall, there were no compelling suspicious nodules. Careful wound inspection and turning to the opposite side if the wound is dry. A clinically clear metastasis measuring approx. 5 cm is seen at the transition from level III to IV. Caudal dissection of the internal jugular vein. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation while preserving the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. The metastasis extends medially to the common carotid artery and prevertebral fascia, but can be easily detached without any signs of infiltration and regular release of the hypoglossal nerve. Careful dissection of the internal jugular vein. Here it is noticeable that an area of approx. 2 cm is clearly infiltrated at the free edge and therefore caudal separation of the internal jugular vein. Laterally, there is no clear infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, but there is clear adherence here. Therefore, a muscle cuff is taken and left on the node. Take level V a with careful protection of the caudal lymph vessels. Caudal ligation when moving towards level V b. Before removing the vein, secure and follow the vagus nerve. This is safely free. Cranially, the accessorius nerve can be exposed and preserved. Clear the accessorius triangle with careful protection. Leave the inflow of the facial vein caudally and remove the anterior jugular vein cranial to the metastasis and remove the neck preparation. The cervical plexus was also preserved. Careful wound inspection and, if the wound was dry, insertion of an 8 mm Provox prosthesis. Placement in the usual manner using the pull-through method at the cranial edge of the tracheal insertion margin. The paramedian myotomy in the area of the upper esophageal sphincter had already been performed previously. This results in wide ratios. Later, the sternal insertions of the sternocleidomastoid muscle are also removed. Subsequently, if the mucosal conditions are strong and sufficient, the initially submucosal, inverting mucosal suture is used to close the pharynx. Overall two-layer closure. Subsequent readaptation of the released infrahyoid muscles to the hyoid. Subsequent final wound inspection and, if conditions are dry and the wound is irrigated, insertion of 2 10-gauge Redon drains and careful, two-layer wound closure with circular suturing of the tracheostoma without increased tension. The patient was given intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g. This should be continued for 24 hours postoperatively. Please continue this for 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT3 cN2a supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma on the left. With clinically normal wound healing, postoperative X-ray gruel swallow on the 10th postoperative day please. Presentation at our interdisciplinary tumor conference for adjuvant therapy, which will certainly be necessary.  ","Laryngectomy with Partial pharyngectomy, Neck dissection

Inconspicuous mucosal conditions can be seen here. Inversion without any problems. After safe diaphanoscopy, PEG placement is performed in the typical manner using the thread pull-through method. Pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The well-known tumor measuring approx. 2 x 3 cm can be seen in the area of the tonsil on the left side. On the right side in the area of the uvula as well as the posterior pharyngeal wall, the piriform sinus on both sides, the esophageal entrance and the entire endolarynx, the mucosal conditions are unremarkable. No evidence of exophytic tumor growth. Enoral tumor resection: insertion of the Mc Ivor blade. Establish the resection margins with sufficient safety distance using the electric needle. Successive release of the tumor under visual control. Careful hemostasis with the bipolar. The resection covers the entire tonsil on the left side and extends into the base of the tongue and onto the posterior pharyngeal wall. The preparation is then marked with a suture and sent for a frozen section. Insertion of two hydrogen compresses and repositioning for neck dissection on the right side. Skin disinfection and local anesthesia. Approx. 15 cm long curved skin incision in the area of the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Separation of the subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the platysma. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection of the medial part of the muscle. Exposure of the digastricus venter posterior muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Then expose the accessorius nerve and the internal jugular vein. The internal jugular vein is now successively exposed. Then explore the anterior galenic muscle in the caudal region. Now successively dissect the neck preparation caudally with careful bipolar coagulation. Then dissect and clear the accessorius triangle. Release the lateral neck preparation from cranial to caudal while protecting the plexus branches. Then careful hemostasis with the bipolar. Now dissect the facial vein and the submandibular gland. Then evacuation of the venous angle with exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. The capsule of the submandibular gland is also removed in the caudal part. Finally, the caudal part of the medial neck preparation is removed. This allows the cervical anus to be spared. Then rinse with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Careful hemostasis. Insertion of a 10 mm Redon drain. Cutaneous suture. Skin suture. After obtaining the frozen section, the patient is repositioned again. The frozen section shows a carcinoma in situ in the area of the median margin. The decision is therefore made to resect. The electric needle is now used to carefully resect again. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Insertion of two hydrogen swabs. The specimen is sent for final histology. Finally, no cervical structures are exposed in the area of the oral cavity. Now repositioning for neck dissection on the left side: skin disinfection. Local anesthesia. Renewed, approx. 15 cm long curved skin incision in the area of the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and exposure of the muscle in its median portion. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the posterior digastric muscle. An extensive, firmly attached lymph node bundle is now visible in the area of level II, which appears to be directly adjacent to the accessorius nerve and the internal jugular vein. The accessorius nerve is shown in its caudal course. The internal jugular vein is also dissected in its caudal course. The anterior scalene muscle is now explored in the caudal region. The internal jugular vein is now dissected from caudal to cranial. The neck preparation is then placed in the caudal region. This is done with careful bipolar coagulation. The thoracic duct is not exposed. The facial vein is then exposed in the cranial region and the venous angle is dissected. The hypoglossal nerve is successfully exposed. Then, with great difficulty, the lymph node conglomerate is detached from the internal jugular vein and the venous angle is dissected. The accessorius nerve is now dissected further cranially. This results in the opening of an apparently necrotic, disintegrating lymph node. The escaping fluid is suctioned out with the aspirator. The lymph node conglomerate is then removed while sparing the accessorius nerve. Now there is a much better overview. The entire course of the accessory nerve can now be visualized. The accessorius triangle is then evacuated. This is done with careful hemostasis. Further suspicious lymph nodes are also clinically present here. These are now successively removed. Expose the internal jugular vein in its entire course from caudal to cranial. Subsequently, successive dissection of the lateral neck preparation and removal of the same with careful hemostasis. Due to the adhesions in the cranial area, some smaller branches of the cervical plexus are also resected. The cervical plexus itself can be preserved. The caudal medial neck preparation is then removed while sparing the cervical nerve. In addition, removal of the caudal part of the capsule of the submandibular gland. Careful hemostasis and irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Subcutaneous suture. Skin suture. Now reposition again for endoral inspection: the inserted hydrogen swabs are now removed. Careful hemostasis again with the bipolar. The operation is then completed without bleeding or complications. Conclusion: Enormous tumor resection of a T2 tonsillar carcinoma on the left. First CIS in the median part in the frozen section, therefore decision to resect. Problem-free PEG placement. Neck dissection on both sides, levels 1b to 5, with clinically suspicious lymph nodes on the left side in levels 1b, 2 and 3.","Panendoscopy, PEG, Enoral tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection

The findings were confirmed by panendoscopy <2016> in domo. A CT scan of the neck and thorax with contrast medium performed by us showed no evidence of thyroid cartilage infiltration. Secondary findings included a contrast-absorbing lesion in the area of the right vallecula and in the area of the right glossotonsillar groove. Based on the findings, the above-mentioned operation was indicated. The patient was informed in detail about the procedure and had sufficient time to ask questions. He was also presented to our phoniatrics department and had a discussion with the laryngectomy association.","Transferring the patient to the operating theater . Patient identification. Carrying out the team time-out in the usual manner. Induction of intubation anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. Start of the operation with panendoscopy. Inspection of the endolarynx: a transglottic laryngeal carcinoma is found in the area of the right pocket fold and supraglottic, growing to approx. 2 cm subglottically. The tumor dominates on the right side, extending over the anterior commissure to half of the left vocal fold. Retraction of the small siphon tube and inspection of the lesions described in the CT scan in the area of the right vallecula. This shows a ruptured vallecula cyst. To rule out malignancy, samples are taken and sent for frozen section diagnostics (frozen section not malignant). Inspection of the right glossotonsillar groove: if the mucosa is normal, superficial PEs are also taken to rule out malignancy (frozen section, also non-malignant). Insertion of a nasogastric tube. Removal of the small esophageal tube and insertion of the flexible gastroesophagoscope into the esophagus and careful advancement into the stomach. Check the stomach again. The mucosa is found to be free of irritation on all sides. Insertion of a PEG tube in the usual manner using the thread pull-through method without complications. The patient is then repositioned in a head down position. Injection of xylocaine with the addition of suprarenin. Sterile abjodation and draping of the patient. Start with the tracheotomy: skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Separation of the subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the platysma. Identification of the superficial neck muscles and incision in the midline. Lateralization of the neck muscles with the retractors. Identification of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining of the isthmus with the clamp and transection of the isthmus after bipolar coagulation. Identification of the anterior wall of the trachea. Freeing the trachea from the surrounding tissue. Due to the previously described subglottic extension of the tumor, the tracheotomy is performed deep (between the 4th and 5th tracheal cartilage). Suturing at the caudal wound edge and insertion of an LE tube. Continuation of the operation with incision of the apron flap. Separation of the skin, subcutis and platysma. Subplatysmal dissection up to the exposure of the hyoid bone and the submandibular gland on both sides. Opening of the glandular capsule and detachment of the submandibular gland from the glandular bed on both sides. Identification of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side to perform the neck dissection. Neck dissection on the right by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: After identification of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, dissection down to the deep cervical fascia. In doing so, protect the plexus branches of the cervical plexus. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and free dissection. The nerve can be safely spared. Identification of the posterior venter of the digastric muscle. Identification of the omohyoid muscle and tracing of the muscle to the hyoid bone. Dissect the internal jugular vein while safely identifying and protecting the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Now detach the neck preparation from region II to IV from cranial to caudal from the deep cervical fascia while protecting the plexus branches. Minor bleeding is coagulated bipolarly. Neck dissection on the right side is successful without any problems. The same procedure is now performed on the left side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Overall, there are no macroscopically clearly suspicious lymph nodes, although the lymph nodes are clearly enlarged and enlarged on both sides. Free preparation of the hyoid bone by loosening the supra- and infrahyoid muscles. On the left side, the infrahyoid musculature is completely folded caudally. On the right side, it is cut in the midline in order to avoid dissecting into the tumor as much as possible. Removal of the hyoid bone. Release the oblique laryngeal muscles on the right and left side with careful dissection. This can be done without any problems and without any evidence of soft tissue infiltration. Now release the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage. Careful dissection of the piriform sinus from the thyroid cartilage on both sides. Enter the pharynx on the left side. Then disluxation of the epiglottis and incision of the mucosa at the edge of the epiglottis to behind the arytenoid region on both sides. Subsequent removal of the larynx below the cricoid cartilage. Removal of the larynx and collection of several representative marginal samples by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. After removal of the larynx, a Provox prosthesis is placed in the usual manner. In addition, a myotomy of the esophageal inlet is performed. The two-layer pharyngeal closure is performed in the usual manner. In addition, as much preserved muscle as possible is placed over the suture in a 3rd step. Retraction of the apron flap Incision of the tracheostoma and two-layer wound closure using subcutaneous and cutaneous sutures. Application of a wrap bandage. Please continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Nutrition via the PEG tube. The dressing must be changed daily and should be left in place for a total of 1 week.

This revealed a vocal fold completely affected from anterior to posterior up to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage with a slight extension into the morgue sinus as well as an involvement of the right vocal fold in the anterior two thirds without extension up to the parotid gland or into the subglottis. Thus, successive bypassing of the findings initially on the left side, macroscopically in healthy tissue. The arytenoid cartilage on the left side is spared but completely de-epithelialized. Subsequently, the anterior 2/3 of the right vocal fold was removed macroscopically in healthy tissue. Five marginal samples were then taken (left supraglottis, left subglottis, left arytenoid region, right supraglottis, right subglottis). All 5 marginal samples were found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleague. Hemostasis there by means of bipolar coagulation. Due to the large wound area of the de-epithelialized arytenoid cartilage and the patient's poor coagulation status, the decision was made to create a small tracheostoma and then to make another horizontal incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure and transection of the prelaryngeal musculature in the midline. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, which is supplied and severed using bipolar coagulation. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Creation of a scalpel incision between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasp. Creation of a small Björk flap in the typical manner. Tracheostoma sutures, skin sutures and placement of an 8-bore tracheostomy tube. This is successful. Repeated endolaryngeal inspection. Dry conditions. Decision to insert a 16-gauge Keel prosthesis based on the corresponding wound surfaces. This is well fixed using Vicryl 3-0 sutures after drilling holes in the thyroid cartilage. Subsequent suture adaptation of the prelaryngeal muscles of the midline. Platysma suture. Single button skin suture. Application of a pressure bandage, completion of the procedure without complications. Conclusion: Problem-free partial laryngectomy according to Huet transcervical with creation of a small plastic tracheostoma. Due to the large wound area and the patient's poor coagulation status, please administer antibiotics with Sobelin 600 4 x daily intravenously for the next 7 days and nutrition via the nasogastric feeding tube for the next 7 days and present the patient to our interdisciplinary tumor conference as soon as possible after receiving the final histology. Please plan control MLE and Keel removal in 6-8 weeks.","Partial laryngeal resection, Tracheostomy creation

The CT scan showed a mediastinal lymph node metastasis or lung metastasis. Bronchoscopy showed no evidence of malignancy, but a single round focus, which is .................. suspected of being malignant. This should be removed by thoracic surgery following surgical repair.","At the beginning of the operation, after induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues, a pharyngoscopy was performed to determine the exact extent of the tumor. An exophytic tumor was found in the area of the left tonsillar lobe, which almost filled the tonsillar lobe, but without significant involvement of the posterior pharyngeal wall or extensive transition into the soft palate. The tumor extends over the glossotonsillar groove into the base of the tongue and the edge of the tongue if the posterior floor of the mouth is intact. The edge of the tongue is clearly affected on the free lateral surface. Exulcerated tumor here. Anteriorly only the marginal area is infiltrated. The width of the tumor increases dorsally. Significant infiltration of the base of the tongue. Almost half of this is palpatorily infiltrated. Inspection of the vallecula. This is again free of tumor, as is the lateral wall of the pharynx. Palpatorily clear cervical lymph node metastasis as a conglomerate on the left. The rest of the pharynx and the endolarynx are clear. PEG tube was therefore initially inserted. Insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Problem-free pre-scanning into the stomach. After good diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual suture pull-through method. Subsequent repositioning of the patient. First start with the enoral resection. Here, the tumor is first cut around with the electric needle. Then further dissection using the dissection technique. The left edge of the tongue is released while maintaining a safety distance of approx. 1.5 cm. Resection up to the edge of the tongue. Release of the tumor and lateral displacement, additional release of the part of the tonsil region. Deposition hard on the uvula, taking the anterior palatal arch with it. Resection up to the alveolar ridge while maintaining the safety distance. Partial removal of the pharyngeal muscles. Subsequent partial exposure of the soft tissue of the neck. Macroscopically, complete in sano conditions on all sides, as well as in the area of the sedimentation margins in the area of the mucosa. Release of the glossotonsillar groove and circumscribed involvement of the posterior floor of the mouth. Here, the tumor moves slightly into the depth, also poor overview in the area of the base of the tongue, therefore no further transoral resection is performed here. The area resected so far is completely covered with margin samples and diagnosed as in sano in the frozen section diagnostics. Now reposition for neck dissection on the left. To do this, make a curved skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is partially displaced. Free preparation of the muscle. When exposing the muscle, a clear infiltration can be seen approximately in the middle of the course. Therefore, after exposing the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is exposed caudally and later cranially on the mastoid. After dissection of the borders, the internal jugular vein is now exposed. This shows that the metastasis clearly infiltrates the venous angle. Longer infiltration of the internal jugular vein and the outlet of the facial vein. Careful release of the metastasis in the area of the veins to preserve the superior thyroid vein and the cranial facial drainage. After removal of the internal jugular vein and mobilization of the metastasis, which is also partly located in the cervical plexus, a further extensive metastasis of approx. 4 x 5 cm is now visible behind the internal jugular vein. This infiltrates the internal jugular vein at the back, hence the caudal separation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure and preservation of the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Caudal evacuation of level V, also here several nodes, so that level V b is also evacuated. Here without visible visualization of the thoracic duct, but lymph leakage. Selective bipolar coagulation, if lymph leakage persists, later repositioning of the tissue and in case of incomplete reduction, application of TachoSil and TaboTamp. Evacuation and completion of the neck preparation with evacuation of level I b and level II a. The accessorius nerve was already resected in the 1st metastasis. After exposure of the entire digastric muscle, resection of the muscle, careful removal of the submandibular gland from the surrounding tissue, carefully preserving the cranially preserved facial branches. First expose and preserve the facial artery. This and the lingual artery are later dissected and removed. After releasing the submandibular gland with uncinate process from the floor of the mouth, tunneling to the resection area. Partial resection of the mylohyoid muscle with widening of the pharyngotomy. Entering the posterior floor of the mouth. Widening of the pharyngotomy and successive release and mobilization of the tumour. The entire soft tissue covering the outside of the tumor in the area of the floor of the mouth and cervically is removed. Exposure and exposure of the base of the tongue after extending the pharyngotomy caudally. Now a good overview and macroscopic complete resection of the base of the tongue. Due to the alteration and manipulation of the tissue, only a thin ridge remains between the tumor part in the tonsil region and the tumor part at the base of the tongue after excision of the tumor. The site is marked with a corresponding suture and the tumor is sent for definitive histology. This is followed by the taking of marginal samples, completely covering all edges. These are diagnosed in the area of the base of the tongue caudally, close to the tumor, with discrete residual infiltrates. Due to the thickness of the post-resectate, however, a minimum safety margin of 9 mm is required here. Otherwise, all other tumor margin samples are clear, so that an R0 situation can be assumed here. Now measure a lobulated graft measuring approx. 13 x 9 cm in total. Turn to graft harvesting from the right thigh. Here, after identification of the main perforator and 3 further secondary perforators by Doppler sonography, marking of the graft. Medial incision. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and secure identification of the rectus femoris muscle. Slinging of the muscle. Strictly subfascial dissection. Identification of the pedicle vessel. Performing an extension incision. Further dissection of the pedicle and isolation. Release of the fascia above the intermedius portion. Complete cutting of the graft. Removal of the fascia lata. Caudal fascio cutaneous graft. Most of the perforators run with a small intramuscular course. Therefore use of a muscle cuff. Careful protection of the perforators. Isolation on the vascular pedicle and preparation of a strong artery and two draining veins with good confluence if the flap is properly vitalized. Deposition of the graft. Careful wound inspection. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure with local balancing plasty in the area of excess skin. Neck dissection on the right side and plastic tracheotomy were performed at the same time. Neck dissection on the right: skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the digastric muscle after exposure of the submandibular gland. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Preservation of the middle thyroid vein and the facial vein. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the hypoglossal nerve and the superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Evacuation of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and evacuation of level V with protection of the cervical plexus branches. Finally, wound inspection and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Tracheostomy: Insertion approx. 1 cm below the tracheostoma. Cut the skin and subcutaneous tissue horizontally. Exposure and ligation of the anterior jugular vein. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Entering the linea alba. Exposure of the anterior surface of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Exposure and transection of the thyroid isthmus after perforation. Complete visualization of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and careful incision of the tracheostoma on all sides. In the case of small dehiscence for neck dissection with extensive resection, the paralaryngeal muscles are later adapted with the subcutaneous tissue so that reasonably tight conditions can be created here. The patient is then reintubated, initially onto an 8 mm tube and later onto a cannula with an inner core. This succeeds without any problems. Suture fixation of the cannula. The transplant is then inserted. This is done step by step transorally and transcervically. Gradual incorporation of the graft. This works well with a good fit. Good volume filling in the area of the base of the tongue. Intact conditions. The resection area extends caudally into the vallecula and in the area of the pharynx up to the entrance of the piriform sinus. After complete incision, dissection of the flap vascular pedicle. Thrombosis of the partially detached superior thyroid artery is now evident. Despite cutting back the artery, no equivalent blood flow and clear thrombosis. Therefore ligation. Also thrombosis of the detached facial and lingual arteries. Dissection of the transverse cervical artery. This has a widely tortuous course. Free dissection of the artery, providing good opportunities for rotation. Perform the arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. This works very well. Tight conditions and immediate venous return flow. Now first dissection of an upper thyroid vein. This now shows clear thrombosis. Repeated irrigation with heparin does not lead to any relevant reflux. The facial vein is now dissected in the caudal direction. There is a branched course with palpatorily clear flow. After opening, the flow is regular so that this vein can now be used for connection after maximum mobilization of the artery. Performing the venous anastomosis with Coupler 3.5, which works well. Moderate tension conditions in relation to the arterial anastomosis. Regular flap vitality on inspection. Final inspection of the wound surfaces. Despite all the measures in level V b, there is still moderate lymphatic leakage after the above measures have been carried out, here with TachoSil and TaboTamp. Due to the arterial anastomosis via the arteria transversa cevicis, no further transpositions were necessary. Insertion of a guided 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. At the end of the operation, regular flap vitality and transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT3 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left with approx. 2/3 resection of the base of the tongue. Due to the extensive metastasis and aggressive local growth, adjuvant therapy is certainly urgently required. Please leave the cannula in place as long as possible postoperatively, for approx. 6 to 7 days, if the tracheostoma is clearly close to the left side of the neck with complex anastomosis. Depending on the left cervical lymph leakage, please start with conservative treatment. Strict avoidance of pressure bandages. Leave the 10 Redon drain in place until the flow rate is significantly reduced. Pull the Redon drainage by the surgeon. If the wound is healing properly, perform an X-ray gruel on the 10th postoperative day. Due to the extent of the tumor, the reconstruction and the patient's constitution, prolonged swallowing rehabilitation is to be expected. Depending on recovery of the general condition, planning of thoracic surgery to repair the round lung tumor.","Resection, Neck dissection, Plastic tracheotomy, Free flap (ALT), PEG placement

Then injection of Ultracaine. Entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the hypopharynx. There are no abnormalities here, the postcricoid region and both piriform sinuses are unremarkable. Then attempt to adjust the larynx. This is only possible with the smallest tube. The tumor has completely taken over the glottic plane and the glottis so that no lumen is visible. Then sterile washing and covering. Form an apron flap in the usual manner, integrating the tracheostoma. Suturing of the skin flap. Start with the neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath with free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of levels II to V while sparing the plexus branches and the hypoglossal nerve and facial vein. Then turn to the opposite side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the nervus accessorius, the cervical vascular sheath and free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Clearing of levels II to V while sparing the plexus branches. Exposure of the hypoglossus and facial vein. Clearing of the medial neck block. Level VI was divided in the middle and added to the neck preparations on each side. Then dissection of the cervical vascular sheath from the larynx on both sides. Dissection of the thyroid gland from the larynx on both sides. Ligation of the upper laryngeal bundle on both sides. Exposure of the hyoid bone. Removal of the hyoid bone. Skeletonization of the larynx so that in the anterior region .............. Release of the piriform sinus on both sides. Then enter the mouth with the large Langenbeck spatula and lift the base of the tongue. Perform the pharyngotomy at this point. Pull out the epiglottis and open the pharynx along the epiglottis. This is very easy on the right side, on the left side the tumor appears to have grown into the medial area of the piriform sinus, so the mucosa must be removed more generously here. The entire larynx is detached so that it is only attached to the trachea and the cricoid cartilage. The larynx is removed below the cricoid cartilage and sent for a frozen section. The pathologist can no longer detect any tumor in the edges of the incision and the specimen is therefore resected in sano in the frozen section. Then transition to insertion of a Provox prosthesis. Entry with the trocar and creation of a tracheoesophageal fistula and insertion of a size 10 Provox prosthesis using the pull-through method. Then perform a posteromedial esophagomyotomy on the left side. Perform a myotomy on the sternocleidomastoid muscle to flatten the tracheostoma. Performing the pharyngeal suture with single button sutures. Perform another pharyngeal suture over the first pharyngeal suture, also with single button sutures. The constrictor pharyngeal muscle is then adapted as well as possible. This cannot be done in all places so that the pharynx does not narrow, but so that the largest part of the 3rd pharyngeal suture is still covered. Insertion of 2 Redon drainage tubes. Cut out the skin on the tracheostoma, as it is massively macerated by the previously placed tracheostoma. Then suture the skin to the trachea. Fold back the apron flap and complete the mucocutaneous anastomosis in the tracheal area and close the wound in two layers. Please do not feed orally postoperatively and carry out an X-ray gruel swallow after 10 days, then build up the diet when the pharyngeal suture is tight.","Laryngectomy, Neck dissection, and Tracheotomy with Voice Prosthesis

The CT scan showed the tumor in direct contact with the internal carotid artery without any definite signs of infiltration. In addition, a subtotal thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein was found. Sonographic and computed tomographic findings of cN0 neck status without evidence of distant metastases.","First, a pharyngoscopy is performed to determine the exact extent of the tumor: An exophytic mass is found on the left oropharyngeal side wall. Tumor growth begins at the posterior palatal arch with transition to the lateral pharyngeal wall and to approximately one third of the posterior pharyngeal wall. The tonsil and the anterior palatal arch are not infiltrated macroscopically and palpatorily. Growth over the posterior palatal arch up to the vicinity of the parauvular mucosal triangle. Overall moderate palpatory displacement. After positioning the patient, first transoral tumor resection: To obtain an overview and safe resection, enter the anterior palatal arch, taking the tonsil with you. Entering the anterior palatal arch. Release of the tonsil using the dissection technique. Behind the tonsil without direct contact, but according to ....................... the tumorous mass is now encountered. First cut around the mass on all sides with an electric knife. Resection up to the middle of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Problem-free loosening and resection of the tumor to the caudal and medial border. Complete removal of the posterior palatal arch. After loosening the edges in depth, careful dissection. However, a good displacement layer is now visible here, so that the tumor can be completely resected transorally macroscopically in sano. Circumscribed exposed fatty tissue from the neck, but no direct contact with the carotid artery as described in the CT scan. The tumor is now sent macroscopically in toto for frozen section diagnostics. If the resection in the area of the parauvular triangle on the posterior palatal arch is macroscopically scarce, a complete resection is performed here as well as a covering final margin sample, which is also sent for frozen section diagnostics. The tumor is now diagnosed in sano on all sides; only in the area of the caudal pharyngeal margin is there a clear alteration with questionable CIS. A new resection is therefore performed here, which is diagnosed as completely tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Also basal free conditions. The deep wound bed is also resected later via pharyngotomy and placement of the vascular pedicle. After careful hemostasis, the neck is dissected on the left side: after injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline, the skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is modified in a curved fashion. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure and careful preservation of the external jugular vein, which is very pronounced. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery and vein, the hypoglossal nerve and the cervical vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. The vein shows clear wall changes, palpation with residual flow, no evidence of inflammatory changes, therefore the vein is left intact. Clear collateral formation with strong external jugular vein and anterior jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Overall macroscopically no suspicious nodes. Irrigation of the wound. Now turn to pharyngotomy. Resection of the digastric muscle, exposure of the stylohyoid. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and the external carotid artery. Preservation of the superior thyroid artery, the lingual artery, the facial artery and the occipital artery. Blunt perforation of the pharynx in the direction of the resection area. Widen the pharyngotomy until an approximately 3 ˝ finger-wide shaft is created. Basal co-resection of the wound bed. Neck dissection of the right side and radialis graft harvesting from the lower left side are now performed in parallel. Neck dissection on the right: In principle the same procedure as on the opposite side. Skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Clearing out the anterior neck preparation while carefully protecting the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve. Clearing out the accessorius triangle while carefully protecting the nerve. Completion of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Final wound inspection. Wound irrigation. In dry wound conditions, without macroscopically suspicious nodes, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Removal of the radialis graft from the left forearm: After marking a graft measuring 13 x 6 cm in total, using a skin monitor, the graft is cut into a bloodless area. Initially radial exposure and removal of the cephalic vein. Exposure and preservation of the superficial radial nerve ramus, which can remain completely intact. Expose the distal vascular pedicle. Dissection of the vascular pedicle. Strictly subfascial release of the graft. The ulnar artery lies deep and is not exposed. Strictly subfascial dissection of the graft with careful clipping of the outgoing muscle branches. Removal of the monitor bed. In the antecubital fossa it can now be seen that the cephalic vein remains relatively slender and does not form a visible bridge to the radial vein area. However, the radial veins unite to form a strong, common vessel, hence clipping of the cephalic vein, isolation also artery and vein. After reopening of the tourniquet, regular hand perfusion and excellent graft perfusion. Minutious hemostasis. Removal of the graft after regular blood flow. Subsequently, after wound inspection, careful, two-layered wound closure and insertion of the full-thickness skin graft lifted from the right groin. A vacuum sealing pump is then applied, the Kramer splint is placed in the functional position and the arm is repositioned. Full-thickness skin harvesting from the groin: For this purpose, cutting around an oval piece of skin measuring 15 x just under 6 cm, strictly cutaneous elevation, subcutaneous mobilization. Hemostasis and wound inspection. Placement of a 10 Redon drain and strong, two-layer wound closure under moderate tension. Now insertion of the graft combined transorally and transcervically. This is now considerably more difficult due to significant swelling in the throat and tongue area. Good fit, but extremely laborious insertion due to the local conditions and tight spaces. Finally, adequate suture intact on all sides. Positioning of the vascular pedicle and the cervical skin monitor. In the meantime, the tracheotomy was also performed due to the swelling conditions described: For this, with very deep lying cricoid cartilage, skin incision at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Cut through. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the very strong anterior jugular vein. Ligation of the infrahyoid muscles that represent the veins. Dissection of the musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the thyroid isthmus, which is coagulated if very thin. Very deep trachea, therefore insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedunculated Björk flap. Difficult incision with a low-lying trachea, but finally a wide tracheotomy and problem-free intubation onto an 8-gauge low-cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. This is followed by cervical vascular preparation. This involves conditioning the flap vessels and the strong facial artery, which corresponds most closely to the strong radial artery. Carefully adapt the vascular suture with 8.0 Ethilon. Subsequently, regular flow conditions with immediate venous return and excellent graft perfusion, therefore now conditioning of the external jugular vein. If the flow is good, measure a size 3.5 coupler and perform the venous anastomosis with the coupler without any problems. Subsequently, regular blood flow with renewed excellent vitality of the graft and the skin monitor. Positioning of the skin monitor and insertion and careful, two-layer wound closure after insertion of a 10 Redon drain. Vital graft conditions at the end of the operation. Transfer of the patient intubated to the intensive care unit. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT2 cN0 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left. Laborious but sufficient reconstruction using a radialis graft. Due to the laborious intake conditions, the evaluation of the dietary reconstruction .............. Swallowing function should only be evaluated from the 9th to 10th postoperative day. Cannula supply, depending on swallowing function.

Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the pharynx and larynx area. In the pharynx, an extensive exophytic mass can be seen in the area of the oropharynx, in the area of the tonsil lobe, infiltrating the anterior and posterior palatal arch and parts of the soft palate. The other pharyngeal areas and the larynx are unremarkable. Sterile washing and draping. Start with neck dissection on the right and left side in parallel. Right side, start with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Skin incision so that the large cystic metastasis is cut around. A large area of skin must also be resected. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the caudal region. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and exposure of the capsule of the mass. Dissection of the lower part of the internal jugular vein. Then take over by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and further release of the mass. The mass must be pushed away from the carotid artery. This is achieved without any problems in the area of the common carotid artery. In the bulb area, it can be seen that the external carotid artery is infiltrated by the tumor. The internal jugular vein is then ligated and the mass removed, taking with it the sternocleidomastoid muscle with which the mass has grown together. The hypoglossal nerve is also infiltrated and must be severed as well as the accessorius nerve. The plexus branches of the cervical plexus can be preserved. The vagus nerve can also be preserved. Ultimately, the entire neck preparation with the metastasis is removed en bloc. Only the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery as well as the vagus nerve and the border cord remain. At the same time, perform the neck dissection on the left side through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Neck dissection on the left: Skin incision, transection of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Subplatysmal dissection and elevation of the apron flap. Suturing of the apron flap. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissection along the muscle in depth until the cervical plexus is exposed. Identification of the omohyoid muscle and dissection along the muscle to the hyoid bone. Identification of the accessorius nerve and the digastric muscle. Dissection medially to the hyoid bone. Release of the submandibular gland, which is left in place during dissection. Identification of the hypoglossal nerve. This can be safely spared. Dissection along the vein from caudal to cranial and detachment of the neck preparation. Sending in levels II, III, IV and V in individual preparations. Irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer and completion of the neck dissection on the left side without complications. Insertion of the tonsil plug and inspection of the tumor region. Incision of the tumor region with a safety margin of at least 1 cm in the oropharynx using the electric needle. Dissection with the needle as well as with scissors and bipolar forceps. The preparation is obtained en bloc and is placed on cork for frozen section. In the frozen section, all margins and also basal R0. The tumor resection creates a defect towards the neck. The tumor itself had no contact with the large metastasis and was still separated from it by a thin layer of tissue. Now measurement of the defect and lifting of the radialis graft from the left forearm by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Lifting the radialis graft: Marking the graft on the distal forearm on the left side. S-shaped skin incision and proximal forearm. Exposure of the confluence and dissection of a superficial vein (cephalic vein) up to the radial flap edge. Incision along the marked skin incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the forearm fascia and subfascial preparation of the radialis graft. Care is taken to protect the external ramus of the radial nerve, particularly at the radial end. The ulnar artery can also be safely spared. Dissection of the distal section of the radial artery and ligation of the radial artery after prior control by clamping with a vascular clip. A good perfusion signal can be measured on the index finger during clamping. Then preparation of the radial artery graft from the depth under constant bipolar coagulation and placement of vessel clips on the perforator vessels. Dissection up to the crook of the elbow, reliable identification of the brachial artery, the ulnar artery and the interosseous artery. Separation of the radial artery after the exit of the interosseous artery. Separation of the veins and irrigation of the graft with heparin. Lift the split skin from the right thigh using <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Insertion of the graft from transcervical and transoral through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Creation of the arterial and venous anastomosis. Arterial to the superior thyroid artery, venous to the facial vein and a second vein. The anastomosis is located on the left side. The stalk was guided over the larynx to the left. Then skin suture in the area of the left side of the neck and a second graft must be lifted to close the right side of the neck. A pectoralis major graft was harvested from the right side for this purpose. To do this, cut around a skin island 8 x 4 cm medial to the nipple. Then dissect down to the thoracic wall. Lifting of the petoral muscle from the thoracic wall. Detachment of the attachment of the pecotralis muscle from the sternum and humerus. The pedicle is clearly identified. The graft is pulled through a tunnel representing the theoretical deltopectoral flap. The deltopectoral flap was not lifted off, but only tunneled under medially. Dissection of a skin flap in the neck area, which is folded back. Fitting of the pectoralis major graft. Adjustment of the folded back neck skin in the sense of a plastic reconstruction. Beforehand, insertion of a Redon drain and completion of the procedure without complications. After the tumor resection, a tracheotomy was performed between the second and third tracheal cartilage in the usual manner. Insertion of a tracheal cannula. Suturing of the tracheostomy tube. Continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Flap checks in the usual manner. Presentation at the tumor conference after receipt of the histology. X-ray pelvic swallow after 14 days.","Resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Pectoralis Major flap

Entering with the esophagogastroscope. Pre-viewing into the stomach. Inconspicuous conditions on all sides. Perform the PEG insertion with good diaphanoscopy using the thread pull-through method. This is successful without any problems. Entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the hypopharynx and larynx. In the laryngeal region, a whitish deposit can be seen on the anterior third of the left vocal fold, which extends to the anterior commissure. Advance the microscope and remove this deposit while protecting the vocal folds. Microlaryngoscopically, the deposit looks like a leukoplakia. There is no indication of a polyp. Then insertion of the retractor and inspection of the tonsil region. On the right side, a crater-shaped change can be seen at the lower pole of the tonsil. The tonsil itself is also rough. Start of tumor tonsillectomy with incision of the mucosa and exposure of the upper pole. Removal of the tonsil, taking some of the musculature from the tonsil bed and taking part of the base of the tongue with it. This guarantees a sufficient safety margin. The lateral border to the neck is still intact. The tonsil is suture-marked to the frozen section. Unfortunately, the previously biopsied squamous cell carcinoma can no longer be found in the frozen section, but the margins are definitely clear, i.e. definitely an R0 situation. After consultation with the pathology department, the squamous cell carcinoma is to be looked for more precisely in the final histology. Neck dissection performed in the meantime. Transverse skin incision for this. Separation of the platysma. Formation of a platysma flap. Then expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. Then free preparation of the vein. Level II shows a very large metastasis, Level II b shows several smaller ones and Level III and IV also show enlarged, coarse lymph nodes. Removal of the neck specimen en bloc while sparing the plexus branches. The large metastasis in level II can be easily detached from the internal jugular vein, but its tip extends very far towards the border of the oropharynx, creating a very small, 0.5 x 0.5 cm fistula to the oropharynx. This fistula is sutured over several times and the stylohyoid muscle and the posterior belly of the digaster are sutured over it for safety. A tracheotomy is then performed. For this, a skin incision is made below the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the musculature. Entering the linea alba. Pushing the muscles aside. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Insertion of an 8-bore tracheal cannula. Suturing of the 8 mm tracheostomy tube. Then re-inspection of the oropharynx. The wound area is very large, so that the tracheostomy is definitely justified. Stitching over tissue in the potential fistula area. The operation was completed without complications. No oral food for 5 days please. If there are signs of fistula, open the neck. Insertion of a flap and irrigation so that the saliva can drain and then wait, as the fistula is really very small.","Resection, Neck dissection, and PEG placement

Positioning of the patient. Laryngoscopic insertion of the flexible esophagoscope into the esophagus. Mirroring under visualization into the stomach, where a regular folded relief can be seen. If the diaphanoscopy is positive, the PEG tube is placed in the typical position using the thread pull-through method. This was successful without any problems. The patient was given an antibiotic cover intraoperatively. When withdrawing the esophagoscope, careful inspection of the esophageal mucosa, which is normal and inconspicuous. Dressing is applied. Reposition the patient for transoral laser resection. To do this, adjust the supraglottic plane with the spreading laryngoscope. The tumor extends laterally over the entire right arytenoid cusp up to the pharyngoepiglottic fold and the medial piriform sinus wall. The tumor is cut around with the CO2 laser and carefully dissected in a circular fashion with a sufficient safety margin. Vascular inflows are repeatedly monopolar coagulated during the dissection. Part of the pharyngoepiglottic fold is successfully preserved. It is also possible to preserve most of the cartilaginous arytenoid and only partially resect it. The tumor certainly does not reach the tip of the piriform sinus and can also be removed here with a sufficient safety margin far above the esophageal entrance level. In the area of the Arys, take a representative sample of the edge, which is described intraoperatively as tumor-free. In the area of the other resection margins, the tumor appears to be resected far in sano, so that only marginal samples are sent for final histology. These completely depict the tumor resection. Subsequent subtle hemostasis using monopolar coagulation. Dry wound conditions and very good aspect. If the wound conditions are dry and the arytenoid is standing, the tracheostomy can be omitted here. The patient should be fed via the PEG tube for the first few postoperative days. Then slowly build up the diet with porridge. Transfer the patient for neck dissection on both sides. Start with the neck dissection on the right side. Make an incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissect in depth in layers and expose the cervical vascular sheath. Separate the neck preparation over the cervical vascular sheath. A conglomerate of enlarged lymph nodes can be seen in the area of the vein angle. Exposure of the resection borders with the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digaster. Exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve. Long-distance dissection of the cervical vascular sheath with long-distance dissection of the vagus nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve, hypoglossal nerve and vagus nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Subsequent resection of the lateral neck preparation together with the accessorius triangle. Removal of the hypoglossal triangle and then the ventral neck preparation. The final result is a resection of levels Ib to V. All outlets of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery can be preserved during dissection. Careful irrigation of the wound. Dry wound conditions. Insertion of a size 10 Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure dressing. Neck dissection of the left side. Almost identical procedure here. This also results in the dissection of levels Ib to V. All vessels in the sense of the branches of the internal jugular vein and the external carotid artery can also be preserved here. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. No conspicuous nodes were found in the area of the left neck during dissection. Dry wound conditions. Irrigation of the neck and insertion of a size 10 Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure.

In addition, a marginal sample from the soft tissues is also sent to the frozen section as a craniobasal marginal sample. Here in the frozen section all specimens are healthy. Thus R0 resection. Repositioning for neck dissection on both sides: skin disinfection, draping. Start with the right side: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Large cranial metastasis. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal and external carotid artery, internal jugular vein and vagus nerve as well as the accessorius and hypoglossal nerves.

The endolarynx and the trachea down to the carina are found to be normal. The patient is now intubated by the anesthesia colleagues. The surgeon then positioned the patient's head. A team time-out was carried out before the start of the procedure. Now insertion of the mouthguard. Enter with the Kleinsasser C-tube for pharyngoscopy. First, advance the Kleinsasser tube into the hypopharynx and inspect both piriform sinuses down to the esophageal entrance. Here as well as in the postcricoid area inconspicuous mucosal conditions. Now inspection of the larynx. However, there are no abnormalities here, nor in the interaryngeal region. The epiglottis and vallecula as well as the base of the tongue are also unremarkable. Now insertion of the Mc Ivor mouth spatula and initially careful inspection of the oral cavity and palpation, which revealed no further abnormalities. The overall dental status is incomplete. An approximately 1.5 x 1.5 cm large, partly exophytic, partly crater-shaped tumor is now visible in the area of the left-sided uvula base, which macroscopically reaches at least the midline and extends to the left tonsil lobe on the left side. The tonsils themselves are unremarkable on both sides. A right-sided velotracture was performed and the posterior surface of the soft palate was inspected. This is not penetrated by the tumor. Now demonstration of the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who advises transoral resection in the sense of an excisional biopsy. The tumor is now incised on all sides with the electric needle with a sufficient safety distance of about 1 cm and the tumor is successively released alternately with bipolar coagulation. The uvula falls away completely. The posterior palatal arch can be partially preserved. In the area of the transition to the left tonsil lobe, the resectate is ultimately only very barely in sano macroscopically. Therefore, a generous resection is performed here again. The tumor specimen and the resected specimen are thread-marked and sent for frozen section examination. The frozen section shows the area in question on the main specimen to be only 1 mm in sano, but the resected specimen shows no evidence of carcinoma extension. The resectate is therefore assessed as R0 in the frozen section. Careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. After sufficient waiting time, check again for blood dryness, which is present. In the meantime, perform the OED. Under good visualization, pre-mirroring into the stomach. Here the gastric mucosa is unremarkable on all sides. On endoscopy, at most a slight change, consistent with mild reflux esophagitis. After consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, a PEG is currently not being used due to the primarily not expected functional problems. The procedure was therefore completed without complications. Repositioning of the patient by the surgeon. Conclusion: R0 resection of a left-sided cT1 uvula carcinoma in a frozen section.

The exphytically growing tumor in the area of the right tonsil region can be seen, passing over to the base of the tongue towards the valecula. The piriform sinus on both sides, the visible larynx and the base of the tongue on the left are unremarkable. Oedematous mucosa was probably noticed on CT. Now detailed consultation with the anesthesiologist regarding the intraoperative procedure. Due to the small mouth opening, the tumor can only be extirpated by splitting the lower jaw. Therefore, senior physician <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the maxillofacial surgery department will be informed later about the mandibular division. First of all, start again with the PEG placement. Very difficult insertion of the flexible esophagoscope into the upper esophageal opening. Due to the very narrow conditions, it is finally possible to enter the oesophagus. Advance into the stomach. Inconspicuous conditions there. Good diaphanoscopy. Puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube. This cannot be pulled through, so check again with the MLE tube. There is a snag in the area of the tube. The tube is therefore removed again from the cranial side. Careful insertion of the flexible endoscope again. The esophagus is unremarkable. No evidence of perforation, advancement into the stomach. No bleeding there either, unremarkable conditions. Another puncture of the stomach and now problem-free insertion of the PEG tube. Perioperative administration of Unacid i.v.. Continue this postoperatively. Now start of neck dissection on the right side with preparation for splitting the lower jaw. To do this, make a skin incision in the area of the lower lip, moving onto the chin, onto the submandibular region and finally into the scar for neck dissection from the earlobe to the supraclavicular region. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, the facial vein and individual smaller veins. Exposure of the vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, digastric muscle, posterior vena cava. Very difficult dissection of metastatically altered lymph nodes from the jugular vein in the cranial part. Further dissection of the posterior neck preparation up to the supraclavicular region. There, the preparation was removed and repositioned to prevent a fistula. Now dissection of the hypoglossal nerve and the submandibular gland. Dissection of the anterior neck preparation with exposure of the external and internal carotid artery as well as the superior thyroid artery and the facial artery. The submandibular gland is also removed. To do this, dissect from the facial vein towards the mylohyoid muscle and cut and ligate the excretory duct. Removal of the submandibular gland. Neck dissection is also carried out in regions I and II a and b. All lymph nodes in the area of the facial vein medial to the mandible are removed and also included in the preparation. Now call in <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the maxillofacial surgery department. He first fits a plate in the area of the lower jaw with eight screws. The lower jaw is then split in a staircase between the canine and the first molar. After opening the lower jaw, the muscles of the floor of the mouth are cut through and dissected in the direction of the tumor. Now very difficult resection of the tumor, initially in the area of the laternal tongue and the base of the tongue. Then further laterally into the upper retromolar region towards the hard and soft palate. Here, a large part of the hard and soft palate falls down to the uvula. Dissection of the tumor then in the depth of the pterygoid muscle. The tumor can be further detached here. It is now possible to remove the tumor in toto in the block with great effort. Circular marginal samples are taken and sent for frozen section. Result: All marginal samples are considered to be tumor-free, and the biopsy from the left valecula, which was also performed, shows no evidence of tumor. An A0 situation can be assumed. Now reposition the patient. Removal of the ALT. Then perform the neck dissection on the left side. Also make a skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, from the earlobe to the jugulum. Dissection of the muscle, exposure of the internal jugular vein, the vagus nerve and the accessorius nerve. Dissection of the accessorius triangle after exposure of the digastric muscle, posterior vena cava. Dissection of the neck preparation caudally. Deposition supraclavicularly after repositioning. Finally, dissection of the facial vein, the external and internal carotid arteries and the hypoglossal nerve. Complete the anterior neck preparation, including the submandibular gland. Complete hemostasis with H2O2 swabs and bipolar coagulation. No more bleeding. Insertion of a Redon drainage, subcutaneous suture, skin suture and wound dressing. In this area. Now perform the tracheotomy. Y-shaped skin incision in the longitudinal direction. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue, exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Opening of the same in the area of the linea alba, exposure of the thyroid isthmus and the cricoid cartilage. Separation and transection of the thyroid isthmus. The trachea is now exposed and opened. Creation of a Björ flap. Opening of the trachea so that an 8 mm tube can be inserted without difficulty. Re-intubation of the patient and epithelization of the tracheostoma with non-absorbable sutures and simultaneous application of skin sutures in this area. Now the ALT taken from the thigh, which is sized accordingly, is fitted into the tumor resection area. Incision with several Vicryl sutures, initially in the area of the naso- and oropharynx. Very difficult conditions here. However, the flap now fits very well. Suturing in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, extending to the base of the tongue and the mandibular region as well as in the retromolar region. Very good fit of the flap. Now primary suture in the area of the floor of the mouth, both the musculature and the mucosa. Call in <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the MKG. He closes and sutures the lower jaw and reattaches the perforated plate with eight screws for fixation. Very good fit. Occlusion fits. Now suction of wound secretions in the neck area and exposure of the superior thyroid artery and a large neck vein, which are well suited for anastomosis. First anastomosis of the artery. The artery is first anastomosed at the end. There are several leaks, so that the anastomosis is first cut once again and in the second attempt an anastomosis is achieved under microscopic control. Very good flow in the area of the artery. No leakage of blood. Repeated flushing with heparin. Finding the venous limb of the flap and dissection of a jugular vein. Using the coupler, the two venous ends can be approximated and anastomosed end-to-end. Very difficult dissection. Repeated irrigation with heparin. The venous return flow increases significantly over time, so that the arterial limb functions very well. After performing the coupler anastomosis, venous return is also very good. Flap well perfused. Adaptation of the anastomosis in the neck area. Now again thorough hemostasis with H2O2 irrigation and bipolar coagulation. No more bleeding. Insertion of Redon drains, subcutaneous and skin sutures. Closure also in the area of the lower lip and chin. No bleeding at the end of the operation. Detailed consultation with the anesthesiologist. Repeated administration of Unacid. Please pass this on postoperatively, paying particular attention to abdominal problems due to the two PEG insertions. Detailed consultation with the anesthesia department. The patient is intubated and ventilated and transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. This is followed by the surgical report for lifting the ALT flap of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. After identification of the landmarks, doppler sonographic identification of the main perforator and three small secondary perforators. After measuring the graft configuration for soft palate and tongue base. Initial medial incision and separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue, visualization of the rectus femoris muscle, strictly subpartial preparation. Reliable identification of the muscle, visualization of the very strong main perforator, therefore limitation to the main perforator. Identification of the strong vascular pedicle. Complete cutting of the graft. This shows a purely fasciocutaneous graft. A relatively thin graft can therefore be lifted here. Completely recut, taking the fascia lata in the graft area with it. Careful protection of the main perforator, leaving a small muscle cuff in the area of the perforator outlet. Isolation on the vascular pedicle, exposure of the confluence of the veins, exposure of the strong artery. Protection of the ramus obliquus and, if the vitality of the graft is excellent, removal of the graft. Careful wound inspection, insertion of a 10-gauge redon drain and careful multi-layer wound closure. The graft is then implanted transmandibularly.","Resection, Neck dissection, Free flap coverage (ALT)

For G3 differentiation, a distance of 1 cm is measured and the resection margin is marked. Successive removal of the tumor from <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> alternately. The left tonsil is also removed here. After successive removal, the specimen is marked under inspection and palpation. Successive hemostasis. A resection is taken on the right parauvular side. Everything goes to the frozen section. The frozen section shows an R0 resection. Tracheotomy: skin incision, dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Dissection along the linea alba through the prelaryngeal musculature. Finding the cricoid cartilage. Careful coagulation of the thyroid gland and dissection of the thyroid gland. Free preparation of the trachea. Visor tracheotomy between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp. Suturing in the usual manner. Neck dissection on the right side: skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth. Exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and cranial dissection. Exposure of the submandibular gland and finding the posterior venter of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the digastric muscle and successive dissection of this up to region II b. Multiple suspicious metastases are found in region II b, also in the jugulofacial angle. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and visualization of the same. It can be seen that the large metastasis in the jugulofacial angle is connected to the facial vein. For this reason, ligation of the facial vein and removal of the metastasis. The hypoglossal nerve can be identified and spared. Successive dissection of the other suspicious masses, sparing the internal jugular vein. Successive dissection of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the brachial plexus. Identification and protection of the vagus nerve. The cervical nerve can also be spared. Removal of the lateral neck preparation. Successive removal of the medial neck preparation. Irrigation and successive hemostasis. If there is no evidence of increased bleeding, insertion of a Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Lifting of the radial artery flap by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>: marking of the radial artery. Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders 4 x 6 cm on the distal forearm proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped course. Cut proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue from proximal. Identification. Exposure of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the graft margin. It can be seen that the cephalic vein is pulling towards the skin, away from the planned skin island. The vein is therefore severed here. Identification of the external ramus of the radial nerve. Elevation of the radial part while leaving the fascia of the tendon of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent dissection down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the forearm graft edge up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendinous tissue on the flexor tendon and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes under good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry, measured on the thumb, approx. 99%, the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation with silk thread. Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and sparing of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery and the mediana cubita, the ulnar artery. First of all, expose the radial artery. Then of two veins of the superficial venous system, vascular ligation using silk thread and vascular clips. Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Defect coverage of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Application of a wound dressing and forearm splint. Completion of graft elevation without complications. ND left skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth. Exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and cranial dissection. Exposure of the submandibular gland and finding the posterior venter of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the digastric muscle and successive dissection of this up to region II b. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and exposure of the same. Ligation of the facial vein and removal of the metastasis. The hypoglossal nerve can be identified and spared. Successive dissection of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the brachial plexus. Identification and protection of the vagus nerve. The cervical nerve can also be spared. Removal of the lateral neck preparation. Successive removal of the medial neck preparation. Dissection of the superior thyroid artery as a connecting vessel. After removal of the submandibular gland on the left side while protecting the lingual nerve, an orotracheal fistula is created to pull the flap through. This is pulled through and attached to the defect. The posterior part of the flap is sutured to the posterior palatal arch, the anterior part of the flap to the anterior palatal arch and the lateral part within the tonsillar ligament. This is done with 4-0 single button Vicryl sutures. Performing the anastomosis in the sense of an arterial anastomosis between the radial artery and the superior thyroid artery on the left side as well as two end-to-side anastomoses to the internal jugular vein.

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure with laryngectomy was recommended.","Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, the primary tumor region is first inspected. After entering with the Kleinsasser tube, the exophytic and ulcerated tumor is already visible in the area caudal to the left tonsil, spreading caudally over the lateral pharyngeal wall and extending into the piriform sinus, filling it completely and extending over the anterior wall and into the medial wall, infiltrating the larynx. Therefore confirmation of the indication for laryngectomy. Free postcricoid and esophageal entrance. The entire right side is also tumor-free, but due to the elongated, broad tumor course in the area of the pharyngeal side wall, reconstruction is probably required. A nasogastric feeding tube is now inserted under visualization. Repositioning of the patient. Lifting of an apron flap by cutting through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection and cranial preparation of the platysma. Start with neck dissection of the right side. Dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland and exposure of the digastric muscle. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the hypoglossal nerve and superior thyroid artery. A true facial vein does not exist. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Cranial exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the posterior neck area with careful protection and exposure of the cervical plexus roots. Macroscopically no conspicuous nodules here. Careful hemostasis. Turning to the opposite side. Now the same primary procedure on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle while preserving the external jugular vein. Free preparation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland and exposure of the digastric muscle. Clearing out the anterior neck preparation while carefully protecting the superior thyroid artery, hypoglossal nerve and the slender facial vein. Complete the neck dissection after exposing the accessory nerve in the case of conspicuous nodes in the jugular-facial angle, exposing the cervical plexus roots, the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve corresponding to the opposite side on the left. Resection up to level V b. Careful check for lymphatic leakage. Dry conditions here. Careful hemostasis. Turn to tumor resection. Detachment of the infrahyoid musculature. Skeletonization of the larynx on the right side. Careful and complete release of the piriform sinus. On the left side, the attempt to detach the thyroid cartilage horn already reveals an adhesion or direct adherence to the tumor; if partially opened here, the suture is marked in the sense of a suture closure for later marking and covering of the margins. Skeletonize the cricoid cartilage and trachea while exposing and detaching the thyroid gland. Now enter enorally in the area of the vallecula on the right side, widen along the aryepiglottic fold and proceed in a mucosa-sparing manner. After widening the pharyngotomy, a good overview is now obtained. As described above, the tumor infiltrates caudal to the tonsil. Incision with a safety margin. Somewhat vulnerable conditions in the area of the glossotonsillar groove, otherwise macroscopically all around in sano incision of the tumor. Good control of the deep infiltration. Supply and removal of the lingual artery on the left side. Largely sparing of the postcricoid mucosa and removal of the tumor macroscopically in sano. The marginal specimen is now largely removed from the specimen. The site already described in the area of the thyroid cartilage horn on the left or the pharyngeal side wall here is additionally covered in the area of the soft tissue. In addition, in situ marginal sampling of the described vulnerable area completely in the base of the tongue up to the tonsil lobe. In the frozen section diagnostics, all tumor samples are now diagnosed as dysplasia and carcinoma-free, therefore an R0 situation can be assumed here. Careful hemostasis. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Defect reconstruction. Inspection of the defect. There is a hypopharyngeal defect starting at the soft palate up to the esophageal entrance. More than half of the pharyngeal mucosa is missing on the soft palate and in the upper part of the hypopharynx. Primary suturing is not possible in this area. A quarter to a third is missing in the distal area at the entrance to the esophagus. Primary suturing is still acceptable here. Decision to reconstruct the defect with an anterolateral transfemoral graft from the right. Intraoperative demo again to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Then turn to the thigh. First Doppler the perforating vessels. Five good perforator vessels can be identified, three of which can be claimed as main perforators. Mark the graft 12 x 7 cm so that the doubled perforator vessels are centrally located in the area of the graft. Incise the upper edge. Expose the fascia and the rectus femoris muscle. Exposure of the intermedius muscle and the sulcus. Exposing the descending ramus, the circumflex femoral artery and locating the outlets of the perforating vessels. This was successful without any problems. The perforating vessels are dissected from the pedicle to the periphery in the direction of the muscle and skin. Cut around the entire graft and remove the distal end of the stalk. Then develop the graft while protecting the perforator vessels. Some muscle is left around the perforator vessels on the posterior surface. Deposit the pedicle relatively far proximally. A good artery and two veins can be elevated. The nerve is severed. Bipolar coagulation. Insertion of a Redon drain and direct wound closure in the area of the thigh. Now turn to the pharyngeal defect. First conditioning of blood vessels. The vascular situation is very poor. There is only a stump of the superior thyroid on both sides. There is virtually nothing left of the venous connecting vessels except for an external jugular vein and the internal jugular vein. The stump of the superior thyroid on the left side is conditioned as well as the external and internal jugular veins. First fitting of the transplant. Sutures are placed in the area of the oropharynx and hypopharynx on the left side. Suturing in the graft. This is very difficult as the patient cannot recline the head and the graft has to be inserted very far cranially on the soft palate and at the base of the tongue. Finally, complete pharyngeal closure by the graft and primary pharyngeal suture in the distal area. Then conditioning of the flap vessels and start with the anastomosis of the artery. This is successful without any problems. Then anastomosis of the external jugular vein with a graft vein. This is very difficult due to a large difference in caliber. This difference in caliber can only be partially compensated for by cutting the graft vein at an angle. Another vein must be placed end-to-side on the left internal jugular vein. This is also not easy. In the end, very good pedicle pulsation and extremely good reflux in the veins. At the end, the tracheostoma is sutured. The apron flap is folded back. Redon drains inserted beforehand. Graft control from transorally. Good graft perfusion here. The patient goes to the intensive care unit ventilated. Please continue 3 x 3 g Unacid for 24 hours postoperatively as well as daily flap checks according to the usual schedule.

This is extremely difficult with poor mouth opening and poor hyperextensibility of the neck. With Cormack III, an inspection of the upper parts of the trachea with 0° optics is possible. The glottis is non-irritating and unremarkable. The patient is then intubated by the surgeon with great effort. Overall difficult airway. The esophagus is then inspected as part of flexible esophagogastroscopy. It is extremely difficult to enter the upper esophageal sphincter in the case of esophageal cancer and radiation. Finally, the flexible instrument can be advanced with difficulty up to 20 cm from the tooth row. This reveals a web-like stenosis of the esophagus that cannot be overcome by the flexible endoscope. In this case, if the patient has undergone pre-treatment and has a malignant tumor, no forced attempt is made, so that esophagoscopy is only performed up to 20 cm from the tooth row and the distal parts of the esophagus can then no longer be inspected. Removal of the esophagoscope. Now reposition the patient and inspect the oral cavity and oropharynx as well as the hypopharyngeal and laryngeal skeleton. In the hypopharyngeal and laryngeal region, the mucosal conditions are unremarkable. In the area of the oropharynx, an exophytic mass can be seen in the area of the glossotonsillar groove. The tongue is clearly fixed and the posterior part is clearly scarred and hardened. The tongue is then sutured and an oral retractor inserted. If the findings are histologically confirmed externally, resection begins from the anterior margin with a safety margin of around 5 mm. The resection extends into the body of the tongue. It can be seen here that the tumor has clearly grown submucosally into the body of the tongue and into the base of the tongue. Two large tumor necrosis cavities can be seen here. The external CT is superimposed by massive artifacts, so that this area could not be evaluated. The overall extent of the tumor thus proved to be much larger than estimated preoperatively. The tumor is then incised with an electric needle. Care is taken to maintain a safety margin of around 5 mm. After the body of the tongue can be mobilized better with increasing resection, it becomes apparent that the tumour is spreading to the tonsil lobe. Therefore, resection up to the alveolar ridge at the back of the posterior molars up to the tonsillar lobe. The resection extends from here to the anterior and posterior palatal arch. The preparation is then sent for histological examination. Subsequently, marginal samples are taken from all representative areas of deposition. Subsequent subtle hemostasis. The tumor is macroscopically and palpatorily distant from the healthy tissue. If the wound is dry, infiltrate bupivacaine into the body of the tongue. As the wound area is now clearly extensive and the patient has a restricted airway and therefore a significantly impaired airway, <CLINICIAN_NAME> is consulted and an intraoperative discussion regarding tracheostomy is held. A consensus was reached to perform a small tracheostomy in the sense of a protective tracheostomy. Wound check again. Removal of the mouth block and loosening of the tongue retaining suture. Then injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline in front of the trachea. Transverse skin incision and layered preparation in depth. Separation of the platysma. Separation of the prelaryngeal muscles. Layered dissection in depth. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is undermined and stitched around on both sides after it has been severed. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Now incise the trachea between the second and third cartilage clasp. Preparation of a Björk flap. Circular suturing of the tracheostoma. Then reintubation to an 8 mm tracheal cannula with a large tracheal lumen. This was successful without any problems. Then dressing and fixation of the cannula. Final enoral check. Dry wound conditions. The patient is transferred to the in-house intensive care unit for safety and monitoring. This concludes the procedure. Postoperatively, the patient's swallowing function must now be monitored. The patient is not yet neck-dissected on the left side, so that depending on the functional result, treatment and defect coverage using a radial flap is still possible here.","Uvula partial resection, Panendoscopy

The primary surgical procedure was decided in our interdisciplinary tumor conference.,"First, after transnasal intubation and preparation by the anesthesia colleagues, positioning of the patient. First perform a pharyngoscopy. Enter with the small bore tube. Inspection of the inconspicuous oral cavity. A tumorous, exophytic area can now be seen, starting in the area of the tonsil lobe, which passes over the glossotonsillar groove into the base of the tongue, infiltrates the posterior floor of the mouth submucosally and extends caudally towards the pharyngoepiglottic fold. Overall, a well-defined tumor process. On palpation, however, the extensive submucosal growth from the posterior floor of the mouth and pharyngeal side wall towards the cervical region is conspicuous. Extensive tumor masses here. Transoral resection of the tumor is therefore performed first. Release of the paratonsillar tonsil ligament, initially leaving the posterior palatal arch intact. However, this is later resected transcervically. Widening of the safety margin. Resection up to the buccal. Release of the glossotonsillar groove and the posterior edge of the tongue. Resection towards the base of the tongue. Here, however, significant deep growth and submucosal growth. Therefore, the soft palate, the cheek, the posterior floor of the mouth and the edge of the tongue are now covered. These are assessed as completely free of carcinoma. Therefore, if there is extensive submucosal growth in the area of the floor of the mouth and the side wall of the pharynx, reposition for further transcervical resection. First make the skin incision, curved at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, which is relatively strong here, the hypoglossal nerve and the cervical vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Here a few lymph nodes that are not necessarily suspicious macroscopically. Exposure of the accessor nerve. A round, rough and highly suspicious mass measuring approx. 3 x 3 cm can be seen below the accessorius nerve. Resection of the mass with careful protection of the nerve and preservation of the cervical plexus branches. Complete the accessorius triangle and level V while carefully preserving the nerve branches. Subsequent release of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the facial artery and vein first, later both are ligated and removed during the extension of the tumor resection. Complete exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Resection of the digastric muscle. At the posterior margin of the submandibular gland, the submucosal part of the tumor is already visible. Clear tumor cone towards the cervical region. Widen the safety margin. Involvement of the posterior floor of mouth muscles. Entering enorally via the posterior floor of the mouth. Palpation now reveals a massive tumor block extending caudally over the lateral pharyngeal wall. Hence skeletonization of the hypoglossal nerve. Visualization of the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the prevertebral fascia from the cervical vascular sheath. This allows good mobilization of the tumour. Incision of the tumor with a safety margin and resection of the tumor including the posterior floor of mouth muscles and the pharyngeal side wall with a safety margin of a good 1 cm. Macroscopically clearly complete resection. Macroscopically slightly scarce conditions in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth with submucosal growth, but free marginal samples. Completely imaged margin samples are then taken. These are classified as completely tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Finally, an extensive defect of the pharyngeal side wall with approx. 1/3 resection of the right-sided tongue base and resection of the posterior soft palate to parauvular, additional resection of the right tongue edge and the posterior floor of the mouth was found. Therefore, a graft of up to 13 x 10 cm in total is measured. First, however, the neck is dissected on the left side. Curved skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Here in the cranial area after a previous operation with scarring. Exposure of the auricular nerve. An external jugular vein is not visible here. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve and the facial vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Here a few macroscopically not necessarily suspicious masses. Exposure and preservation of the accessorius nerve. Release of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and removal of level V with protection of the cervical plexus branches. Final wound inspection. If the wound is dry, wound irrigation, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. The radialis graft is now removed from the left forearm and the plastic tracheotomy is performed in parallel. Firstly, the tracheotomy: After making a skin incision at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. This is relatively deep. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection after ligation and coagulation. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea with a low trachea. Insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma. Subsequent intubation with an 8-gauge Rüsch cannula, which is suture-fixed. Now to lift the radialis graft from the left: After marking the graft with a special configuration for the soft palate and base of the tongue, start with a tourniquet. Incision of the graft. Due to the size of the graft, a monitor is not lifted. First expose and remove the cephalic vein. Performing the...... ........ Maneuver to identify the ramus superficialis nervi radialis. Identification and visualization of the distal vascular pedicle. Cut after ligation. Ulnar release strictly subfascial with careful protection of the superficial ulnar artery, which is completely spared including the perivascular tissue. Strictly subfascial release of the specimen with release of the vascular pedicle. A small, medially pulling branch of the superficial radial nerve ramus must be resected, but the main trunk must be preserved. Proximal dissection with clipping of the descending pedicle vessels. Expose the brachial artery in the crook of the elbow with the exit of the powerful ulnar artery. The common interosseous artery arises here from the ulnar artery, therefore the radial artery can be dissected up to the brachial artery. There is a strong confluence of the accompanying radial veins here, but no bridge to the cephalic vein, so this is removed later. During the dissection, the massive truncal adiposity leads to insufficiency of the tourniquet. The tourniquet is therefore released again after approx. 20 minutes of preparation time. Elevation of the graft without blood lock without any problems. All-round vitality of the graft and regular blood supply to the hand until the graft is removed. Subsequent careful wound inspection. Hemostasis. Careful, two-layer wound closure and insertion of the full-thickness skin graft lifted from the right thigh. Subsequent application of the vacuum pump and application of the Kramer splint in the functional position and repositioning of the arm. Removal of the full-thickness skin graft: This is done in the case of pronounced fatty degeneration of the trunk. Removal of a full-thickness skin graft measuring approx. 16 x 8 cm. Resection of protruding, extremely large ......... fatty tissue. Resection of subcutaneous fatty tissue until multi-layer wound closure is possible without problems under moderate tension conditions. Prior to this, insertion of a 10 Redon drain. The graft is then inserted transorally and transcervically: this is laborious due to the size of the defect, but is ultimately successful with good reconstruction of the soft palate and extensive pharyngectomy. Reconstruction of the base and edge of the tongue. Regular check of fit and integrity. Subsequent conditioning of the flap vessels. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein, which has excellent flow close to the outlet. Perform the arterial anastomosis with 8-0 Ethilon. This succeeds adequately. Immediate regular venous return flow with regular graft perfusion. Measurement of a size 3.5 coupler and insertion of the venous anastomosis with the coupler system. Subsequently, regular flow and excellent flap vitality. Subsequently, to protect against kinking, circumscribed suture fixation of the stalk course. Subsequent insertion of a guided 10 Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Repositioning of the patient and completion of the procedure at this point without any indication of complications. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g, which should be continued for at least 2 to 3 days postoperatively. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected at least cT3 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right with locally aggressive and extensive submucosal growth. Transcervical, complete removal of the basal tumor area. Postoperatively, please perform an X-ray gruel swallow on the 8th to 9th postoperative day with regular flap vitality. Due to the muscular deficit, prolonged swallowing rehabilitation is to be expected.","Tumor resection, Free flap coverage (Radial), Bilateral neck dissection

The base of the tongue is unremarkable on inspection and palpation. Inspection of the oral cavity. Inconspicuous vestibulum oris, tongue also inconspicuous on inspection and palpation. Left glossotonsillar groove unremarkable. Soft palpation of the floor of the mouth. Now inspection of the oropharynx. Left tonsil region unremarkable, posterior pharyngeal wall smooth. Inspection of the right anterior palatal arch reveals an approx. 1.5 cm large, whitish deposit, coarse, palpable. The glossotonsillar groove does not appear to be involved in the process on palpation. Tonsil slightly coarse on the right, but not primarily tumor-suspect. Inspection of the nasopharynx using 70° optics, showing inconspicuous mucosal conditions. All findings are reproduced and confirmed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Performing the esophagogastroscopy: Easy insertion of the flexible endoscope into the esophagus and visualization of the esophagus into the stomach, where a regular folded relief can be seen. After distension of the stomach, more detailed inspection of the mucosa. This appears atrophic overall. No evidence of ulcer or tumor growth. After aspiration of the insufflated air, careful reflection and examination of the esophageal mucosa. A slightly hypertrophic mucosa was found in the area of the esophagogastric junction, otherwise the mucosal conditions in the rest of the esophagus were unremarkable. Decision by <CLINICIAN_NAME> to perform an excisional biopsy of the suspected tumor lesion as a right-sided tonsillectomy. Tumor resection through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Insertion of the oral spatula. The tumor in the area of the anterior palatal arch on the right is carefully excised with a safety margin of 0.5 cm. The anterior palatal arch falls, resection up to the alveolar ridge, the periosteum remains covered by soft tissue. In addition, a small part of the base of the tongue is removed. The posterior palatal arch remains completely intact. The excision also includes careful removal of the tonsil. Bipolar coagulation of the lower tonsil pole and finally separation of the complete preparation. This is sent to histology marked with a thread. Macroscopically, the tumor appears to be removed from the healthy tissue. An additional lateral margin sample is taken in the area of the alveolar ridge. Hemostasis with H202 swab and bipolar coagulation. Recheck of the surgical site, no source of bleeding visible. Conclusion: cT1 cN0 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. The specimen was thread-marked and sent for histologic processing. Macroscopically, the tumor appeared to be removed in healthy tissue; if the histological situation is also R0, neck dissection can be omitted according to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Wait for the histolog.

After appropriate preparation, oropharyngoscopy is performed once again: the ulcerated tumor can be seen here, which appears to be limited to the tonsil but extends laterally on palpation. Insertion of the PEG tube After entering the stomach and postoperative diaphanoscopy, the tube is inserted under visualization. This is done without any problems. Application of a wound dressing. Infiltration with local anesthetic in the neck area. Performing the tracheostomy: To do this, sharply cut through the skin and subcutaneous fatty tissue. Push apart the prelaryngeal muscles, undermine the isthmus of the thyroid gland and expose the pretracheal lamina. Then opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp and easy reintubation of the patient. Placement of the lower stoma sutures for mucocutaneous anastomosis. Then sterile washing and draping of the neck, arm and right thigh. Start with the neck dissection on the right side. Here, while protecting all non-lymphatic structures, regions I to V are evacuated after exposure and skeletonization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Neurolysis of the accessorius and hypoglossal nerves and re-embedding of the nerves. The superior thyroid, lingual and facial arteries are then exposed at their exit from the external carotid artery, thus shifting the external carotid artery laterally until the tumor can be safely bypassed. The lingual artery on the right side cannot be preserved as it runs through the middle of the tumor, so it is removed. The hypoglossal nerve is completely skeletonized and can be preserved until the end. On palpation, the tumor extends to just above the hyoid bone. The pharynx is then opened caudal to the tumor and cranial to the hyoid bone in the area of the lateral hypopharyngeal wall. The tumor is then successively developed completely from the transcervical side under visual control and resected with an appropriate safety margin. Histology is then taken from the mucosal margins. These are all found to be tumor-free on frozen section histology. Subsequent measurement of the defect with a 7 x 5.5 cm defect. Transition to neck dissection of the left side. This is performed in the same way as on the right side after visualization and skeletonization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, including displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the accessory nerve and hypoglossus. Here too, all non-lymphatic structures are spared and regions II to V are removed. Closure of the left side of the neck using multi-layered sutures after insertion of a Redon suction drain. Application of a pressure dressing. Elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap boundaries (7 x 5.5 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the pronator quadratus and flexor pollicis longus muscles with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vascular clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Covering of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. After appropriate development of the radial lobe graft, it is inserted transcervically into the defect. The radialis flap is then sutured transorally into the right oropharynx. The last caudal sutures in the area of the base of the tongue and the lateral hypopharyngeal wall are performed transcervically, resulting in complete tension-free closure of the defect. Check again transorally. The two anastomoses are then performed. First, the arterial anastomosis is performed after appropriate preliminary preparation of the superior thyroid artery. The large caliber vein, which accommodates the superficial as well as the deep drainage area of the flap, is attached to the internal jugular vein in an end-to-side anastomosis. No bleeding visible on final check with vital graft. Insertion of a Redon suction drain as well as an Easy-Flow drain. Multi-layer wound closure on the right cervical side. Application of a pressure dressing. Control of the flap transorally, whereby the graft is absolutely vital. Re-intubation of the patient onto an 8-gauge Rügheimer cannula, which is fixed to the skin. Application of a neck bandage. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Conclusion: Transcervical resection of a tonsillar carcinoma on the right side with selective neck dissection on both sides. Defect coverage via a microvascularly anastomosed radial artery flap graft from the left forearm. The arterial anastomosis is made via the superior thyroid artery. The venous anastomosis forms an end-to-side anastomosis to the internal jugular vein. Defect coverage on the left forearm via a split-thickness skin graft from the right thigh.

Intraoperative cT2 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. The immediate preoperative ultrasound showed a cN1 neck status.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, the patient is positioned. First, the tumor is inspected enorally. An exophytic tumor is seen in the area of the right tonsil with macroscopically clearly carcinomatous extensions towards the soft palate to the right parauvular region. Partly island-like tumor growth. The tumor extends towards the buccal and alveolar ridge, does not reach the maxilla. No deep infiltration of the soft tissues of the cheek, superficial growth also in the area of the alveolar ridge. The dorsal floor of the mouth is infiltrated via the glossotonsillar groove and the posterior floor of the mouth, also submucosal tumor growth towards the edge of the tongue. The right edge of the tongue is infiltrated over approximately half the length, approximately Ľ deep infiltration. Tumor growth to just before the posterior palatal arch. The posterior pharyngeal wall is free, as is the caudal pharyngeal side wall towards the entrance to the piriform sinus. Overall, the extent is clearly cT3. PEG insertion is performed first. This is done with the gastroscope. Careful endoscopy into the stomach. With excellent diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. The patient is then prepared for definitive tumor resection. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. First start with transoral resection. The tumor is completely marked and cut around with a safety margin of approx. 1 cm in the area of the oral cavity and 1.5 cm in the area of the tongue. All suspicious mucosal changes localized in the marginal area are removed. This results in a subtotal resection of the soft palate. Removal towards the upper jaw and soft cheek parts. Exposure of the pterygoid muscles. Clearly safe and free tissue conditions in depth. Incision of the alveolar mucosa. This is done sharply down to the bone. Detachment of the mucosa with removal of the periosteum. Resection of the posterior floor of the mouth. Resection of the right edge of the tongue. Resection up to the base of the tongue. Total approx. Ľ resection of the tongue. Part of the submandibular gland is removed transorally in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth to maintain a safety margin. The lingual nerve must also be resected during tumor resection. With macroscopic in sano resection of the tumor, marginal specimens are taken from the specimen that completely depict the primary tumor. These are completely resected as tumor-free in the frozen section diagnosis, therefore an overall R0 situation can be assumed here. The graft is now measured. The neck dissections are then carried out. The neck dissection of the right side and the tracheotomy were performed in parallel with the graft elevation from the left forearm. The neck dissection of the left side is performed first. To do this, make a curved skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid and digastric muscles. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Free dissection of the internal jugular vein with exposure and preservation of the facial vein. Dissection of the anterior neck preparation with careful preservation of the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerves. Subsequent release of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. No caudal evidence of lymphatic leakage. Clinically no highly suspicious masses on the left side. After careful wound inspection, after wound irrigation, with dry wound conditions and insertion of a 10 Redon drainage, careful, two-layer wound closure. Subsequent repositioning for neck dissection on the opposite side. The procedure is basically the same here. Skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid and digastric muscles. Clearing out the anterior neck preparation while carefully protecting the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. A facial vein is not developed here. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Complete dissection of the internal jugular vein. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Evacuation of level V while protecting the cervical plexus branches. Level II revealed a lymph node measuring approx. 2 x 2 cm, round and therefore suspicious, otherwise subcapsular release of the submandibular gland. Resection of the remaining gland after, as described above, resection already by transoral resection. Careful release of level I b, here several lymph nodes measuring up to 1 ˝ cm. Now resection of the digastric muscle. Overall, a relatively wide shaft is now created enorally, approx. 3 transverse fingers wide. Careful wound irrigation and wound inspection. First turn to the plastic tracheotomy. To do this, make a skin incision at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Cut through the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring. First creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap, this is relatively vulnerable, therefore a tracheal window is created. The trachea is then sutured in the usual manner using the back-stitch technique. Subsequently, intubation is first changed to a Woodbridge tube and later to a size 8 low cuff cannula. The radialis graft is then lifted from the left forearm. After the graft has already been measured enorally with a special soft palate and tongue edge configuration, a graft measuring up to 10 x 10 cm is marked. Positioning over the radial artery while protecting the retinaculum. Application of the tourniquet. Radial incision of the graft, taking the cephalic vein with it. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the superficial radial nerve ramus and preservation of the complete nerve in its course. Ulnar visualization of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. Identification of the distal vascular pedicle. Removal of the vascular pedicle after ligation. Strictly subfascial release with clipping of distal pedicle branches. Proximal dissection. Exposure of the ulnar artery. Exposure of the radial vein and artery. Exposure of the common interosseous artery. It is now apparent that the cephalic vein does not have a pronounced connection to the deep venous system, therefore several strong accompanying veins are elevated in relation to the graft. A total of 4 graft veins were elevated. After reopening the tourniquet, regular hand perfusion and excellent graft perfusion. Careful hemostasis of the graft and forearm. Subsequent removal of the vital graft after ligation of the feeding and draining vessels. The graft is then carefully implanted transorally. Overall good fit and intact conditions on all sides. Overall, somewhat laborious insertion conditions due to the size of the defect. In conclusion, however, a good result. Transcervical pedicle positioning. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery. There is also a superior thyroid vein and the strong external jugular vein. After conditioning the flap vessels, perform the arterial anastomosis with Ethilon 8-0. Subsequently, create tight relationships. Select 2 strong, returning venous vessels. Anastomosis of a vein to the stump of the superior thyroid vein. Also anastomosis to the external jugular vein. Subsequent regular graft perfusion. Regular flow from the vessels with a positive smear test, so that a 10 Redon drain is inserted on the right cervical side if the graft perfusion is regular. Subsequent careful, two-layer wound closure. Now to the treatment of the left forearm. First, careful, two-layer wound closure after final wound inspection. Then insertion of the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the right groin. Careful trimming of the full-thickness skin. Final good fit. Subsequent application of a hydrogel and Mepilex dressing and application of the stretcher splint functional position. Now for full-thickness skin harvesting from the right groin. Trimming of a piece of full-thickness skin measuring approx. 14 x 10 cm. Strict cutaneous lifting. Final thinning of the graft. Subsequent extensive subcutaneous mobilization down to the abdominal fascia and the fascia lata. Careful hemostasis. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure under very low tension conditions. Final inspection and completion of the procedure with a vital graft, without any indication of complications. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT3 cN1 G2 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Defect reconstruction using a microvascular anastomosed radialis graft. Postoperatively, please carry out an X-ray gruel swallow on the 8th to 9th postoperative day, after which a diet can be set up depending on swallowing function.","Transoral tumor resection, Neck dissection, PEG placement, Free flap coverage (Radial), Tracheotomy

Extension transglottic on the right. In the area of the anterior commissure, extending to the left side up to at least 1/3 of the left vocal fold macroscopically. No evidence of thyroid cartilage infiltration on CT. Therefore indication for the above mentioned operation.","First of all, MLE again: The tumor described appears, which extends slightly from supraglottic to nasoglottic, over the anterior commissure to the left and down to just under half of the left vocal fold. Therefore indication for the above mentioned surgery. First attempt at PEG insertion: Pre-mirroring of the esophagoscope into the stomach. Even after several attempts, diaphanoscopy could not be achieved, so that the PEG placement seemed too risky. A feeding tube is therefore inserted. Tracheostoma placement: The thyroid isthmus is exposed via the caudal end of the zigzag incision. This is clamped off and supplied using puncture ligatures. Enter the inter-cartilaginous space between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a wide-stemmed Björk flap. Now repositioning for tracheostomy and fronto-lateral partial laryngeal resection: injection of a total of 20 ml xylocaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck and prelaryngeally. Prelaryngeal zigzag incision leading into the tracheostomy. Expose the infrahyoid muscles. Push off the soft tissue. Splitting of the infrahyoid musculature. Section paramedian left through the perichondrium to the thyroid cartilage. Dissection of the soft tissue from the laryngeal skeleton on both sides down to the cricoid cartilage. Thyrofissure with the wheel saw, sawing out a triangle that begins just below the incision. This is followed by dissection of the perichondrium from the remaining thyroid cartilage on both sides. No tumor infiltrates as already described in the CT are visible here either. Entering the larynx cranially. Overview of the tumor. Overview also relatively difficult via direct view, so that the tumor is finally transected medially. The tumor can now also be seen with a good overview of its subglottic extension. The tumor is initially removed on the left with a safety margin of several mm on all sides, whereby the resection is also carried out slightly subglottically. Resection also includes 2/3 of the left vocal fold including the ventriculus laryngeus and parts of the pocket fold. On the right, the tumor was also macroscopically resected with a safety margin of several mm on all sides. Here, a clear part of the subglottic area was resected. The resection extends to the arytenoid cartilage, which is partially resected. The cranial pocket fold is also resected. Caudally, the upper edge of the cricoid cartilage is exposed. Both specimens are marked with sutures and sent for frozen section. Margin samples from the arytenoid region, from the interary region to the left and from the lateral and cranial sides are also sent in. Preparation on the left completely healthy. On the right, subglottic to cranial and in the arytenoid region not in healthy tissue. Also marginal specimen in the interary region with CIS and marginal specimen cranial with CIS, also marginal specimen in the arytenoid region with CIS. Therefore, a 5-6 mm wide strip is resected again subglottically, covering the entire mucosa from the left paramedian to the posterior wall. This is thread-marked to the frozen section. No more infiltrates in the frozen section. A resection is also taken from the cranial area with a subsequent marginal sample. No more infiltrates in the frozen section. A resection is taken from the interary area as well as a further marginal sample, which extends to the left arytenoid cartilage. Here, mild to moderate dysplasia, but no CIS. Another extensive marginal sample is sent in from the ary area, which again includes parts of the arytenoid cartilage and surrounding soft tissue. Still carcinoma in situ infiltrates here. Another marginal sample is therefore sent in. This includes all cartilage and soft tissue parts up to the upper edge of the cricoid cartilage up to the mucosa of the postcricoid region, which, however, remains intact. The remaining marginal sample is sent for final diagnosis. If this marginal sample is positive, a laryngectomy is probably unavoidable for oncological reasons. Mucosa from the postcricoid region is sutured to the cricoid cartilage with two 3.0 Vicryl sutures to improve epithelialization. Subsequently, remnants of the pocket ligament are fixed to the left side of the thyroid cartilage via a drill hole. The thyroid cartilage is readapted cranially via drill holes. Perichondrium with attached soft tissue is successively adapted with Vicryl 4.0 single button sutures until complete soft tissue closure over the cartilage is achieved. The infrahyoid musculature is then sutured over the perichondrium. The wound is closed in layers with epithelialization of the previously inserted tracheostoma. A 9 mm tracheostomy tube is then inserted. Neck dissection on both sides: Beginning with the right side: Curved incision in front of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissection of the fat lymph node package. Exposure of V. jugularis interna, exposure of A. carotis communis, A. carotis interna, A. carotis externa and A. thyroidea superior. Visualization of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. Successive development of the anterior neck preparation with visualization and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve and superior thyroid artery. Subsequent development of the dorsal neck preparation with preservation of the branches of the cervical plexus. In level 2, cranial lymph nodes clearly suspected of malignancy. Neck dissection is then performed on the left side: in principle, this is performed in the same way as on the right side. The structures mentioned are also visualized. Levels 2-4 are evacuated. Irrigation of the entire wound area on both sides and careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain in each case. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Intraoperatively started antibiotic treatment with clindamycin should be continued for at least 1 week with 4 x 300 mg/die. Wait for final histology. If residual histology from the right arytenoid region is tumor-free, radiation therapy should be discussed postoperatively in the residual laryngeal region. In the case of extensive resection in the arytenoid region, dysfunction of the swallowing function and protracted swallowing rehabilitation are to be expected, so this should be initiated as early as possible. In addition, control MLE should be performed in approx. 3 months. If histology in the arytenoid region continues to show carcinoma, a residual laryngectomy cannot be avoided for oncological reasons. The patient should then undergo speech rehabilitation.","Partial laryngeal resection (Leroux-Robert), Neck dissection

Incise it and lift it above the hyoid bone. Then expose the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A metastasis can be seen in region IV, which is partially attached to the muscle and also appears to be firmly connected to the vein. Opening of the vascular nerve sheath and protection of the artery and vagus nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. This shows that the metastasis cannot be dissected from the vein wall in a healthy layer. Therefore, expose the vein caudally and cranially under the digaster muscle. Deposition of the vein there. Subsequent partial resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle together with the metastasis left on the vein. The following neck dissection is completed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Neck dissection on the left (<CLINICIAN_NAME>/PJ): Showing the borders of the neck dissection planned from level II to V. The submandibular gland is shown here, the posterior venter of the digaster, the hypoglossal nerve, the accessorius nerve, the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, cervical plexus, cervical vascular sheath with the internal jugular vein, the external and internal carotid arteries, the omohyoid muscle was dissected to the detachment of the larynx. The neck preparation is now dissected and removed, preserving the non-lymphatic structures from level II to V. Punctual hemostasis. Placement of a 10 Redon drain. Exposure and protection of the nervus accessorius and nervus hypoglossus until the end. Then dissection and removal of the superior thyroid artery and dissection of the carotid artery medially and detachment from the laryngeal skeleton. Cranial exposure of the lateral horn of the hyoid bone and removal of the suprahyoid musculature up to the middle. Then cut through the straight neck muscles on the thyroid gland. Then pass under the isthmus and ligate on both sides so that the anterior trachea is clearly exposed. Opening of the trachea between the 3rd and 4th tracheal clasp with insertion of an LE tube. Then dissection of the right thyroid lobe laterally. Now transition to the opposite side. In principle, the procedure is similar here. The only difference is that all non-lymphatic structures are preserved here. Dissection of the large caliber lingual artery and facial artery for subsequent anastomosis. After appropriate detachment of the laryngeal skeleton, the epiglottis is completely freed of mucosa ventrally up to the upper edge of the glottis. There the mucosa is incised and the entrance into the pharynx is made. The tumor on the right side of the hypopharynx is directly visible. First, release the larynx on the left side along the epiglottis, leaving out the previously released piriform sinus. The hypopharynx is then successively removed at a distance of about 1.5 cm from the tumor. After uniting the incisions from both sides postcricoidally and detaching the larynx caudally under the cricoid while preparing a caudally pedicled mucosal flap for the subsequent Herrmann chimney, the larynx together with the right hypopharynx is removed in toto. Subsequently, marginal sections are taken from the resulting mucosal margins, all of which are found to be free of tumor and dysplasia in the frozen section histological examination. Then completion of the Herrmann chimney by suturing the mucosal flap to the upper tracheal clasp. Subsequent myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle. Insertion of a Provox-Vega voice prosthesis. Again, completion of the neck dissection on the left side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Neck dissection on the right (<CLINICIAN_NAME>/PJ): Showing the borders of the nervus accessorius, cervical vascular sheath, omohyoid muscle, which was cut to detach the larynx, glandula submandibularis, venter posterior of the digaster. The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is exposed after creation of the apron flap. There is a metastasis in level IV, which cannot be dissected from the internal jugular vein. After demonstrating the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the decision is made to remove the internal jugular vein. The jugular vein is thus integrated into the preparation. Exposure of the vagus nerve, exposure of the common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery. All of the above structures can be spared. Release of the neck preparation of level II a, II b, III, IV and V. Punctual hemostasis and placement of a 10 Redon drainage. The ALT flap is then applied on the right side with a size of 4 x 9 cm. After Doppler sonographic visualization of the perforators, the flap is outlined and incised caudally medially down to the muscle fascia. Expose the muscle septum with medialization of the vastus medialis muscle. Then widen the incision cranially so that the vascular pedicle is clearly visible. Then cut around the flap medially cranially and caudally laterally. Finally, the stalk is also exposed distally at the end of the flap and removed. The flap is thus successively developed cranially with a muscle cuff. Finally, fine dissection of the pedicle is performed, whereby the vein and artery are exposed as far as their exit from the circumflex femoral artery. Once the neck dissection is complete, the flap is removed, rinsed with heparin solution and transferred to the neck. There the reconstruction of the hypopharynx is performed using single-button sutures. The flap is then anastomosed to the lingual artery on the left side and to the internal jugular vein. Conclusion: Hypopharyngeal/laryngeal carcinoma on the right with total laryngectomy with hemipharyngectomy, primary voice rehabilitation by implantation of a Provox voice prosthesis, pharyngeal reconstruction with a microvascularly anastomosed ALT flap from the right thigh, radical neck dissection on the right and selective neck dissection on the left, PEG placement.","Total laryngectomy, Tracheotomy, Provox Prosthesis

Histological confirmation of a papillary carcinoma in situ as part of a panendoscopy and sampling on <2016> in domo. There is now an indication for resection. In addition, at the beginning of the operation, an approx. 1 cm large, flat, whitish thickened mass was noticed on the underside of the tongue on the front left, which was also removed. The indication for the above-mentioned procedure is therefore given.","First bring the patient into the operating room and actively identify the patient. Then carry out the team time-out. Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. The surgeon now positions the patient. Inspection and palpation of the oral cavity and tongue. As described above, there is a 1 cm large mass on the underside of the tongue on the left anterior side. Furthermore, the papillomatous mass on the glossotonsillar fold on the right side measuring approx. 2 x 1 cm. Directly anterior to this, clearly hyperkeratotic, leukoplakically altered underside of the tongue and tongue surface in the posterior third of the tongue reaching up to the gingiva, which appears suspicious and is directly related to the papillomatous mass. Therefore, excision of the papillomatous mass with the leukoplakic mucosal change in toto. Marking using bipolar. Subsequent excision in toto using a monopolar needle. Several marginal samples are taken (surface of the tongue, undersurface of the tongue, posteriorly and at the base of the wound). Excision of the mass on the anterior underside of the tongue and, after bipolar hemostasis, suturing in this area. After one hour, the frozen section is made: Here, high-grade dysplasia is seen focally in the posterior margin. Therefore, a large incision (2 x 1 cm) is made here and then a marginal sample is sent for final histology. The result is an approx. 5 x 3 cm wound area on the right posterior third of the tongue, soft palate, tonsil lobe and gingiva. Only anterior adaptation of the wound edges using individual Vicryl 3.0 SH sutures. Subsequent bipolar hemostasis and, under dry conditions, completion of the operation without complications.

Identification of the midline and linea alba. Separation of the infrahyoid muscles. Visualization of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining and mobilization of the thyroid isthmus cranially. Exposure of the middle cervical fascia. An opening of the trachea between the 3rd and 4th tracheal cartilage in the sense of a visor tracheotomy is performed. The tracheal edges are fixed with several sutures to the lower and upper skin. Insertion of a size 8 tracheal cannula. In the meantime, the results are communicated by the pathology colleague. Anterior commissure and caudal margin to the subglottis are described as tumor-free. Questionable infiltration towards the back. Acceptance of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. A resection is performed in the area of the arytaenoid. Two strips of tissue are removed here. The first is removed from the arytenoid caudally and anteriorly practically up to the anterior commissure. The second is taken from the area of the middle arythenoid on the left. Both samples are sent for final histology. Hemostasis using monopolar coagulation and suprarenin-soaked swabs. End of the surgical procedure without complications. The patient is handed over to the anesthesia colleagues. Conclusion: Endoscopic transoral laser resection for a cT1b (predominantly left) glottic carcinoma. Additional temporary tracheostomy. Intraoperative frozen section diagnosis is described as tumor-free in the anterior commissure and subglottic area. In case of questionable infiltrations in the area of the arytaenoid, 2 marginal samples are taken. Please leave the blockable cannula in place for 5 days. Decannulation should be considered depending on the course of the procedure. Diet build-up from the 1st postoperative day. If there is significant clinical swallowing, a nasogastric tube should be inserted. Cannula change possible from the 2nd postoperative day.

A panendoscopy performed <2014> showed no evidence of primarius. CT also showed no reliable evidence of primarius with extensive, growing metastasis. Sonographically also conspicuous left cervical lymph nodes.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, another pharyngoscopy/laryngoscopy is performed to search for the primary ear. After inspection of the inconspicuous oral vestibule, the small bore tube is inserted under dental protection. Inspection and palpation of the oral cavity, which is also unremarkable. Now inspection of the oropharynx. This is inconspicuous, especially in the area of the tonsil regions and the base of the tongue. Adjustment of the endolarynx and the subglottic region. No evidence of primarius here either. With an inconspicuous esophageal entrance and left piriform sinus, a circumscribed, centrally ulcerated lesion measuring approx. 1 to 1.5 cm with a raised marginal wall is found in the area of the medial wall of the right piriform sinus. A representative sample is taken and a frozen section is made. This shows a basaloid, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, thus confirming the primary. Due to the extensive metastasis extending close to the pharyngeal wall, primary transcervical resection is indicated. The PEG tube is then inserted. This is done with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy to see through to the stomach. Here, with excellent diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach. The PEG tube is then inserted using the usual thread pull-through method. The patient is then positioned. First turn to the neck dissection on the right side. Here the lymph node metastasis has grown extensively into the skin and is partially open. Incision around the skin area with a safety margin. Separation of the skin and extension of the skin incision cranially and caudally. Separation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the case of extensive infiltration. Exposure of the internal jugular vein and removal. In the case of clear cranial infiltration, expose and secure the common carotid artery and vagus nerve. Later resection of the omohyoid muscle. Cranial dissection of the metastasis with subtotal involvement of the cervical plexus roots. Inclusion of paravertebral musculature. Resection on all sides in .............. Infiltration of the submandibular gland, which is also resected. Here also clear infiltration and subsequent resection of the ramus marginalis mandibulae. Detachment of the metastasis on the mandible, taking the periosteum with it, no infiltration here. The accessor nerve is no longer visible in the case of extensive infiltration. Infiltration of the soft tissue up to the paralaryngeal area. Clear infiltration of the hypoglossal nerve, cranial also infiltration of the lingual nerve, but here no enoral growth. Careful dissection in the area of the carotid bulb, here the external carotid artery can be seen walled in by tumor tissue shortly after the exit. Skeletonization of the external carotid artery. Tumor tissue is clearly visible on the vessel, so here it is removed as far as possible at the bulb, here taking a marginal sample, but without the possibility of further resection. Careful free dissection and protection of the internal carotid artery, which is in contact with the tumor over a long distance, here also no further possibility for resection, but also no reliable indication of tumor invasion, therefore RX situation at this point. Cranial dissection, separation of the internal jugular vein cranially. Separation of the digastric muscle during infiltration and resection of the metastasis macroscopically in toto. If there is close contact with the cranial part of the skin, a resection is performed here, otherwise in sano conditions on all sides in the area of the skin. The resectate is sent for definitive histology. Later clearing of the transition from level I b to level I a, here further macroscopically clearly conspicuous nodules. The focus is now turned to the primary tumor region. Circumscribed skeletonization of the laryngeal skeleton. Entering the lateral pharyngeal wall, widening, exposing the piriform sinus. Release of the piriform sinus. Now a good overview of the tumor tissue. Cut around with a safety margin. Defect of the medial piriform sinus wall measuring approx. 2 x 2 cm in total. Resection defect up to the anterior piriform sinus wall, otherwise intact mucosa on all sides. The resectate is sent in thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics and appears R0-resected on the specimen. If the mucosa is sufficient and healthy, the primary closure of the pharyngotomy is performed, followed by relining with muscle tissue. Now neck dissection on the left. To do this, make a skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland with removal of the caudal capsule. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the facial vein, the cervical vein, the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Overall, macroscopically conspicuous nodules on the vein. Exposure of the accessor nerve. Protection of the nerve and clearing of the accessorius triangle. Clearing of level V up to the transition to V b with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches, here some enlarged nodes, but not necessarily suspicious macroscopically. Finally, careful wound inspection and, in dry wound conditions, after wound irrigation with Ringer's solution, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Subsequently turn to tracheotomy, due to the extended radical neck dissection of the right side and potentially considerable risk of swelling due to the extent of the lymph node dissection. Horizontal skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Exposure and transection of the infrahyoid muscles and exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring and subsequent insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Subsequent easy transfer to a size 8 low-cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. At the same time, a pectoralis major flap was elevated from the right. After measuring the cutaneous defect in the area of the right neck skin, a 9 x 5 cm area of skin was lifted. Paramammary, broad-based lifting with subtotal lifting of the pectoralis major muscle. Careful subfascial release of the muscle. Exposure of the pectoralis minor muscle. Identification of the pedicle vessel and, while protecting the pedicle vessel, elevation of the flap, cranial tunneling and tension-free insertion into the neck defect, relining of the pharynx, the pharyngeal suture and adequate coverage of the neck skin afterwards. Insertion of 10 Redon drains and careful, strong, multi-layered wound closure. Subsequent completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperatively confirmed and R0-resected cT1 hypopharyngeal carcinoma in the area of the medial piriform sinus wall on the right as primary in cN3 neck status right, here extended radical neck dissection with resection of the external carotid artery, the hypoglossal nerve, the ramus marginalis mandibulae, the lingual nerve and the border cord. Due to the long-distance contact with no possibility of resection in the area of the internal carotid artery, an RX situation can be assumed in the cervical area, which is why adjuvant therapy should be escalated here. Postoperatively, please perform an X-ray gruel swallow on the 10th day, followed by decannulation depending on the current prognostically unclear swallowing function.","Pharyngeal partial resection, Neck dissection, Pedicled flap (Pectoralis major), Tracheotomy

Overall, after completion of the diagnostics, cT2 cN2b cM tongue margin carcinoma on the right in the area of the underside of the tongue or the anterior floor of the mouth on the right. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was recommended.","First inspection of the primary tumor region after transnasal intubation and preparation by the anesthesia colleagues. Positioning of the patient. The ulcerated tumor described above is seen in the area of the underside of the tongue and the anterior floor of the mouth on the right side with a largely endophytic tumor component and complete fixation of the underside of the tongue on the right side corresponding to the preoperative clinic. No infiltration of the alveolar ridge. No infiltration of the left-sided floor of the mouth. The tumor is now cut around with a safety margin of a good 1 cm in the area of the anterior alveolar ridge. Here, the mucosa is pushed away from the bone, otherwise wide in sano resection in the area of the tongue, growth towards the outer muscles of the floor of the mouth, but these are not infiltrated. Exposure of the muscles of the floor of the mouth, no direct contact with the metastasis in level I on the right side. Macroscopic and palpatory in sano resection of the tumor, which is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics and is resected in sano on the specimen. Scarce area basally towards the tip of the tongue with otherwise clearly in sano resection. For this reason, a resection is performed here to extend the safety margin, which is then used for definitive histology so that a safe in sano resection is finally available. Measurement of the defect. Turn first to the neck dissection and tracheotomy. Start with the right side. Submandibular incision. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation and dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland and exposure of the digastric muscle. This reveals a moderately displaceable, high-suspecting mass located in front of the submandibular gland, which lies against the mandible but still shows some displacement here. Exposure and dissection of the facial vein, which drains into the anterior jugular vein and the internal jugular vein. Excision of the submandibular gland, including level Ib, here some small but coarse and therefore conspicuous nodules. For resection of the metastasis, incision on the mandible on the periosteum. Push off the periosteum. However, the metastasis can be detached here. Deposition of the anterior venter of the digastric muscle if there is clear infiltration. Also circumscribed infiltration of the anterior floor of the mouth. Therefore clear perinodal spread here. En bloc entrainment, here from level Ia. Hypoglossal nerve, lingual nerve, lingual artery and facial artery can be preserved. Now free preparation of the internal jugular vein after exposure of the accessorius nerve. Dissection of the accessorius triangle and dissection of level V while carefully preserving the cervical plexus branches and exposing the common carotid artery and vagus nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein reveals a highly visible mass on the common carotid artery extending anteriorly into the jugulofacial angle. Careful dissection of the vein. There is a circumscribed infiltration of the mouth of the facial vein. This is therefore removed. The vessel to the anterior jugular vein is also removed. Complete and expose the internal jugular vein while maintaining cranial continuity and completing the neck dissection. The tunnel is created enorally. Create a tunnel measuring approx. 3 QF for stem positioning. Approach the neck dissection on the left side. Here also submandibular incision, cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue, exposing and cutting through the platysma. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and preservation of the external jugular vein and on the opposite side. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland, taking the capsule with it. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Free preparation and preservation of the facial vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful exposure and protection of the cervical artery of the superior thyroid and the hypoglossal nerve and preservation of the facial nerve draining into the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Complete according to level V, exploration of the sonographically described mass in level Vb. An oval, but rough and therefore suspicious mass measuring approx. 1 cm is actually found here. This is extirpated and level Vb is completed. Careful treatment of some leaking lymphatic fluid. Finally, absolutely dry conditions. Even after multiple inspections, the wound is finally irrigated, followed by insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. The tracheotomy is then performed in the case of post-thyroidectomy. Horizontal incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring, forming a horizontal visor tracheotomy. Subsequent suturing of the mucocutaneous anastomosis, later problem-free reintubation on a low cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. The defect is then measured. After tumor resection, this resulted in resection of the anterior third or anterior half of the right-sided tongue and resection of the anterior floor of the mouth. Due to the slender proportions, the decision was made to elevate and cover the defect with an anterolateral transfemoral graft. After doppler sonographic identification of the main perforator and marking of the anatomical landmarks, doppler sonographic identification of 2 secondary perforators, marking of the graft measuring a total of 6 x 8 cm with a special mouth floor configuration. Subsequent medial incision, cutting of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and securing of the rectus femoris muscle. Subcutaneous release while protecting the vascularized intermuscular septum. Performing a release incision after identifying the pedicle vessels. An oblique branch running steeply caudally and a further upper oblique branch can be seen. Identification of the main perforator with musculocutaneous course. Dissection of the main perforator. Initially, it can be seen that one of the secondary perforators extends from the main perforator; later, during dissection, the second secondary perforator can also be seen extending from the main perforator. After tracing the perforator, it can be seen to extend from the oblique upper vessel, leaving a small muscle cuff at the outlet of the perforator. Complete cutting of the graft after preparation of the vascular pedicle. Conditioning of the pedicle vessels and removal of the vital graft. Careful hemostasis in the area of the leg. Subsequent insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure with resection of excess skin. The graft is then incorporated transorally. This succeeds well and with sufficient volume filling in the area of the tip of the tongue and the missing lateral tongue. Positioning of the pedicle vessels, conditioning of the superior thyroid artery. Performing the arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. Subsequent conditioning of the graft vein. Performing a venous anastomosis with the Coupler system on the superior thyroid vein in the correct pedicle position and graft perfusion. Subsequently, regular graft perfusion and positive spreading phenomenon and regular pedicle pulsation, so that subsequent careful wound closure on the right cervical side, subsequent termination of the procedure without any indication of complications. Note: Due to the patient's documented refusal of a PEG tube, a nasogastric feeding tube was inserted. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with clindamycin, which should be continued for 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT2 oral floor carcinoma on the right side with a strikingly aggressive and discontinuous metastatic pattern. Intraoperative cN2c neck status possible, therefore prompt adjuvant therapy should be initiated here. If the graft heals properly, swallowing diagnostics can be started from the 7th to 8th postoperative day. The insertion of a PEG tube during the interval appears to be necessary.","Tumor resection, Partial glossectomy, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage

Now infiltrate the patient. There are no abnormalities in the glottis, subglottis and supraglottis. There are also no special features in the hypopharyngeal region on both sides or in the postcricoid region. Raising of the soft palate. Inspection of the nasopharynx: No special features here either. Now advance the flexible telescope into the stomach. Careful mirroring back. No special features in the area of the esophagus. Inspection of the oropharynx: Normal findings in the area of the oropharynx on the right side. No changes to the mucosa in the area of the tonsil or in the area of the right base of the tongue. Now inspection of the oropharynx on the left side. There is a clear induration of the tonsil in the area of the lower half, which corresponds to the CT findings. The tumor borders on the base of the tongue, but does not merge into the base of the tongue. Final inspection of the oral cavity. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions. All inspections with the aid of the endoscope or microscope. Now adjust with the tonsil retractor and expose the tumor. Now wide incision of the tonsil in the sense of a tumor tonsillectomy. Dissection towards the base of the tongue. In the area of the base of the tongue, remove the tissue adjacent to the tonsil. The tumor, which can be clearly defined by palpation, is incised in the healthy area, whereby the mucosa is also resected up to the middle of the pharynx. The tumor is removed in the area of the base of the tongue with careful hemostasis. The specimen is marked and sent as a whole for frozen section histology. <CLINICIAN_NAME> diagnoses the tonsil as the primary tumor on the one hand and a clear resection of the tumor in healthy tissue on the other. Careful hemostasis in the oropharynx area again. Insertion of a gastric tube. Repositioning of the patient. Abjode and cover the left neck. Then application of local anesthesia. Now skin incision from the mastoid to the clavicle. The scar made during the previous operation is included in the incision. Now cut through the subcutaneous tissue and cut through the platysma. In view of the previous operation, which took place 12 days ago, extremely difficult dissection conditions, particularly in the area of levels I, II and III. The tissue here is clearly caked. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the common carotid artery, exposure of the internal and external carotid artery, exposure of the branches of the external carotid artery. Visualization of the hypoglossal nerve. Visualization of the vagus nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Due to the previous operation, there is a pronounced conglomerate in the area of the upper venous angle. This conglomerate cannot be safely separated from the internal jugular vein under oncological aspects, so that a radical neck dissection, in the sense of a resection of the internal jugular vein, is performed. Separation of the internal jugular vein cranial to the inflow of the thyroid vein and dissection cranially. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Separation of the internal jugular vein below the base of the skull. Dissection of the facial vein and removal of the tumor conglomerate in the area of levels I, II and III. Now dissection in the area of levels IV and V after exposing the accessorius nerve and exposing the deep neck muscles and the phrenic nerve. The resection extends below the omohyoid muscle. This results in a radical neck dissection, whereby levels Ia, II, III, IV and V are included in the resection. Repositioning of the above-mentioned structures, which were removed from their beds during neurolysis and are repositioned in their beds at the end of the operation (vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve, accessory nerve, common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery). Rinse the neck with water and hydrogen. Careful hemostasis. Insertion of a Redon drain. Wound closure in layers. Now re-inspect the oral cavity. The resection bed is dry and free of irritation. Final discussion with the anesthetist, in the sense of a consultation. The patient is transferred to the recovery ward.","Tumor resection, Radical left neck dissection, Panendoscopy

Horizontal skin incision over 2 cm just below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection of the infralaryngeal muscles. Split the infralaryngeal muscles in the midline and dissect down to the cricoid cartilage. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus and sharp transection of the isthmus after bipolar coagulation. Identification of the anterior tracheal wall. Creation of a visor tracheotomy in the 2nd to 3rd intratracheal fissure. Insertion of an 8-gauge cannula after epithelialization of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Then tumor resection transorally by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: insertion of mouth retractor. Exposure of the tumor. The tumor is incised on all sides at a distance of at least 1.5 cm. This results in an almost complete hemiglossectomy. The sublingual gland is resected, as are larger parts of the floor of the mouth and larger parts of the base of the tongue. The preparation is sent in toto and thread-marked for a frozen section. Here all margins are healthy. Thus R0 resection. Subsequent neck dissection. The undersigned first performs the neck dissection on the left side after sterile washing and infiltration with local anesthetic containing adrenaline. This is followed by a skin incision along the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection of the platysma flap and fixation in the usual manner. Subsequent skeletonization of the vascular nerve sheath. Identification and protection of the hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. Evacuation of regions II to IV. There is no caliber or other type of facial vein. Subsequent evacuation of region I after submandibulectomy. This already creates a defect in the enoral direction, where the flap will be inserted later. Dissection of the digastric muscle at its tendon. Subsequent skeletonization of the superior thyroid artery, which will later be used for anastomosis. Then transition to the operation on the right side. In principle, the same procedure is used here. There are no clinically manifest lymph node metastases on either side. Elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (8 x 6 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris.

During the initial operation, a suspicious finding was found in the area of the left upper tonsil pole. Pathohistologically, however, there was no evidence of a primary tumor. Therefore, initially suspected CUP syndrome and therefore further appropriate CUP diagnostics. The subsequent PET-CT showed no evidence of further metastases in addition to the metastatic conglomerate on the left side. Only a slight increase in the area of the left tonsil. There is now an indication for a left tonsillectomy and frozen section diagnostics. In addition, a modified radical neck dissection on the left side is indicated. Due to the sonomorphologic cN2b neck status and the unremarkable cervical PET findings on the right, a neck dissection on the right side does not appear to be indicated. The patient consented to the planned procedure.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carry out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Induction of anesthesia and intubation of the patient. Start of tonsillectomy. Insertion of the McIvor oral spatula while protecting the teeth, lips and tongue. Grasping the tonsil and medializing it. Mucosal incision in the area of the fold at the anterior palatal arch. Exposure of the tonsil capsule. Successive dissection along the muscles of the anterior and posterior palatal arch. Exposure of the lower tonsil pole. Bipolar coagulation of the pole vessels. Separation of the tonsil at the lower left pole. This is sent in for frozen section diagnostics. Perform a mucosoplasty. In the meantime, reposition the patient for neck dissection on the left side. Superficial skin disinfection. Infiltration anesthesia. Ablation of the surgical site and sterile draping. Marking of the planned incision from the mastoid over the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, curving caudally. Cut sharply through the cutis and subcutis as well as the platysma. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle as the caudal border. Exposure, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the accessorius nerve and the posterior digastric nerve as the cranial border. Turning to the cervical vascular sheath and exposure of the internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery. Successive detachment of the pronounced metastatic conglomerate from the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A clear displacement layer is visible here, so that intraoperatively no infiltration of the muscle must be assumed. In region II, the jugular vein is adjacent to the metastatic conglomerate. After laborious blunt dissection, however, it can be seen that a displacement layer is also present here. The vein therefore does not appear to be infiltrated by tumor even in the cranial sections. Therefore, successive sharp and blunt dissection and detachment of the metastatic conglomerate from the internal jugular vein. Subsequent successive development of the neck preparation from level IIb via level IIa, III and IV. Palpation reveals further metastases in the deep level IV as well as in level V. Level IV and V are therefore also cleared. A prominent thoracic duct can also be seen in deep level IV. This is grasped and ligated several times. Subsequent hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. There is no chyle flow here. Then develop the medial neck preparation. The superior thyroid artery must be ligated in advance, as there is a strong outflow in the direction of the tumor conglomerate. Finally, palpatory exploration of the wound cavity. There is no evidence of further metastatic nodes. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure with Vicryl 4.0 and Ethilon 5.0. Application of a pressure bandage. In the meantime, a rapid incision was made by telephone, stating that a tonsil carcinoma R0 was resected on the left side as part of the tumor tonsillectomy. A resection is therefore necessary. Final inspection of the tonsil lobe. If the wound bed is dry, the operation is completed without complications. Final consultation with the anesthetist.","Tonsillectomy, Neck dissection

Findings on CT correlated. Now entering with the Kleinsasser tube size B and adjusting the tumor. Tumor is now resected successively with a safety margin of between 0.5 and just under 1 cm. Laterally, the resection extends to the cartilage, anteriorly also dorsally to the arytenoid cartilage, which is resected slightly in the interlaryngeal area. Caudally, the resection extends to the cricoid cartilage. The tumor is removed and resected microscopically with a safety margin. The tumor is suture-marked. Due to the fact that the anterior and posterior margins are somewhat narrower, a glottic, subglottic and supraglottic margin sample is taken from the area of the anterior commissure and the adjacent soft tissue. Also marginal sample dorsally in the area of the arytenoid cartilage and the arytenoid fold transition. In the frozen section, all samples are tumor-free or the edges of the tumor are tumor-free. So R0 situation. Hemostasis follows. In the anterior region, the transverse artery in the area of the conus elasticus had to be bipolized during the resection; this will be repeated. In the dorsal area, the inferior laryngeal artery was treated with clips. No more bleeding here. Most careful hemostasis. No evidence of bleeding on final inspection. Exposure of the cartilage in the area of the anterior commissure and on the left in the entire area. Patient therefore received Sobelin 600 mg i.v. Please continue antibiotics for one week.

The above-mentioned surgery was therefore indicated.,"Introductory consultation with the anesthesiologist. After reclination of the head, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The described tumor is seen, which starts next to the uvula on the left, extends over the palatal arch and the tonsillar lobe to the base of the tongue. The tumor grows in the area of the cranial oropharyngeal side wall ulcerating in depth. Therefore, flap coverage is also indicated according to the CT findings. PEG placement is performed first: insertion of the flexible esophagoscope. Push through into the stomach. After creating the diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube in a typical manner without complications. Fixation of the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Then repositioning of the patient. Skin disinfection, sterile draping of all relevant surgical areas. Start with the neck dissection on the left: Skin incision curved in a typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure and preservation of the common carotid artery, internal/external carotid artery, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Also visualization of the branches of the cervical plexus. Development of the posterior neck preparation and later also the anterior neck preparation. This results in the removal of levels II-V. All branches of the cervical plexus were exposed and preserved. Neck dissection on the right: skin incision as on the opposite side. Exposure of all structures as on the opposite side. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. This results in a level II-IV neck dissection and smaller parts of V. All structures are exposed and preserved as on the opposite side. Tracheostoma creation: Small Kocher's cross-section. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature. Spreading of these. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Undercutting, clamping, severing and ligation using puncture ligatures. Exposure of the trachea. Preparation of a small wide-pedicled Björk flap. Epithelization of the same in a typical manner. Insertion of a laryngectomy tube. Tumor resection from the transoral and trancervical side, initially from the left side of the neck dissection. Dissection of the external carotid artery, internal carotid artery, vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve, accessorius nerve and internal jugular vein as well as the superior ganglion from the pharyngeal wall. Nerve vessels are dissected from the pharyngeal tube up to the base of the skull. No tumor infiltrates visible here. The submandibular gland is also extirpated. The lingual nerve is exposed and preserved. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the same. The digastric muscle is also resected. All important vessels and nerve structures are then looped using Vesselloops and pulled to the side. Transorally, the tumor is incised on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm. This results in the removal of the entire pharyngeal wall including the attached soft tissue up to the level of the piriform sinus entrance. Resection extends inwards to the base of the tongue. Approximately 20% of this is resected. The posterior pharyngeal wall is partially resected. The tumor specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section diagnostics. Similarly, marginal samples are taken from the palatal arch, from the pharyngeal wall medially, from the transition from the posterior palatal arch to the tonsil, from the lateral in the form of the uvula and a soft tissue marginal sample from the cranial-basal side. In the frozen section preparation, taking into account the marginal samples in healthy tissue. Unclear situation at the transition from palatal arch to medial pharyngeal wall. Therefore, another cranial-medial margin sample was taken from the pharyngeal wall at the junction of the tonsillar lobe and palatal arch. No tumor infiltrates in the frozen section here either. Thus a definitive R0 situation. The result is a defect on the palatal arch extending beyond the uvula, posterior pharyngeal wall, lateral pharyngeal wall up to the entrance of the piriform sinus and the base of the tongue and vallecula up to the epiglottis. A radial lobe is measured in terms of length, width and three-dimensional shape. The radial lobe is then elevated from the left forearm: Mark the radialis flap, which reaches 13 cm in length and 8 cm in maximum width. First lift the flap from the ulnar side. Then extend the incision into the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the vascular pedicle, exposure of the superficial vascular system. Then lift the flap from the radial side. Deposition of the flap distally and ligation of the radial artery cranially and caudally using 4.0 Prolene sutures. The flap is then lifted subfascially along its pedicle, including the superficial venous system. Outgoing vessels are bipolized or treated with clips, larger ones are ligated. Cranial view of the connection between the superficial and deep venous system. There is only a rudimentary venous outflow via the radial vein, which is divided into smaller vessels. These are clipped. The interosseous artery is very small and is clipped. The flap is removed at the brachial artery and two larger branches from the cephalic vein. The veins are ligated. The artery is supplied with a 6.0 Vascufil suture. Saturation during the elevation is always 100%, clinically no abnormalities. The flap is flushed with heparin. Subsequent insertion of the flap: insertion into the defect. Successive incorporation of the flap into the defect using 3.0 Vicryl single-button sutures, which is successful without tension. Flap suturing partially with sutures in place. Subsequent arterial anastomosis. The superior thyroid artery is selected. After conditioning the vessels, suture with 8.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. Conditioning of the two outlets of the cephalic vein. One outlet is anastomosed with an outlet from the facial vein. Anastomosis is performed after conditioning the vessels with a 2.5 mm coupler. The other outlet is then anastomosed with an outlet from the V. thyroidea media after conditioning the vessel ends using a 2.5 mm coupler. Again, after opening the vessels, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. This is followed by extensive irrigation of the neck wounds on both sides and careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain on both sides. Pressure dressing on both sides. Covering the forearm defect on the left: For this purpose, a 0.7-0.8 mm thick split-thickness skin graft is obtained from the thigh according to size. This is successively incorporated into the forearm skin defect. Application of a hydrogel-Mepilex dressing. Application of a loose compress dressing, wrapping with absorbent cotton. The arm is fixed in a Kramer splint in a functional position and wrapped with an elastic bandage. The arm was applied before the anastomosis suture. Arm always well perfused, saturation 100%. Finally, removal of the laryngectomy tube. Insertion of an 8 mm tracheostomy tube, which is fixed with sutures. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is intubated and ventilated and transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Final consultation with the anesthesia department. Please continue heparin perfusor 500 I.U./hour as started intraoperatively, also postoperatively for 5 days. Check the blood circulation of the flap clinically and via suture marking on the left side of the neck in a typical manner according to the plan. Please continue antibiotics as started intraoperatively with Unacid 3 g for 2-3 days. Feeding for approx. 10 days via the inserted PEG tube, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up.

CT showed clear herniation into the thyroid cartilage on the left side without complete penetration.","After bronchoscopic intubation of the patient, the anesthesiology colleagues first perform a pharyngo-laryngoscopy to determine the extent of the mass again. This revealed the aforementioned mass in the area of the left piriform sinus, the right piriform sinus anterior and lateral wall extending into the tip of the piriform sinus and infiltrating from here towards the arytenoid and the left hemilarynx. Pronounced edema also in the area of the aryepiglottic fold. The left vocal fold is edematous. This confirms the indication for laryngectomy. Due to the circumscribed extension in the area of the hypoharynx and piriform sinus, most likely with primary closure. Now reposition the patient with xylocaine and adrenaline. Skin incision to lift an apron flap. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap on both sides and lifting of the apron flap. Suturing of the flap. Exposure of the external jugular veins on both sides, these remain intact on both sides. An anterior branch of the external jugular vein is ligated on the left side. Now first perform the neck dissection. Start with the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Resection of the caudal part of the capsule, exposure of the entire length of the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with preservation of the superior thyroid artery and resection of the cervical artery. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve. A metastasis measuring approx. 5 x 3 without peronodal or infiltrative growth and adherent to the sternocleidomastoid muscle can now be seen on the cervical vascular sheath in the area of the jugulo-facial angle. Dissection of the internal jugular vein after previous visualization of the accessorius nerve. Operation on the internal jugular vein, which, like the facial vein, is very weakly developed on this side, is coagulated and removed. Complete dissection of the vein. Release of the accessorius triangle, lateral exposure of the internal jugular vein with careful protection of the common carotid artery and vagus nerve. Include the cervical artery here. Now carefully evacuate levels Va and Vb while carefully preserving the plexus branches without evidence of lymphatic leakage. Careful inspection. Removal of the neck resectate en bloc and, if dry and completely evacuated, insertion of a moist abdominal drape and turning to the opposite side. The procedure is basically exactly the same here. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland with resection of the caudal part of the capsule. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Dissection of the anterior neck preparation with preservation of the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve and with removal of the cervical artery. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, here a suspicious lymph node change measuring approx. 2 cm can be seen in the area of the jugulofacial angle, this is coarse on palpation, therefore clinically V.a. cN2c neck status. Visualization of the accessorius nerve. Complete exposure of the internal jugular vein. The facial vein is exposed and remains intact. Now clearing of the accessorius triangle and subsequent removal of level Va and level Vb. Finally, also dry conditions. No evidence of lymph leakage. Now turn to the laryngeal surgery. Exposure of the hyoid, detachment in front of the infrahyoid muscles, skeletonization of the larynx, exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus and exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea on both sides. On the left side, detachment of the infrahyoid musculature, but here leaving a layer on the laryngeal skeleton in the case of thyroid cartilage infiltration. Now incision of the subperichondrium on the right side, detachment of the perichondrium on the inner surface while carefully preserving the pharyngeal mucosa. Now enter with the Mc Ivor spatula. Expose the vallecula. Performing the pharyngotomy in the area of the right vallecula. Widening of the pharyngotomy. Snaring of the epiglottis. Incision along the aryepiglottic fold towards the postcricoid region. Now complete overview of the tumor. Tumor extension as described above with deep ulcerated tumor in the area of the left piriform sinus well defined. Regular mucosal conditions in the marginal area. Somewhat granular mucosal conditions in the area of the postcricoid region, therefore choose a larger safety distance and demonstration to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who recommends a sparing resection in the area of the postcricoid region, otherwise coordination of the procedure. Further resection of the tumor on all sides with at least a 1.5 cm safety margin on all sides. Lateral to the tumor, removal of a soft tissue mantle, palpatorily no deep growth towards the soft tissues of the neck. In the meantime, tracheotomy has already been performed. Initially a visual tracheotomy. Re-intubation onto an LE tube. Now resection caudal removal of the tumor approx. 2-3 cm above the esophageal inlet. Removal of the trachea after previous snaring and removal of the resectate. The specimen now shows macroscopic removal in toto on all sides. ............. Hypopharyngeal carcinoma but now cover the tumor. Take contiguous mucosal samples over the entire resection area. These are thread-marked and later assessed in rapid diagnostics as completely free of tumor and dysplasia. A caudally tapering strip of mucosa is now visible, but with at least 4-5 cm of residual mucosa caudally to cranially. It was therefore decided to perform a primary reconstruction with the local mucosa. After palpation, perform a myotomy in the area of the upper oesophageal sphincter and insert an 8 mm provost prosthesis using the usual pull-through method with puncture about 1 cm caudal to the future tracheostoma edge and insertion of a nasogastric tube and meticulous mucosal suture with 3.0 Vicryl while inverting the .................... Caudal pharyngeal suture area and base of tongue on both sides, thin pharyngeal mucosa circumscribed on the right side, this is later reinforced with pharyngeal musculature with an overall well-preserved and strong tube. Now in the pharyngeal muscles and inversion of the submucosal pharyngeal suture. Finally, caudal suturing of the pharyngeal tube with the thyroid flap and final suturing of the infrahyoid muscles to the base of the tongue and over the pharyngeal sutures. The tracheostoma was sutured in place beforehand, with a second skin incision and circular suturing of the trachea. Finally, stable tracheostoma. Final wound inspection. Circumscribed meticulous hemostasis with generally dry wound conditions. Irrigation with Ringer's solution and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 mm Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Finally, reintubation to a 10-gauge tracheoflex cannula and completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics and Unacid 1.5 g; please continue this antibiotic treatment for 3 days postoperatively. The X-ray emesis was performed on the 8th postoperative day. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT4a cN2c G3 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the left. After receiving the definitive histology, presentation at our interdisciplinary tumor conference to plan adjuvant therapy.","Partial pharyngectomy with laryngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Provox Prosthesis, Endoscopy

No infiltration of the bone could be identified on CT, albeit with limited assessability. Therefore transoral resection planned and neck dissection.","Insertion of the oral spatula according to McIvor. Exposure of the tumor. The position of the tumor is shown, which grows from the soft palate in the cranial area and upper tonsil area towards the alveolar ridge and hard palate. First, the tumor is cut around the mucosal area with a safety margin of at least 1 cm in all areas. Resection includes the entire tonsil, anterior palatal arch, mucosa of the alveolar ridge and lower anterior parts of the buccal mucosa. The posterior molar is located at the tumor margins. It is therefore removed. The tumor extends to the alveolar ridge. Push off the bone here. Further removal of the tumor also basally. This is successful in the area of the tonsil or pharyngeal wall. In the area of the pterygoid muscles and the ascending mandibular branch, the tumor grows in depth. This reaches the ascending mandibular branch and clearly erodes it. Further displacement of the tumor from the bone. The inferior alveolar nerve is also infiltrated in the tumor and is removed. Tumor preparation is removed. Suture marking: Suture blue short-short anterior, alveolar ridge lateral short-long, anterior alveolar ridge medial long-long, marginal specimen ( tonsil medial ). Green suture: short-short medial ( hard palate ) short-long cranial at hard palate/cheek junction, long-long soft palate basal retrotonsillar. Suture purple: long-long basal at the level of the soft tissue on the hard palate, short-long soft tissue basal lower tonsil pole. In addition, marginal sample of soft tissue at the lateral alveolar ridge, marginal sample from the buccal fat plug and marginal sample from the buccal mucosa extending from the hard palate to the lateral aleolar ridge. Overall: Bone infiltration with significant bone erosion both in the area of the ascending mandibular branch and in the area of the alveolus in the last molar. Due to the situation, <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the maxillofacial surgery department was consulted. Findings confirmed by colleague. Joint decision to transfer patient to maxillofacial surgery, as removal of the mandible and surrounding soft tissue is required for rehabilitation. Primary RCT does not appear to make sense in the case of significant bone infiltration. Subsequent PEG placement. Insertion of the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach. No abnormalities were found on gross examination. After diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm stomach wall tube without complications. This is fixed to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient should be referred to the maxillofacial surgery department after consultation with colleagues to plan further surgical treatment.","Transoral tumor tonsillectomy, PEG placement

This already reveals a massively loose tooth and a bridge on the right lower jaw. Consultation with the anesthetist, who confirms that the prosthesis was already massively loose before the procedure. Suturing of the tongue and now presentation and exposure of the tumor. The tumor is then cut around with the electric nasel with a safety margin of between 0.5 and 0.8 mm. A clear crater appears in the center of the tumor towards the depth. Particularly deep resection in this area. A marginal sample is then taken from this area for a frozen section after the tumor has otherwise been safely removed macroscopically in healthy tissue. The frozen section is found to be tumor-free intraoperatively. Several larger vessels are exposed during dissection and ligated after transection. The resection now extends over the entire edge of the tongue on the left side. The tip of the tongue remains untouched. The base of the tongue also remains untouched. Repeated subtle hemostasis. Then removal of all instruments and repositioning of the patient for hypopharyngeal carcinoma resection. First insertion of the small irrigation tube. The tumor cannot be sufficiently exposed with this. This is followed by laborious insertion of the torso retractor. This allows the tumor to be exposed very well. The tumor extends over the entire lateral wall of the hypopharynx and moves over the lateral wall here into the lateral wall of the piriform sinus. It also slightly touches the anterior wall of the piriform sinus. In the upper part and the plica pharyngoepiglottica. Now cut around the tumor with the CO2 laser with a sufficient safety margin of about 0.5 cm. The tumor is resected down to the pharyngeal musculature and then remains strictly in this plane up to the entrance of the piriform sinus. Partial resection of the plica phayngoepiglottica. The arytenoid cartilage remains completely intact. The tumor is then also incised in the caudal area and then removed. Subtle hemostasis. Representative marginal samples are then taken from the entire area of deposition and the wound bed. One of these marginal samples, called the anterior piriform sinus, is then found to have a carcinoma in situ in the frozen section, so that a further resection and another marginal sample is taken. This marginal sample is then found to be tumor-free intraoperatively, which means that the tumor R0 appears to be resected. Further subtle hemostasis. The resection now reaches into the middle of the piriform sinus. If the wound is dry, remove all instruments. Insertion of a naso-gastric feeding tube. Then reposition for neck dissection on the left side. First injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then skin incision and layer-by-layer dissection in depth. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. From there, long dissection of the cervical vascular sheath from caudal to cranial. Dissection of the landmarks with the omohyoid muscle in the caudal region and the digaster muscle, venter posterior in the cranial region. Also expose the capsule of the submandibular gland. Then expose the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessory triangle and preparation of the caudal neck preparation with long-distance preparation of the vagus nerve and the plexus branches of the cervical plexus. Subsequent dissection of the ventral neck preparation, also sparing all branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery, and removal of the hypoglossal triangle, sparing the cervical sinus and hypoglossal nerve. Here, too, all branches of the external carotid artery are spared. Finally, subtle hemostasis. The result is a neck dissection level Ib to V. In the course of the dissection, several enlarged lymph nodes were found, some of which appeared suspicious. If the wound was dry, a Redon drain was inserted followed by two-layer wound closure and dressing. Repeated endaural bleeding control. If the wound is dry, the procedure is ended after a final consultation with the anesthesia colleagues, which was also held at the start of the operation. Further procedure depending on the final histopathological findings as decided by the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Partial glossectomy, Left neck dissection

Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: After positioning the patient, inspection of the primary tumor region. A circumscribed exophytic tumor is seen in the area of the left tonsil. This is mainly localized in the caudal part of the tonsil, just exceeds the tonsil border caudally, but otherwise remains limited to the tonsil lobe. After exposure of the tonsillar lobe, insertion of the retractors and positioning of the robotic arms. A robot-assisted tumor resection in the form of a tumor tonsillectomy is now performed. Deep removal of the surrounding musculature. Subtotal removal of the anterior palatal arch. Resection up to the base of the tongue. Macroscopic in sano resection. The specimen is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. This shows an R0 situation with a somewhat unclear situation in the area of the caudal margin.

Bleeding from an artery in level IIb, presumably the lingual artery. Ligation of the same. Blustilla. Further ligation of another vessel. Hemostasis. Protection of the accessorius nerve during level IIb evacuation. Exposure and sparing of the hypoglossal nerve and the facial artery/vein, the carotid artery and the vagus nerve. The bifurcation contains enlarged LK, which do not appear clinically suspicious. Protection of the plexus branches. Removal of the anterior neck preparation. Finally, hemostasis with the bipolar. Insertion of a Redon drainage, two-layer wound closure. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Transfer to ND right: On the right side there is a previous operation in the sense of a carotid operation, therefore the incision is essentially made in the old scar. Only in the very cranial area is the incision moved slightly dorsally, as the scar area extends very far into the parotid gland. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is somewhat more difficult due to scarring from the previous operation. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. Finding the cervical vascular sheath. This is slightly altered by the previous operation and has moved further medially. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Locating the accessorius nerve and clearing Level IIb, aIII and IV while sparing the plexus branches. Insertion of a 10 Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure.","Tonsillectomy, Neck dissection

Dissection of the piriform sinus on this side. The superior thyroid artery is exposed and preserved. Subsequent dissection on the opposite side in the direction of the tumor. It becomes apparent that the tumor has most likely infiltrated the soft tissue next to the pharyngeal wall. Therefore, the upper pole of the thyroid gland is undercut and resected. In the area of the thyroid resection region, a suture is placed under and over the wall. The larynx is resected as a whole up to the thyroid gland, including the pharyngeal wall and upper thyroid pole. All soft tissue in the hyoid bone area is also resected pre-epiglottis. Now enter the left paramedian larynx. A tumor is revealed. This is resected successively with a safety margin of at least 1 to 1 ˝ cm in all directions. The entire pharyngeal wall on the right including the posterior wall is removed. A remnant of the posterior wall and the entire lateral piriform sinus wall remain. The entire postcricoid region must be resected in the direction of the esophageal opening, resulting in unfavorable and very narrow conditions. Before this, the thyroid isthmus, which is very thin, is cut through and the trachea is exposed and the trachea is opened in the 1st/2nd intercartilaginous space and sutured to the skin of the neck. The larynx with the entire pharyngeal wall on the right including the upper pole of the thyroid gland and the entire postcricoid region up to the esophageal entrance is then removed. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section examination. Carcinoma in situ on the left side in the frozen section. A 2-3 mm thick strip from the left resection margin is therefore cut again. Subsequently, another marginal sample approx. 2 mm wide is taken, which is also marked with a suture. The frozen section still shows mild to moderate dysplasia, no indication for further resection. Thus an overall R0 situation. What remains is a strip that is too narrow, barely 2-3 cm wide, particularly in the direction of the esophageal opening. Primary suturing does not seem sensible in terms of preserving the swallowing function. The decision was therefore made to cover the defect with a flap. Due to the patient's poor vascular situation, his secondary diseases and the favorable soft tissue conditions in the thoracic region, which allow a very thin flap to be elevated, the defect is covered using a pectoralis major flap from the right. First, the entire wound area was irrigated with H202 and Ringer's solution and the bleeding was carefully stopped. Then measure the size of the defect. Flap size is 10 x 8 cm. Corresponding trapezoidal shape in the direction of the esophageal opening. This is followed by elevation of the pectoralis major flap, provox creation and defect coverage in the pharyngeal region: after measuring the length of the pedicle, the defect is marked on the thoracic wall. Subfascial elevation of a bridge of the deltopectoral flap is then performed. Dissection under the pectoralis muscle and exposure of the vascular pedicle. Subsequently, successive incision of the skin island and development of the myocutaneous pectoralis major flap along the flap pedicle, taking into account the course of the vessel. Dissection up to the clavicle. Subsequent careful hemostasis in the thoracic region. Pull the pedicle through under the further deltopectoral skin bridge. Insertion of the skin island into the defect area. First myotomy and placement of the Provox prosthesis. For this purpose, the muscles on the left side in the area of the constrictor pharyngis muscle are successively cut with the scalpel and the scissors up to the mucosa. This allows better passage of the finger into the esophageal opening. Subsequent insertion of an 8.0 Provox prosthesis in a typical manner without complications. Insertion takes place 1-1.5 cm below the upper tracheal border. Then successive suturing of the pectoralis major flap into the defect, taking particular care to ensure that the passage into the upper esophagus is not too narrow. Tension-free suturing of the flap. Left lateral and cranial 2nd muscle suture over the flap. Muscle pedicle comes to lie over the suture on the right side. Careful hemostasis again. Irrigation with Ringer's solution. Skin closure in the neck area by placing the apron flap back with insertion of a Redon drainage in each side of the neck and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Insertion of a 9 mm tracheal cannula. Now wound closure in the thorax area. It turns out that the skin can no longer be mobilized in such a way that primary closure is possible. Therefore covering in the thigh area. Split skin 0.5 mm thick is removed with the dermatome. Primary closure in the thoracic region as far as possible. A residual defect remains, which is covered with split skin. A total of 2 Redon drains are inserted in the axillary area and next to the flap pedicle. Mepilex with Chitogel is applied to the thoracic wound and thigh wound as a wound dressing. The procedure was completed without complications. Overall cT3-4 hypopharyngeal carcinoma with infiltration of the postcricoid area and larynx. At least cN2b status. Patient goes to intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics for a total of one week with Unacid 1.5 g 3 x/die. Feeding via inserted PEG for 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Inserted feeding tube should remain in place for splinting.","TU resection, Neck dissection

This included laryngoscopic placement of the glottic plane and inspection of the trachea, subglottis and main bronchi, which revealed normal mucosal conditions. The surgeon then intubates the patient without any problems. Flexible esophagogastroscopy. The flexible instrument is inserted into the oesophagus without any problems and the patient is visualized as far as the stomach, where a regular folded relief can be seen. Aspiration of the insufflated air. Then mirror back and carefully inspect the esophageal mucosa, which is also non-irritating and inconspicuous. Now reposition the patient and inspect the oral cavity, oropharynx, pharynx and larynx with the size C Kleinsasser tube. Here, too, the mucous membrane is free of irritation and inconspicuous with no evidence of a tumor. Insertion of the TE blocker. Inspection of the tonsil regions on both sides. Palpation of the left tonsil, which is slightly indurated. Start with tonsillectomy of the left side. Mucosal incision close to the uvula and subsequent sharp dissection of the anterior and posterior palatal arch. Then detachment of the tonsil from the upper pole after exposing and severing and coagulation of the pole vessels. Further dissection of the tonsil with the raspatory. Repeated coagulation of smaller vessel inflows. Finally, dissection up to the lower tonsil pole and removal of the tonsil. Subsequent coagulation of the lower pole vessels with a portion of the tongue base tonsil. Then perform a palatal arch plasty and move to the right side. Identical procedure here. The palatal arch plasty was also performed at the end of the operation. The right side was also removed with a portion of the tongue base tonsil. Careful inspection of the tonsils. These are largely unremarkable and are sent separately for histopathological examination. Then insertion of the velo tractio and indirect inspection of the epipharynx. Adenoid tissue is also seen here, no evidence of a tumor. Then curettage of the nasopharynx and this preparation is also sent separately for histopathological examination. Then careful hemostasis is performed. Adjustment of the base of the tongue with the small water tube. This is also visible and palpable. Take biopsies from both sides and the middle. These are also sent for histopathological examination. Then careful hemostasis here too. All instruments are removed and the patient is repositioned for neck dissection on the left side. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline. Now start with an incision along the sternocleidomastoid. Dissection in layers in depth. Cut through the platysma. Ligation of the external jugular vein. Further exposure and dissection in depth. Here, search for the cervical vascular sheath. This is then dissected over a long distance. Exposure of the vagus nerve, which is displaced medially and re-embedded here in the sense of a neurolysis. Severe scarring in the area of the venous angle and a lymph node conglomerate can be seen. Extremely careful dissection here. The conglomerate is also firmly attached to the hypoglossal triangle. Here the hypoglossal nerve is located via the cervical profunda. Long-distance dissection of the nerve of both the cervical profunda and the hypoglossal nerve. The hypoglossal nerve is dissected free from its bed and displaced cranially. Lateral to the cervical vascular sheath, the accessorius nerve is then accessed. Long-distance nerve preparation here too. Perform neurolysis and re-embedding of the nerve. Finally, removal of the entire hypoglossal triangle and the lateral neck preparation. Dissection of the neck preparation ventral to the cervical vascular sheath. All venous and arterial vessels are preserved here. At the end of the dissection, a neck dissection of level Ib, II, III, IV results. At the end, careful hemostasis and irrigation of the wound. Insertion of a Redon drainage and two-layer wound closure. Then application of a pressure bandage and completion of the procedure. Final consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Further procedure depending on the findings of the histological tissue examinations.","Tonsillectomy, CUP panendoscopy, PE (Proximal esophagus)

The histological work-up revealed a diagnosis of G2-3 squamous cell carcinoma in each case. Hence the indication for the above-mentioned procedure.,"After induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues, the surgeon first performs a tracheoscopy. The trachea is freely visible up to the bifurcation. Subsequent intubation by the surgeon without any problems. Entry with the esophagoscope under constant air insufflation into the stomach. Inversion. Inspection of the gastric mucosa. Inconspicuous conditions here. On retraction of the esophagoscope, inspection of the esophageal mucosa. Here, in the area of the cardioesophageal junction, there are clearly irritated conditions in the sense of a chronic reflux problem. This should be clarified internally in the course of the procedure. Now enter with the Kleinsasser tube and inspect the piriform sinuses on both sides, the vallecula, the base of the tongue, the epiglottis and the endolarynx. Inconspicuous conditions here. Inspection of the postcricoid region. Here also unremarkable conditions. Now adjusting with the Mc Ivor spatula. Inspection of the oral cavity. The rough mass can already be felt in the area of the left tonsil. Now dissect the tumor far into the healthy tissue. Start in the area of the anterior palatal arch. Dissection with the electric needle. Finally, the tumor is developed from cranial to caudal. The glossotonsillar groove falls. The mucosa in the area of the alveolar ridge is removed, the bone is not exposed. Ultimately, the tumor is detached from the pharyngeal musculature. An arterial pharyngeal branch and a presumed outlet of the lingual artery are lanced. Finally, the tumor is removed far into the healthy tissue. The removed tumor is thread-marked with short short caudal, short long medial, long long cranial and green thread short short basal. The specimen is sent for final histology. Bipolar hemostasis. The posterior palatal arch could be preserved as far as possible. Relaxing the Mc Ivor spatula, 5 minutes. Re-inspection. No more evidence of further bleeding. The procedure was completed without complications. Conclusion: Overall left tumor tonsillectomy. No evidence of a second malignancy on panendoscopy.

After induction of anesthesia, 3 g of Unacid is administered i.v. The oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx are then inspected again. The tumor is as described above and in comparison with the CT scan, the tumor is limited to the left hypopharynx. The tip of the piriform sinus, the entrance to the esophagus and the entire piriform sinus on the right are tumor-free. The larynx appears infiltrated like a tumor, the thyroid cartilage is perforated. On the left, the tumor attaches to the hyoid bone. After repositioning and alcohol disinfection with infiltration anesthesia, the skin incision is made on the right side along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Clearing out the lateral neck preparation after exposing the cervical vascular sheath and the accessorius nerve as well as the deep cervical plexus branches. From cranial to caudal to below the omohyoid muscle and then dissection medially along the digastric muscle onto the capsule of the submandibular gland. Clear the medial neck preparation, also exposing the hypoglossal nerve and protecting it. Locating the superior laryngeal nerve with its accompanying vessels. Ligation of the same. Now identical procedure on the left side. Here, tumor lymph nodes are seen extending to the mastoid and in the supraclavicular fossa far to the lateral and nuchal side, also skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Exposure of the accessor nerve, which is surrounded by tumor masses but can be bluntly released from them. Dissection of the cervical vascular sheath in its course. Exposure of the vagus nerve and the deep cervical plexus branches. Locate the thoracic duct and dissect it laterally. It becomes apparent that the tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes extend far to the side and infiltrate the accessorius at the posterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. It was therefore decided to remove the accessorius and sternocleidomastoid cranially and to explore the neck block laterally in one piece. Also remove and cut the cervical plexus branches. Dissect down to the first rib caudally and laterally to near the acromioclavicular joint. Dissect nuchally to below the trapezius muscle, clearing out the complete regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Dissect cranially to the prelaryngeal muscles and to the capsule of the submandibular gland; the hypoglossal nerve can also be exposed and preserved here. Subsequently raise the apron flap and turn towards the larynx. Dissect the infrahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone and knock them down. This shows that, as already suspected, the left paramedian thyroid cartilage has been perforated and the tumor is infiltrating the prelaryngeal musculature. The detached musculature is readapted using Vicryl sutures. The right prelaryngeal musculature is then separated and knocked down. The right piriform sinus is then detached from the thyroid cartilage skeleton. Subsequent right paramedian approach to the epiglottis and opening of the pharynx. Preservation of the linugal epiglottis mucosa and preparation of the aryepiglottic fold to the ary on the right side. Separation of the piriform sinus from the cricoid cartilage, resection of the tumor now under visual control, including parts of the base of the tongue and the lateral pharyngeal wall on the left up to parts of the piriform sinus. The posterior pharyngeal wall remains completely intact, as does the tip of the left piriform sinus. Now carefully stop the bleeding. Removal of the laryngeal preparation, taking the former tracheostoma with it, previously creating a new tracheostoma with placement of the lower tracheostoma sutures. Now removal of the hyoid bone, which appears to have been attached to the tumor on the left. Therefore, removal of the hyoid bone with part of the surrounding musculature while sparing the hypoglossal nerve for final histology as a resection. Representative marginal samples are then taken, which are found to be tumor-free by pathology, so that a safe R0 resection can be assumed. In the further course, consultation of <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the phoniatrics department. Application of a size 8 provox prosthesis in the typical manner. Finally, careful hemostasis. H202 irrigation Insertion of 2 Redon drains. Inverting pharyngeal suture. Subsequent two-layer wound closure in the midline. Finally, renewed irrigation, check for wound dryness and two-layer skin suture and readaptation of the remaining tracheostoma. Intraoperatively, 2 x 3 g of Unacid were administered, antibiotics should be continued for 5 days, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit awake.","Laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Re-tracheotomy, Endoscopy

Sterile wiping and covering of the patient and injection of supra in the area of the U-shaped incision. Start of the operation by tracheotomy. To do this, make an incision below the cricoid. Cut through the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infralaryngeal musculature and division of the musculature in the midline. Identification of the cricoid cartilage and sharp dissection of the cricoid cartilage. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus and coagulation of the same. After transection of the thyroid isthmus, identification of the anterior tracheal wall and sharp entry into the 2nd to 3rd intertracheal annular gap and creation of a tracheostoma in the usual manner using epithelializing single-button sutures. Insertion of an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube. Subsequent transition to transoral tumor resection. Once the tumor has been positioned, the tumor, which occupies the right tonsil lobe, is resected caudally starting parauvularly macroscopically in healthy musculature using the ultrasonic knife. Laterally, the resection margin extends to the soft tissue of the neck. Caudally, the glossotonsillar groove as well as adjacent parts of the base of the tongue must be included in the resected area. The entire resectate is then sent for a frozen section histological examination for orientation. This reveals narrow resection margins in the area of the tumor base as well as in the area of the base of the tongue. Therefore, a transoral resection from the base of the tumor is performed as far as possible, as well as an extensive resection in the area of the medial base of the tongue. These prove to be free of tumor on frozen section histology. Subsequent transition to neck dissection, initially on the right side. After making the apron flap incision, a radical neck dissection is performed here, as the large metastasis has already infiltrated the internal jugular vein together with the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the accessorius nerve. The vascular nerve sheath is therefore located caudally, the jugular vein is exposed and then cut off and severed. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is also cut caudally. The entire preparation is thus successively developed cranially with resection of parts of the cervical plexus. The hypoglossal nerve as well as the common carotid artery and external carotid artery can be dissected from the metastasis in a healthy layer. The cranial resection also includes the caudal part of the parotid gland. Finally, the internal jugular vein is exposed just below the jugular foramen, dissected free and also removed there. Creation of a Redon suction drainage. Transition to neck dissection on the opposite side. There is no evidence of a suspicious lymph node metastasis. Selective neck dissection is performed in regions II to V, sparing all non-lymphatic structures. Then skeletonize the lingual artery, which will later be used for anastomosis. On the right side, create the passage into the hypopharynx from the lateral side. With a good view of the caudal resection margin, tissue from the adjacent tongue base and the vallecula to the lingual epiglottis is resected again and examined using frozen section histology. This was also found to be R0. In addition, the external carotid artery is freed of all remaining fatty and connective tissue in the oropharyngeal direction in the sense of a further resection from the tumor base; this tissue is also ultimately found to be tumor-free on frozen section histology, so that an overall R0 resection can be assumed. Subsequent removal of a radial lobe graft of the appropriate size by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (6 x 10 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Covering of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Subsequent removal of region I with resection of the submandibular gland on the right side after exposing and sparing the ramus marginalis mandibulae. The radial flap is then inserted into the oropharyngeal defect and sutured into the defect starting transorally. The final sutures are placed transcervically from the caudal side. The vascular pedicle is then guided to the opposite side. Here the lingual artery is anastomosed end-to-end with the radial artery. The venous anastomoses are made through 2 veins of the radial flap in an end-to-side manner to the internal jugular vein. Finally, a Redon suction drain and a flap are placed in the left side of the neck in the usual manner. Folding back of the apron flap, completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis of the tracheostoma and two-layer wound closure in the usual manner. Suturing of the tracheostomy tube after reintubation of the patient and completion of the procedure and transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Placement of the PEG tube: Flexible pre-scanning with the gastroesophagoscope into the stomach. Identification of the anterior wall of the stomach and performance of a positive diaphanoscopy. Insertion of the PEG tube in the usual manner using the thread pull-through method without complications. Careful reflection and termination of the PEG insertion without complications. Conclusion: Combined transoral-transcervical tumor resection of an oropharyngeal carcinoma with extension into the glossotonsillar groove on the right side. Radical neck dissection on the right and selective neck dissection on the left, reconstruction of the oropharyngeal defect on the right with a microvascularly anastomosed radial flap graft from the left forearm, creation of a plastic tracheostoma and a PEG tube, anastomosis of the microvascular radial flap graft on the opposite side to the lingual artery and in an end-to-side manner to the internal jugular vein.","Right tumor tonsillectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Pedicled flap (Pectoralis major)

However, induction chemotherapy did not lead to tumor reduction but to tumor progression, so that a laryngectomy ultimately had to be performed.","Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthetist. Then entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the hypopharynx and larynx. No abnormalities in the hypopharynx including the piriform sinus on both sides. Inspection of the laryngeal plane. Here, an exophytic tumor is seen in the area of the vocal folds with a transition to the pocket folds on both sides. The vocal folds themselves are no longer visible. The arytenoids are glassy swollen on both sides and on the right side the tumor extends to the ary. A definite infiltration on the right side of the arytenoid cartilage cannot be confirmed. A nasogastric tube is then inserted. Insertion with the flexible esophagoscope and pre-scanning into the stomach. If the diaphanoscopy is good, a PEG tube is inserted using the thread pull-through method. The skin incision is then made in the form of an apron flap. As the patient has already undergone a tracheostomy due to shortness of breath, the stoma is also incised so that part of the trachea can also be removed. A subglottic extension of the tumor was described. Then dissection of the apron flap in the usual manner below the platysma. Then fixation and suturing of the wound edges. Then skeletonization of the hyoid bone with detachment of the musculature and the base of the tongue. Then skeletonization of the larynx and detachment of the oblique laryngeal musculature. However, this prelaryngeal musculature is left on the larynx. A CT scan cannot rule out the possibility of a thyroid cartilage rupture 100%. At the very least, the thyroid cartilage is eroded and, for oncological safety reasons, a relatively large amount of tissue must be left on the outside of the larynx. Then skeletonize the thyroid cartilage upper horns on both sides, incise the periosteum and push off the piriform sinus on both sides, then perform the pharyngotomy above the hyoid bone. Pull out the epiglottis and incise the pharyngeal mucosa on both sides along the edges of the epiglottis up to the postcricoid region; a relatively large amount of the pharyngeal mucosa must be removed on the right side as the tumor borders are close to the palpation. A lot of mucosa can be saved on the left side. Dissection of the thyroid gland and visualization of the trachea. Deposition of the larynx in the upper tracheal area so that the former upper edge of the stoma is integrated into the specimen. Then take marginal samples in the pharyngeal mucosa area and send for frozen section. No tumor remnants and no carcinoma in situ in the frozen section. The laryngeal specimen itself is macroscopically far removed from the healthy tissue and is sent for final histology. Neck dissection is then performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then expose the cervical vascular sheath, dissect the internal jugular vein, locate and expose the accessorius nerve, expose the submandibular gland and the hypopglossus, clear out levels IIa, III, IV and V while sparing the plexus branches. Then neck dissection on the opposite side (left through <CLINICIAN_NAME>): Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle here too. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, dissection of the internal jugular vein, exposure of the submandibular gland, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve, then clearing of levels IIa to IV while sparing the plexus branches. Then perform the pharyngeal suture in the usual manner with single button sutures for the 1st and 2nd suture, then partial readaptation of the constrictor pharyngis muscle as far as possible. Perform a myotomy on the sternocleidomastoid muscle to achieve a flat stoma. Incision of the stoma, placement of 2 Redon drains. A provox was of course placed before the pharyngeal suture. This involves palpation of the esophageal entrance, which is very wide, so there is no need for a myotomy in the esophagus; you can almost pass through it with 2 QF. The Provox is performed in the usual way using the pull-through method. A size 8 Provox is inserted. The operation is completed without complications. Please continue antibiotics for 3 days. The patient should be fed via the PEG tube for 10 days and then receive another swallow of gruel. If there is no fistula, gradually build up the diet. After receiving the histology, presentation at the tumor conference.","Laryngectomy, Neck dissection, and PEG placement

Then opening of the right side of the neck. Irrigation. Diffuse bleeding can be seen in the area of the dissected skin flap under the platysma, then in all muscular areas. Inspection of the anastomosis under the microscope. Dry conditions in both the arterial and venous areas. The blood supply to the flap is good. Careful hemostasis in the area of the musculature and insertion of a new Redon drainage. A breakthrough to the left side was made intraoperatively in the 1st operation, from which blood is also continuously drained, therefore the left side must also be opened again and here too the same picture of diffuse bleeding. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation and hydrogen. Then insertion of a Redon drainage and two-layer wound closure on both sides. The coagulation diagnostics are unremarkable, but it is striking that the previously over 300,000 thrombocysts have decreased to 17,000,000, possibly due to heparin. The patient received 0.4 m Clexane preoperatively and the graft was flushed with heparin in the usual manner. The patient did not receive systemic intravenous heparin.

Entering the stomach. The gastric mucosa up to the pylorus and with inversion including the cardia is non-irritating and inconspicuous. Careful retraction of the flexible esophagogastroscope under constant air insufflation, here too the mucosa is free of irritation on all sides throughout the esophagus. Insertion of a dental guard for the upper teeth and insertion with the Kleinsasser B-tube. The patient's jaw is slightly clamped, making it difficult to adjust overall. Otherwise, the mucosa in the oral cavity and oropharynx is free of irritation, the posterior pharyngeal wall, the base of the tongue, the tonsilloliths, the epiglottis, the vallecula and the lateral walls of the oropharynx with the glossotonsillar grooves are unremarkable on both sides. Even with further advancement of the small siphon tube, the mucosal conditions in the entire hypopharynx are inconspicuous, the piriform sinuses and the esophageal entrance can be freely unfolded and the postcricoid area is also inconspicuous, as are the interary area and the arytenoid cartilage. The glottis itself is difficult to adjust due to the jaw clamp and the teeth. As there are no further symptoms of discomfort or suspicion of a suspicious mass, no further measures are taken to avoid loosening the dentition. Now insertion of a McIvor mouth blocker and insertion of the velotractio on both sides. Inspection of the nasopharynx with a small mirror; the mucosal conditions are inconspicuous, the posterior edge of the vomer and the choanae and tubular bulges are visible. Removal of the mouth guard and velotractio and re-inspection and palpation of the oral cavity. A leukoplakia measuring approximately 1 ˝ cm x 7 mm can be seen in the area of the right posterior border of the tongue, which can be palpated with clear induration. The mass is excised with a scalpel and scissors and sent for histology with a suture marker. Finally, the bleeding is stopped. There is quite a lot of bleeding here, possibly from an arterial vessel. This is punctured several times, the lingual nerve is not visible macroscopically. Final hemostasis with the bipolar and, due to the gaping wound and the fairly heavy bleeding, the decision to suture the defect primarily using several back-stitch sutures.

In a cN0 situation, our interdisciplinary tumor conference decided on primary surgical treatment with defect reconstruction.","After induction of anesthesia with intubation and preparation of the patient by the anesthesia colleagues, the patient is first positioned. A pharyngoscopy is performed to determine the current extent of the tumor. An exulcerated tumor with infiltration of the lateral and posterior floor of the mouth with transition via the posterior floor of the mouth to the anterior palatal arch and circumscribed to the tonsillar lobe is found on the right edge of the tongue. The tumor grows submucosally from anterior to posterior in the area of the tongue margin, increasingly infiltrating and reaching approx. 1/3 of the extent in the area of the tongue base, in the area of the tongue base completely submucosal tumor growth. The vallecula, epiglottis and pharyngeal side walls are tumor-free. Therefore, first turn to transoral tumor resection. The tumor is cut around with the monopolar and later with the dissection technique, maintaining a safety margin of just under 1 cm in the mucosal area and 1.5 cm in the tongue area. In the area of the tongue muscles, widening of the safety margin. Resection of the soft palate section with removal of the tonsil lobe in the sense of a radical tonsillectomy. Retention of the posterior palatal arch and the uvula. Resection of the entire posterior floor of the mouth. The alveolar ridge is reached here, but no infiltration, therefore incision of the mucosa and detachment with the freer. After mobilization in the tongue area and removal at the mucosal level, it is now apparent that the tumour is clearly growing submandibularly and towards the base of the tongue. No complete transoral control here. Therefore, after complete release in the mucosal area except for the base of the tongue, turn to the transcervical approach to complete the tumor resection. Now reposition the patient. Skin incision on the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Level II shows a coarse, extensive and infiltrative growing metastasis, which was seen with clear infiltration of the muscle when the sternocleidomastoid muscle was dissected. The sternocleidomastoid muscle was therefore removed caudally at the level of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure and free dissection of the internal jugular vein, after cranial dissection removal of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Free dissection of the internal jugular vein up to above the exit of the superior thyroid vein. This shows clear infiltration by the metastasis. There is also infiltration of the accessorius nerve. Deposition of the internal jugular vein above the aforementioned thyroid vein. Separation of the accessorius nerve and removal of the accessorius triangle. Exposure and dissection of the common carotid artery with bulb. Here the metastasis pulls hard on it, infiltrates the hypoglossal nerve, which must be removed, as well as direct contact with the ascending pharyngeal artery and occipital artery, both of which are also removed after ligation; later the lingual artery and facial artery are also ligated and removed. Resection of the metastasis as well as in toto, after removal in the case of circumscribed infiltration, of the digastric muscle. Free dissection of the carotid branches. The anterior neck preparation was removed while preserving the superior thyroid artery. Extirpation of the submandibular gland and thus also basal removal of the floor of the mouth. Evacuation of level I b with careful preservation and exposure of the ramus marginalis mandibulae. Several nodules here. Extension of the pharyngotomy dorsally. Completion and visualization of the resection area via both access routes. Checking the entrance in the area of the pharyngotomy. This is at a clear safety distance from the tumor. Good overview now. Resection and removal on the side wall of the pharynx and resection of the tumor with removal of a good 1/3 of the base of the tongue with macroscopic resection as far as in sano. Previously, completely covering marginal samples were taken in the area of the enoral margins. Completion of the transcervical margin samples in the area of the base of the tongue and the pharyngeal side wall. These are completely assessed as tumor- and dysplasia-free in frozen section diagnostics. Therefore, an R0 resection can now be assumed for completely imaged margin samples. This results in a wide pharyngeal defect. Measurement of the pharyngeal defect and design of the flap format. Based on the tongue resection, the decision is now made to remove a transfemoral graft. At the same time, the neck is dissected on the left side. Neck dissection. Skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical artery, the superior thyroid artery, the facial vein and the hypoglossal nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Clearing of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches and the cervical artery. Subsequent evacuation of the accessorius triangle with careful protection and exposure of the nerve. Followed by careful wound inspection and, if the wound is dry, wound irrigation. Insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Elevation of the transfemoral graft. After marking the orientation marks and identifying the intermuscular septum, the skin perforators are now identified using Doppler sonography. This is extremely laborious. It is only possible to identify a small perforator in the mid-thigh area using Doppler sonography. Decision for exploration. Marking of the graft. This is specially configured for the base of the tongue and soft palate, with a total length of 15 cm and a width of up to 6 cm. Medial incision. Cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the thigh fascia. Expose and secure the rectus femoris muscle. Now inspect the intermuscular septum. It can be seen that there is no perforator in the intermuscular septum between the vastus lateralis and the rectus femoris. However, from the septum, between the intermedius and the lateral vastus, a perforator can be seen entering the graft at an identified point; with very strong vessels of the lateral femoral artery medially, the decision is now made to explore the perforator with the possibility of a perforator flap if necessary. Tracing of the slender perforator after tracing under the intermedius muscle. Rapid increase in perforator thickness with opening into the extremely strong vascular pedicle. Therefore complete dissolution of the intermedius muscle. Identification and dissection of a further, even smaller perforator. Complete release from the muscle and thus preparation of a perforator flap. Isolation of the graft on the vascular pedicle and placement of the vital graft, also isolation on a strong artery and vein. Careful wound inspection and irrigation. Then insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, multi-layer wound closure with resection of excess skin. The graft is then inserted. This is done transorally and transcervically. Overall good fit with complete coverage of the defect. Upon insertion, the left canine tooth is loose, with an overall marod tooth status. This was extirpated. However, further inspection reveals a tooth status with several loose teeth that is in great need of restoration. Insertion of the graft. Dense conditions on all sides. Therefore, conditioning of the neck vessels on the right for anastomosis. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery and the superior thyroid vein, which has excellent flow through the caudally preserved internal jugular vein. Conditioning of the flap vessels. Perform the arterial anastomosis with 8-0 Ethilon. This is successful and immediately sufficient. Tight conditions in the area of the anastomosis and immediate regular venous return. Therefore conditioning of the superior thyroid vein. Measurement of a size 4-0 coupler and easy passage of the venous anastomosis with the coupler system. Subsequently, regular circulation and pulsation with excellent graft perfusion. Therefore, after final wound inspection, insertion of a guided 10 Redon drain and subsequent careful, two-layer wound closure. The tracheotomy was performed at the same time. For this, a skin incision was made approx. 1 cm below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and splitting of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and incision of the tracheostoma with mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequent problem-free intubation onto a size 8 low-cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. Final inspection. Vital graft. Repositioning of the patient and completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT3 cN2c oral cavity/oropharyngeal carcinoma. Complex reconstruction due to the anatomical conditions, flap size and defect location. Extended radical neck dissection and tumor resection on the right with additional resection of the hypoglossal nerve and the lingual nerve.","Resection, Neck dissection

Subsequently, transition to transoral tumor resection. After adjusting the oropharynx with the tonsil retractor, a somewhat uneven mucosa can be seen in the area of the left tonsil. An exophytic or easily palpable tumor is not visible. If a caudal view of the lateral pharyngeal wall is possible with the retractor, a caudal tissue sample is taken to determine the extent of the carcinoma, which is not clearly visible. This sample proves positive in the frozen section histological diagnosis. Then start with monopolar tumor resection on the left side. The entire tonsil lobe is resected successively, starting at the parauvular left upper tonsil pole and removing the left anterior palatine arch and the adjacent posterior palatine arch with transition to the medial posterior hypopharyngeal wall. The entire musculature up to the soft tissues of the neck and the adjacent vessels is successively resected caudally. About 3/4 of the tumor is developed transorally downwards as far as possible. Subsequently, marginal sections are removed from the posterior wall of the hypopharynx, from the upper tonsil pole and from the lateral margin. Isolated tumor cell nests can still be found caudally in the area of the lateral margin, the remaining resected sections are tumor-free. Further excision will then be performed transcervically after completion of the neck dissection. Transition to neck dissection on the left side. A large fixed metastasis can already be palpated at the junction of regions II and III. After skin incision, dissection of the skin platysma flap laterally. The platysma is incised over the metastasis so that the skin can finally be moved laterally. Locate the vascular nerve sheath under the omohyoid muscle caudally. Trace the omohyoid muscle ventrally upwards. Then expose the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. Also expose the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. It can now be seen that the entire tumor block has even reached the caudal submandibular gland. Therefore, this is first removed by dissecting the facial vein and the facial artery while identifying and protecting the lingual nerve. In this way, the tumor block can be successively developed laterally starting at the submandibular gland while exposing and sparing the hypoglossal nerve. The external carotid artery, the carotid bifurcation and the common carotid artery are then exposed and released. The internal jugular vein is completely infiltrated, as are the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the accessorius nerve. Therefore, the internal jugular vein is deposited under the posterior belly of the digastric muscle after it has been found at the base of the skull. The internal jugular vein is also removed caudally in the area at the level of the clavicle. Dissection of the large tumor block and removal of the insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the tip of the mastoid. It is now apparent that the entire neck is full of hard nodular metastases down to the depth of the brachial plexus. The resection is therefore carried out as extensively as necessary and possible. The entire tumor block is successively resected radically, resecting all branches of the cervical plexus. Follow the tumor masses caudally, exposing and skeletonizing the phrenic nerve. The last metastasis is dissected free from the subclavian vein under traction. This leaves only the common carotid artery, the vagus nerve and the hypoglossal nerve on the left neck. Then widening of the opening in the neck and disluxation of the partially resected tumor. Then complete the tumor resection with parts of the base of the tongue and the remaining lateral to ................................. margin. This shows that the tumor has in principle grown through the lateral pharyngeal wall per continuitatem to the external carotid artery and can be detached from this in a healthy layer. After resection of an extensive section of the base of the tongue, as it is also affected by frozen section histology, all marginal sections of the base of the tongue as well as the remaining caudal and lateral hypopharyngeal wall are then tumor-free. Subsequent transition to elevation of the radial lobe graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (13 cm x 5.5 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Covering of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Now transition to neck dissection on the right side. Here, regions I-V are also selectively removed while preserving all lymphatic structures. Here too, a large lymph node metastasis is found in region II. The facial artery is then dissected beyond the lower jaw so that it can later be used for anastomosis. The V. facialis is also dissected as far beyond the mandible as possible while sparing the ramus marginalis mandibulae and cut caudally. After removal of the radialis graft, it is first sutured transcervically in the area of the base of the tongue and the caudal lateral hypopharyngeal wall at the level of the epiglottis and the vallecula. The remaining sutures are then performed transorally. After creating a transition to the opposite side, the flap pedicle is then transferred to the opposite side at the level of the hyoid. Here the arterial anastomosis of the radial artery to the facial artery is performed. The venous outflow is connected to the facial vein in an end-to-side manner via a vein in the flap. The 2nd humeral vein has a corresponding length so that it can be connected to the internal jugular vein on the right side in an end-to-side manner. A Redon suction drain and a drainage flap are then placed on the right side. Multi-layer wound closure. Completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis of the tracheostoma. Re-intubation of the patient. End of the operation, transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Resection of a tonsillar carcinoma on the left side cT3 with radical neck dissection on the left and selective neck dissection region I-V on the right side. Reconstruction with a microvascularly anastomosed radial flap from the left forearm, which is inserted into the orohypopharyngeal defect on the left side and whose stalk is anastomosed to the right vascular nerve sheath. Due to the extensive tumor findings, adjuvant radiochemotherapy is strongly recommended.","Resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy, PEG placement

PEG insertion: insertion of the esophagoscope into the stomach. No abnormalities found during a thorough examination. After diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube in a typical manner without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the tumor region. Insertion of the McIVOR oral spatula and inspection of the tumor region. The tumor starts on the soft palate parauvularly on the right and extends over the tonsillar lobe to the base of the tongue, it also grows into the edge of the tongue on the right side. Now sterile washing and draping. Start with transoral tumor resection. Here the operation is performed with an electric needle and partly with scissors and bipolar forceps. In the area of the base of the tongue, the overview is so difficult that it is no longer possible to operate transorally. Now create an apron flap and expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and submandibular gland. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and exposure of the hyoid bone and continuation of the tumor resection from transcervical. To do this, the digastric muscle must be cut and the tumor must be luted through from transoral to cervical. Then successively cut around the tumor in the tongue base area so that the tumor can be completely resected en bloc with a safety margin of 1.5 cm. The tumor preparation is placed on cork and marked as a whole for frozen section. All tumor margins are assessed as free. Now complete the neck dissection on the right side. For this, free preparation of the internal jugular vein, the facial vein and the external jugular vein. There are several large metastases in level II a and b. Part of the cervical plexus must also be removed as the metastases are fused to it and the accessorius cannot be preserved either. The border cord of the vagus nerve and the hypoglossal nerve can be preserved. Then send in the neck dissection level individually as part of the lymph node study. On the opposite side, neck dissection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is also visualized for this. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, the accessorius nerve and clearing of the neck levels II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. The neck levels are also sent in individually as part of the lymph node study. Repositioning for tracheotomy. Perform a visor tracheotomy between the second and third tracheal cartilage through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and create a mucocutaneous anastomosis. Lifting of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Parallel to this, lift the split skin from the right thigh with the dermatome 7.5 mm. Then dissection of the neck vessels under the microscope on the right side. The external jugular vein, the facial vein with one outlet and the superior thyroid artery are dissected. The lingual artery was resected as part of the tumor resection and is dissected as a stump for the anastomosis. Then transfer of the operation to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Elevation of the radialis graft: Marking of the graft (6 x 11 cm) on the distal forearm. Incision of the graft and transection of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue and the forearm fascia. Exposure of the confluence in the crook of the elbow and dissection along the cephalic vein to the radial flap edge. Integration of the cephalic vein into the graft. Raise the cephalic vein and expose the external ramus of the radial nerve. Ulnar preparation subfascially up to the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Locate the distal stump of the radial artery. Undermining with a clamp and clamping of the radial artery. A good perfusion signal can be recorded the entire time. Dissection of the radial artery and ligation of the stumps. Elevation of the radial artery flap from the wound bed, with constant bipolar coagulation of smaller vessels and placement of vascular clips. This is done while protecting the radial nerve. Dissection of the blood vessels in the crook of the elbow and removal of the flap, first of the artery and then of the vein. Lifting of the graft without complications. Wound closure using split skin from the lower leg by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Then insertion of the radial flap: The radial flap is inserted into the defect and successively sutured into the defect both transcervically and transorally, partly with the sutures in place. This is achieved without tension using 3-0 Vicryl single-button sutures followed by dissection of the superior thyroid artery and an outlet from the internal jugular vein as well as dissection of the external jugular vein. All vessels are conditioned for vascular anastomosis. After conditioning the radial artery anastomosis, this is then connected to the superior thyroid artery. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. Then conditioning of the cephalic veins. One is anastomosed with the external jugular vein using a 3.5 mm vessel coupler. After opening the clamps, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The second smaller part of the superficial venous outflow is anastomosed with the outlet from the internal jugular vein using a 2-0 coupler. Here too, good venous return after opening the clamps. Positive smear phenomenon. A small outlet, which corresponds to the confluence, is clipped. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Inspection of the flap shows good perfusion. Extensive irrigation and hemostasis. Wound closure in layers and epithelialization of the tracheostoma, insertion of a Redon drain on the left and 2 flaps on the right. The forearm was treated in the typical manner with a Mepilex swab dressing and fixed and attached to a Cramer splint. A hydrogel dressing was applied to the thigh area. The tracheostomy tube was fixed with sutures. The procedure was completed without complications. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue the antibiotic treatment started intraoperatively for approx. 1 week. Nutrition via the inserted PEG tube for 7-10 days. Then gruel and, if necessary, build up the diet. Monitoring of the flap for 5 days by Doppler or clinically. Heparin 500 E/h as a perfusor for 5 days.

This is successful without any problems. Mirroring up to the carina. This is clear on all sides. In the area of the posterior tracheal wall, a small induration or protrusion can be seen paramedian to the left about 5 cm subglottically. This is not exophytic and does not appear primarily suspicious for malignancy. Then problem-free intubation by the surgeon. Positioning by the surgeon. Esophagogastroscopy is performed first. Enter with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Mirroring into the stomach without any problems. Here, food residues are clearly visible, but after aspiration of these, the mucosal conditions are unremarkable on all sides. On endoscopy, clear mucosal changes in the sense of reflux esophagitis are noticeable. Otherwise, however, no exophytic masses. Now enter with the small bore tube. Inspection of the hypopharynx. The hypopharynx is clearly visible up to the esophageal entrance, even the postcricoid region is clear without exophytic masses. No suspicious changes in the area of the base of the tongue, vallecula and epiglottis. Adjustment of the endolarynx. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions without exophytic tumor growth. Inspection of the oral cavity. A coarse, whitish, circumscribed change in the right glossotonsillar groove is seen in the area of the transition to the alveolar ridge anteriorly on the edge of the tongue, the mucosa is slightly reddened and uneven and leads to clearly leukoplakic changes in the area of the edge of the tongue, transitioning to the floor of the mouth, with whitish, non-wipeable coatings. The decision is made to excise the suspicious, indurated mass, which, however, does not move into the base of the tongue on palpation, while at the same time taking the suspicious mucosal changes anteriorly. Now first insert the mouth retractor and mark the resection margins with the electric needle. Dissection with scissors, removing the mucosal changes in the area of the tumorous changes. Removal of the mucosa and the underlying submucosal tissue up to the former tonsil lobe or base of the tongue. All preparation steps under careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. The preparation is now marked with sutures. It extends from the right glossotonsillar groove over the alveolar ridge to the anterior third of the right edge of the tongue, passing over to the floor of the mouth. This is followed by thread marking in the anterior (long/long) and lateral (short/short) directions. Representative edge samples are then taken in the area of the anterior edge of the tongue as well as halfway along the area of the floor of the mouth transition and the back of the tongue medially and finally a resection in the area of the cranial tonsil lobe. Then renewed careful inspection and hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Insertion of hydrogen and Ringer swabs. Meticulous hemostasis. Finally, absolutely dry wound conditions.

Histology revealed a carcinoma in situ on the right alveolar ridge and a G3 differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and carcinoma in situ on the right anterior palatal arch. Post-resection with intraoperative frozen section diagnostics was discussed at the interdisciplinary tumor conference.,"Team time out and induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues with intubation. Dental status determined. Insertion of the Mc Ivor oral spatula and exposure of the right oropharynx: A slightly rough, spherical protrusion with smooth mucosa, approx. 0.8 cm in diameter, can be seen in the area of the former ablation on the anterior right palatal arch. Laterocaudally, the alveolar ridge is somewhat exposed after previous surgery. In addition, there is a leukoplakia on the right posterior palatal arch, which was not present 4 weeks ago, measuring approx. 3 x 6 mm longitudinally oval. No other new mucosal abnormalities in the rest of the oropharynx. Infiltration of the anterior and posterior right palatal arch with local anesthesia, Ultracaine 2% with the addition of Suprarenin. Now excision biopsy of the leukoplakia on the right posterior palatal arch with a 5 mm safety margin using a scalpel and pointed scissors. Suture marking still in the surgical site at 12 o'clock (cranial) and at 9 o'clock (lateral). The frozen section examination according to the telephone announcement by the pathologists shows a 2 cm large carcinoma in situ in the resectate, whereby a marginal formation in the frozen section at 12 o'clock cannot be ruled out, thus recommendation for subsequent resection, which takes place later. First, the already planned resection on the anterior palatal arch on the right: with a safety margin of approx. 5 mm, the raised, rough mass is cut around with the scalpel and pointed scissors on a smooth mucosal surface. Here too, suture marking in the surgical site at 6 o'clock (caudal) and 9 o'clock (lateral). The required size of the resection results in a defect in the anterior palatal arch, which is later adapted. According to the pathology department, the frozen section examination shows an invasive carcinoma of 0.2 cm originating from the CIS, which forms the cranial margin and also a moderate degree of dysplasia laterally, whereby it cannot be clearly distinguished from the CIS in the frozen section. Therefore recommendation for resection here as well. Preoperative demonstration to the previous surgeon <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Now case discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, also based on the tumor conference decision, see file. Now indication for subsequent resection at the above-mentioned sites in accordance with the pathological recommendation, this time for definitive histology as well as an additional biopsy on the left anterior palatal arch in macroscopically unremarkable conditions to clarify whether a carcinoma in situ is also present here in the current case of field carcinomatization. Then discussion at the tumor conference and no PEG placement today. Now follow-up resections: Posterior palatal arch on the right: cranial resection of an approx. 5 mm wide strip of mucosa using a scalpel and pointed scissors. This is marked with sutures in the operating theater, both medially and cranially. Send in for definitive histology. Right anterior palatal arch resection: resection of a 5 mm wide strip of mucosa using a scalpel and pointed scissors, covering the entire area from medial to cranial to laterocaudal, triple suture markings. Sketch/photo with all markings see file. Finally, the right anterior palatal arch is adapted into the wound bed with Vicryl 4-0. No bleeding. In addition, biopsy of the left anterior palatal arch. No bleeding. Finally, insertion of a nasogastric feeding tube due to the extensive resection defect in the right oropharynx. Position control under direct vision and auscultatory with air insufflation. The procedure was completed without complications. Conclusion: Post-resection of the anterior right palatal arch for invasive squamous cell carcinoma originating from a carcinoma in situ and excisional biopsy of the posterior right palatal arch for carcinoma in situ; frozen section control. An additional resection of both sites was performed and will be followed by definitive histology. In case of suspected field carcinoma, biopsy of the left anterior palatal arch in a pale mucosal area. Procedure: Discussion in the tumor conference of the definitive histologies of the frozen section and the post-resectates. A PEG was deliberately avoided (see above). A PEG should only be inserted if radiochemotherapy is definitely indicated. Nasogastric tube in the right oropharynx for 3-5 days depending on the findings.","Excisional biopsy

Careful hemostasis. Removal of numerous marginal samples, which are found to be tumor-free in the frozen section histology. Very difficult dissection overall due to the size of the tumor. However, as far as can be assessed intraoperatively, the tumor can be completely removed from the healthy tissue, so that no further measures are required at this time. However, this patient must undergo regular check-ups and must be informed accordingly. Now careful hemostasis. Closure of the thyroid cartilage by suturing after a total of 4 perforations of the thyroid cartilage. Reconstruction of the ligamentum conicum. Insertion of a flap. Wound closure in layers. Finally, a coarse needle biopsy of the left thyroid nodule is performed under sonographic control. Exposure of the thyroid nodule and corresponding coarse needle biopsy. Finally, a gastric tube is inserted into the patient. Completion of the procedure. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Very difficult dissection conditions due to the anatomy and size of the tumor. Close monitoring is absolutely essential.","Partial laryngectomy, PE (Parathyroidectomy) thyroid gland

The palatine tonsil is not reached clinically. The midline is far away on palpation. The base of the tongue is infiltrated on the right side in the upper third about 2 cm cranial to the vallecula. Now the remaining hypopharynx, the vallecula, the epiglottis and the endolarynx are reflected. Inconspicuous conditions here. Then adjust the tongue with the self-retaining retractor and rein suture. Determination of the resection margins, which are clinically clearly in the healthy area. Then resection of the tongue tumor with the electric needle and in between with bipolar coagulation and scissors. The tumor preparation can be resected en bloc. The lingual artery does not have to be resected and the hypoglossal nerve is not exposed. The tumor specimen is now marked with sutures and is then sent to the frozen section. The medial edge, the lateral edge and the base of the tongue are each thread-marked. During the operation, the pathology department informs the surgeon that the specimen has been resected R0. Now hemostasis with the bipolar forceps. Laterally, it can be seen that a part of the palatine tonsil is also removed in the sense of a generous resection. Precise hemostasis here. Subsequent insertion of hydrogen swabs and turning to neck dissection on the right. Ultrasonographic status here cN2b ............2. Now instillation of 10 ml xylocaine without adrenaline in the area of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Abjode, sterile draping and skin incision. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Ligation of the external jugular vein and transection of the same. Now expose the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery as well as the vagus nerve. It can now be seen that the cranial accessorius nerve extends into the neck metastasis at level 2. This metastasis virtually fills the upper accessorius triangle. The decision was made to resect the accessory nerve and to partially resect the sternocleidomastoid muscle in this region. Sharp detachment of the tumor metastasis from the upper accessorius triangle while sparing the vascular structures. This is successful. Now better view of the internal jugular vein. Sharp removal of the tumor conglomerate from the digaster venter posterior muscle. The V. is then exposed from caudal to cranial and finally the entire posterior neck preparation is removed while sparing the plexus branches. Now expose the hypoglossal nerve. Then complete the anterior neck by removing the capsule of the submandibular gland and anterior lymphatic tissue. Now expose the common carotid artery, the outlet of the internal carotid artery and the external carotid artery. Identify the superior thyroid artery, the lingual artery and the facial artery. The lingual artery is now effectively ligated. Subsequent irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer's solution, followed by hemostasis and placement of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure and repositioning to the opposite side. Here also instillation of 10 ml xylocaine and addition of adrenaline. Skin incision in the area of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the cranial accessorius nerve. The omohyoid muscle caudally, the cervical vascular sheath in the sense of the internal jugular vein, common carotid artery and vagus nerve. Now expose the accessorius nerve and finally free the upper accessorius triangle. Finally, detach the posterior neck preparation while sparing the plexus branches. Complete the anterior neck by removing the capsule of the submandibular gland and the remaining lymphatic tissue. The vagus nerve is also exposed. Subsequent irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and, after meticulous hemostasis, two-layer wound closure. Now repositioning for tracheotomy: modified Kocher collar incision, dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and cutting of prethyroid veins. Subsequent exposure of the cricoid cartilage and undermining of the thyroid isthmus. Removal of the latter after repositioning, exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea and insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a Björk flap in ................. and epithelization of the tracheostoma. A 9-gauge tracheostomy tube is finally inserted. The patient receives Unacid 3 x 3 g intravenously. Finally, the swabs are again removed from the mouth area, blood is stopped again and the open wound edges are adapted using Vicryl sutures.","Partial glossectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement

Histologically, this tumor was found to be a squamous cell carcinoma. As a result, the decision was made to resect part of the larynx from the outside due to the difficulty in adjusting it. It is noteworthy in the case history that the tumor was also treated in 2006 with a partial laryngectomy from the outside.","Introductory consultation with the anesthetist. Local anesthesia is administered prelaryngeally in the soft tissues of the neck. Ablation and covering of the surgical area. Re-entry into the old scar, which is very difficult due to scarring changes. Exposure of the laryngeal framework, exposure of the thyroid cartilage, exposure of the cricoid cartilage. The ligamentum conicum is largely ossified. Dissect the scar tissue from the thyroid cartilage and open the thyroid cartilage with the wheel in the median line. Opening of the larynx by insertion of a spreader. The tumor can be seen in the area of the right larynx. The tumor is located on the vocal fold. The resection areas of the trial biopsy are also visible. After exposure of the tumor, resection of the tumor, in which the inner perichondrium of the thyroid cartilage is removed and the surface of the vocal fold is also resected. The entire supraglottic region up to the petiolus of the epiglottis and laterally beyond on the right are successively resected, whereby the arytenoid cartilage is skeletonized. This results in a partial laryngeal resection, which includes in particular the supraglottic region up to the aryepiglottic fold. Parts of the aryepiglottic fold are also resected. Removal of marginal samples after the preparation has also been marked. This shows that isolated tumor parts are still detectable on the vocal fold surface. A resection is performed in the area of the vocal fold and the vocal process, the arytenoid cartilage. Corresponding marginal samples are taken and then found to be tumor-free in the frozen section examination. Careful hemostasis. The vocal fold is readapted on the front right at the anterior commissure to create a newly shaped vocal fold after approx. 50% of the volume of the vocalis muscle and the vocal ligament has been resected. Closure of the thyroid cartilage after drilling appropriate holes. Wound closure in layers. Insertion of a flap. Application of a pressure bandage. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Postoperatively, particular attention must be paid to the patient's swallowing function. Close follow-up examinations are absolutely essential. Overall, very difficult surgical conditions due to the pre-resection. Note: Close inspection of the left larynx revealed no pathological findings.","Partial laryngeal resection

A sample was taken from the middle to dorsal left glottis. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma G3 was diagnosed. Further diagnostics revealed mobile arytenoid cartilage on both sides, particularly on the left, and cartilage infiltration could not be ruled out on CT, but this could not be clearly confirmed on ultrasound. Overall, detailed explanatory discussion with the patient. In any case, the patient wanted the operation to preserve the larynx. However, due to the location of the tumor dorsally in the arytenoid region and the extent of the tumor that could not be clearly determined during panendoscopy due to poor adjustability, the patient was also informed about the possibility of a laryngectomy. Patient is rather opposed to a laryngectomy and would only accept it in an extreme emergency. Requests partial laryngectomy. After a detailed discussion, the patient also accepts a possible swallowing disorder due to a partial laryngectomy in exchange for the possibility of initially preserving the residual larynx and then attempting to compensate for the swallowing disorder by means of swallowing exercises. Overall agreement to attempt partial laryngectomy, even accepting a possible long-term swallowing disorder. The patient only agrees to laryngectomy if it is oncologically impossible to preserve the larynx. Sonographic cN0 status.","First orotracheal intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. The site is then covered as for a possible laryngectomy with neck dissection on both sides. This is followed by a Z-shaped incision and a small Kocher collar incision. The larynx is exposed via the Z-shaped incision. To do this, dissect through the subcutaneous tissue down to the infrahyoid musculature, which is split. Then dissect the perichondrium from right to left on the left side. Then split the larynx median. Entering the larynx anteriorly. The larynx is then inspected. The fibrin-covered area at the level of the arytenoid cartilage, where the sample had been taken and the G3 carcinoma had been confirmed, can be seen at the back. A macroscopic growth is extremely difficult to delineate with almost inconspicuous mucosa. Therefore, the resection was started slightly dorsal to the anterior part of the left vocal cord and immediately extended to the cartilage. This was because a cartilage infiltration could not be ruled out on CT, but this could not be clearly confirmed on ultrasound. Removal of the entire soft tissue from the cartilage below the perichondrium to the dorsal region of the arytenoid cartilage. Most of this is also resected. The posterior upper parts remain. Resection caudally up to the subglottic slope and cranially including parts of the pouch ligament. Dorsal removal of the largest parts of the arytenoid cartilage. The aryepiglottic fold is only slightly affected. The specimen is removed in toto and marked with sutures, especially dorsally and basally. A marginal sample is taken from the mucosa in the arytenoid region and soft tissue from the dorsal arytenoid region. The entire specimen and the 2 marginal samples are sent for frozen section. In the frozen section, the tumor is removed from the healthy area and the marginal samples are also healthy. Due to dysplastic extensions to the subglottic and anterior regions, it is recommended to take corresponding resections in these regions. Therefore, the remaining parts of the anterior left vocal cord up to the anterior commissure and the attached soft tissue are removed. A further mucosal sample is then taken from the entire subglottic area from anterior to posterior. No more dysplasia in the frozen section. Overall, including the marginal samples, R0 resection. This is followed by very careful hemostasis. A tracheotomy had already been performed before the tumor resection. For this purpose, a Kocher's collar incision was made slightly dorsally and after dissection through subcutaneous tissue, the infrahyoid musculature was pushed apart, the isthmus was cut and treated with puncture ligatures. After exposing the trachea, the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space is entered and a visor flap is created. This was then epithelialized. The tumor resection was then performed as described above. After creation of the R0 resection, very careful hemostasis and closure of the larynx. For this purpose, the remaining parts of the arytenoid cartilage were first sutured dorsally to the soft tissue of the arytenoid fold to improve stability. Then fixation of the remains of the anteriormost parts of the right vocal cord to the cartilage using 4-0 Vicryl single-button sutures. After making 3 drill holes, closure of the thyroid cartilage with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Stable closure. Then close the ligamentum conicum with 4-0 Vicryl single button sutures. The left perichondrium soft tissue flap is then swung over around the laryngeal skeleton. This is sutured to the remaining soft tissue on the right side of the larynx with 4-0 Vicryl single button sutures so that the laryngeal skeleton is completely closed with soft tissue. Then suture the infrahyoid musculature. Suture of subcutaneous tissue. Insertion of a flap and skin suture. Subsequent completion of the epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Neck dissection left level II to IV: skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue and dissection through the platysma. Dissection in a subplatysmal manner and discovery of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The external jugular vein is ligated. Expose the accessorius nerve and spare it. Now locate the omohyoid muscle and follow it cranially. Expose the submandibular gland. Expose the gland and elevate the gland using Langenbeck to spare the marginal ramus of the facial nerve. Exposure of the posterior venter of the digastric muscle up to level II. Now also exposure of the cervical vascular nerve sheath and vagus nerve with preservation of all the structures mentioned. Now dissection of level IIb, here a relatively large mass in the sense of a lymph node is seen, which is successively dissected. Dissection in a caudal direction so that a total of levels IIa and b, level III and level IV are removed. Successive development and removal of the lateral neck preparation. The cervical plexus can be spared without any problems, also removal of level V. Further free preparation of the cervical sheath and development of the medial neck preparation while sparing the hypoglossal nerve. There is increased bleeding, not even after a Valsalva attempt, for this reason insertion of a Redon drainage and two-layer wound closure. Then reintubation, insertion of a 7 mm tracheal cannula. Insertion of a nasogastric tube to feed the patient. The procedure is then completed without complications. Patient admitted to intensive care unit for one night for postoperative monitoring. Nutrition initially for a few days via the nasogastric tube. Then carefully build up the diet. A swallowing disorder may well be present and may also be somewhat protracted. Therefore, if there are problems with swallowing, start swallowing training at an early stage. Overall, glottic carcinoma is difficult to diagnose cT1 to cT2 in terms of its extent with rather microscopic findings. Due to the tumor location and G3 stage, neck dissection level II to IV was performed on the left. Further procedure after receipt of the final histology. Then presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference. A follow-up MLE in 8-12 weeks seems sensible in any case.","Partial laryngeal resection, Left neck dissection, Tracheostomy creation

Not crossing the midline. The above procedure is therefore indicated.,"Transfer of the patient to the operating theater. Consultation with the anesthetist. Subsequent transoral tumor resection: After appropriate preparation, insertion of the mouth retractors. Rein suture of the tip of the tongue and disluxation of the tongue. The tumor located on the right middle edge of the tongue is then resected with scissors in the sense of a hemiglossectomy and macroscopically far into the healthy tissue. Repeated careful hemostasis and bipolar coagulation and ligation of several larger arterial branches. The specimen is sent for frozen section histology diagnostics and is found to have been resected well within the healthy tissue. After completion of the tumor resection, measurement of the defect with a size of about 8 x 4 1/2 cm. Transition to neck dissection on both sides and elevation of the radial lobe graft from the left forearm. Subsequent repositioning for neck dissection on both sides and defect coverage. Sterile draping of all surgical areas. Injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline per side of the neck. Neck dissection on the right: incision in a submandibular neck fold. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle and infrahyoid muscles. Visualization of the internal jugular vein, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, visualization of the superior thyroid artery and facial artery. There is no adequate external jugular vein. However, there is a good facial artery with several outlets. Clearing of the lymph nodes level II to IV, including visualization of the cervical artery, vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. All nerves are exposed, dissected out and re-embedded. Several slightly enlarged lymph nodes, but none clearly positive. Neck dissection on the left side: This is performed in the same way as on the right side. Levels II to IV are removed in the same way. Some enlarged lymph nodes are also found here. The radial lobe graft is then removed. Removal of the radial lobe (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Measurement of the defect in the area of the oral cavity. After glossectomy, the defect is 8 x 4 cm. A spindle-shaped graft is drawn in the area of the forearm, palpation of the radial and ulnar arteries. Draw the cephalic vein from the proximal end of the graft in a curved line to the crook of the elbow, then make an incision in the opposite direction in the proximal part of the forearm approx. 7 x 3 cm so that after removal of the radial flap, full-thickness skin is obtained from the forearm and used to close the resulting defect in the radial flap. Now incise the skin using a 15 mm scalpel, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the proximal end of the flap. Expose the brachioradialis muscle and the flexor carpis radialis muscle. Exposure of the pedicle between the muscle bellies. Exposure of the V. mediana cubita, in the crook of the elbow exposure of the V. confluens, exposure of the V. cephalica. The cephalic vein is dissected so that it is integrated into the flap. After complete dissection of the vascular pedicle with 2 deep veins and the radial artery, the skin around the graft is incised. The flap is now dissected in such a way that the vascular pedicle is integrated medially or radially of the flexor carpi radialis. The radial artery is then exposed using clamps and wrapped around with lateral sutures. This tests whether the oxygenation decreases when the radial artery is squeezed. The findings are correct with a sufficient increase in flow through the ulnar artery, so that there is no drop in saturation when the radial artery is squeezed. The remaining flap is now incised, the superficial ramus of the radial nerve is exposed and preserved. The smallest branches that run to the flap are not preserved, but the main branch of the superficial ramus and radial nerve is preserved. All vessels are now exposed in the antecubital fossa and the flap is removed at the distal end. The radial artery is ligated using lateral sutures, the radial artery is removed proximally and the ulnar and brachial arteries are identified and spared. The interosseous artery is separated from the radial artery and integrated into the flap. The cephalic artery is removed proximal to the confluence so that the accompanying veins of the vascular pedicle, the confluent vein and the cephalic vein can be spared and integrated into the flap. The flap is now removed proximally. In the proximal area of the forearm, a spindle-shaped excision of skin is performed as described above and dissected away from the fatty tissue. A 7 x 3 cm full-thickness skin graft can now be sutured into the radial flap defect without difficulty. Proximally, the forearm is primarily closed, double-layered subcutaneous suture using 4-0 Vicryl and continuous skin suture using 5-0 Ethilon. The full-thickness skin is sutured with 4-0 Ethilon. Four small relief incisions are now made to prevent hematoma. Bepanthen ointment is then applied, compresses are sewn in and the arm is bandaged and a dorsal forearm splint is applied in the typical manner. Then incision of the radialis flap: First create a tunnel from the right side of the neck into the oral cavity area. To do this, cut the digastric muscle. Then removal of the submandibular gland. Careful protection and exposure, re-embedding of the lingual nerve. A 2-3 QF tunnel is created in the floor of the mouth. The radialis flap graft is then sutured into the defect with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Tension-free and complete defect coverage. The stalk was previously passed through the tunnel into the neck area on the right side. Here the radial artery and the lingual artery, which is prepared, are used for anastomosis. After conditioning the vessels, suturing is performed using single button sutures 9-0 Ethilon. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow and good venous return. Subsequently, 2 outlets are exposed from the area of the accompanying vein of the radial artery, which have good venous flow. The branches of the cephalic vein have significantly poorer venous flow and are therefore clipped. The veins from the confluence area are anastomosed with 2 veins from the outlet of the facial vein using 2.5 mm and 2.0 mm couplers. Good venous flow after opening the clamps. Positive smear phenomenon. Inspection of the flap enorally, this shows good blood flow. Subsequent clipping of all still open venous outlets. Most careful hemostasis and irrigation. Then wound closure in layers with insertion of 2 flaps on the right side and a Redon drainage on the left side. Due to the swelling, an enoral decision was made to perform a small tracheostomy. Now tracheotomy: skin incision approx. 5 cm long 1 QF below the cricoid horizontally. Sharp cutting of the skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma using a 15 mm scalpel. The infrahyoid musculature is now exposed. Entering the midline. Cut through the midline with scissors. Expose the thyroid gland. An Overholt clamp is used to enter between the cricoid and isthmus. The isthmus of the thyroid gland is easily bipolarized and severed. A small tracheotomy is then performed between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasp so that a 7-gauge cannula can be inserted. Mucocutaneous anastomosis is performed with Ethibond sutures in the typical manner. Completion of the procedure without complications. Subsequent completion of the procedure without complications. Flap vital at the end of the operation, wound conditions normal. Patient transferred to the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation. Please continue antibiotics, which were started intraoperatively with Unacid, for 1 week postoperatively. Nutrition via the preoperatively inserted gastric tube for approx. 1 week to 10 days, then, depending on the clinical situation, diet build-up. Flap control according to the scheme for 5 days. Please run heparin perfusor 500 E/h for 5 days.

For this reason, placement of the accesses and the permanent catheter from the anesthesia. Injection, sterile ablation and draping. Marking the landmarks. Skin incision in a zigzag shape and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature and separation from it in the linea alba. Exposure of the larynx from the thyroid incisura to the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the larynx in the sense of a dissection of the periosteum. Now saw open the larynx paramedian on the right side and cut the ligamentum conicum at this point. Open the larynx and inspect it. The larynx is opened paramedianally on the right side in order to be able to resect the anterior commissure and the anterior part of the right vocal fold. No tumor is now macroscopically visible here. The larynx is stretched open and the tumor is followed to the left side. Here the tumor is successively removed with the pointed scissors and the 15 mm scalpel as well as bipolar coagulation at a distance of approx. 1 cm. Basally, the thyroid cartilage is completely exposed and freed from the periosteum with the Freer. This is done without any problems and can be pushed off easily. Now successive further dissection of the tumor under suture marking and taking of the marginal samples during the resection. The proc vocalis of the arytenoid cartilage is infiltrated in the posterior region. For this reason, add <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. As the remaining part of the arytenoid cartilage can remain in place and swallowing should therefore be possible and a tracheostomy should be avoided, the vocal process is removed and the remaining arytenoid cartilage is left in place. Now take circular margin samples. Make 4 drill holes through the thyroid cartilage. Careful hemostasis and waiting for the frozen section. This was found to be tumor-free everywhere, with infiltrates only visible in the paraglottic space on the left side. This is resected again and circular margin samples are taken again. These are again sent for frozen section and are tumor-free. An R0 situation can therefore be assumed in the frozen section. It must be expressly mentioned here that the resection was performed with restraint at the express wish of the patient in order to protect the arytenoid cartilage and avoid a permanent tracheostomy. A further resection would have led to an opening of the pharynx and thus to a laryngectomy, which the patient also refused. In the current R0 situation, suture the right vocal fold anteriorly to improve vocal fold tension and successive hemostasis. Pharyngeal mucosa is visible on the left side, but is intact. Insertion of fibrin glue. Now suture the ligamentum conicum to the thyroid cartilage and insert a Keel. Closure of the prelaryngeal musculature as well as the subcutaneous fatty tissue and skin after insertion of a flap. Now insertion of a nasogastric tube and demonstration of the findings to the anesthesia colleagues. End of the operation. Conclusion: V.a. cT2 cN0 cM0 transglottic laryngeal carcinoma on the left side. Neck dissection on both sides was omitted due to the cN0 neck status after consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The frozen section showed an R0 resection. The final histology should be awaited and the patient should be presented at the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","MLE (Microlaryngoscopy and Endoscopy), Attempted partial laryngeal resection (Leroux Robert)

The tumor was found to be laser resectable at the pre-panendoscopy. Histologically squamous cell carcinoma. The above-mentioned operation was therefore indicated.,"First positioning of the head, insertion of the mouthguard and insertion of the MLE tube size C and D alternately. The tumor, which is located in the area of the left vocal fold, is revealed. Compared to the previous assessment, the tumor is significantly larger and the growth is not only limited to the vocal fold, but also extends in the direction of the morgue sinus and is significantly more broad-based in the anterior commissure. The tumor is now resected with the laser at the back of the healthy area. Resection extends cranially to above the left pocket crease, resection is performed at the same height in the anterior commissure. Resection extends to the cartilage due to the significantly enlarged tumor growth. Adjustability of the anterior commissure, with relatively voluminous tumor, significantly more difficult. The tumor is therefore reduced in size and removed using the piecemeal technique. This significantly improves the overview. Resection extends slightly over the commissure to the right side at the very front. Detachment of the tumor. Dissection of the cartilage in the area of the anterior commissure. Destruction of the cartilage is evident here and tumor growth into the cartilage, therefore indication for an external procedure. The patient is repositioned and a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline is injected. A Z-shaped skin incision is then made prelaryngeally, ending in a Kocher collar incision. Dissection to the prelaryngeal muscle. This is split in the middle. A pZZZZcondral flap is dissected from the left over the anterior commissure. The cartilage is not infiltrated or even perforated on the outside. A median thyrotomy is created by cutting out a triangle or box-shaped piece of cartilage to the left. Cartilage is resected from the right paramedian to the left via the possible infiltration zone on the inside. Overview now improved. Mucosal remnants with tumor residues lying in front of the cartilage are also resected. Also soft tissue on the left caudal side in front of the cartilage. Co-resection of the ligamentum conicum. Marginal samples are taken in the area of the anterior commissure caudally from the area of the thyroid membrane, caudally on the left in the subglottic area, thread-marked in the arytenoid area, the soft tissue basally, supraglottically in the middle in the area of the anterior commissure, supraglottically on the left thread-marked as well as in the area of the right pouch ligament and vocal cord on the opposite side. All marginal samples go to the frozen section. Relatively little epithelium in the supraglottic center frozen section, but only slight dysplasia visible here. With a currently comprehensible R0 status, mucosa is again removed from the cranial area to be on the safe side, here already at the lower edge of the petiolus. However, this marginal sample is sent for final assessment. The removed cartilage and the fragmented tumor are also sent for final assessment. This is followed by careful hemostasis. The tracheostoma is created after the thyroid gland has been severed in the isthmus area. This is treated with stitches. Visualization of the trachea. Creation of a broadly pedicled Björk flap in the 2nd/3rd intermediate cartilage. Epithelialization of this. Subsequently, closure of the thyroid cartilage via drilled holes. The perichondrium flap is then placed over the thyrofissure and covers it completely. Fixation with 4-0 Vicryl single button sutures on the soft tissues caudally and on the perichondrium on the opposite side. Cranial suture of the soft tissues also with 4-0 Vicryl single button sutures with 4-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Then suture the infrahyoid musculature above with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Then insertion of a flap. Layered skin closure in the typical manner. After lateral tracheotomy, an 8 mm tracheostomy tube was inserted. The procedure was completed without complications. Overall cT2 laryngeal carcinoma of the left vocal fold, growing into the anterior commissure. Therefore switch from transoral laser resection to frontolateral partial laryngectomy. Overall signs of a relatively fast-growing tumor. Microscopically R0 resection intraoperatively. Postoperative swallowing test, if problems persist insertion of a gastric tube and temporary feeding via this. Then presentation to the voice and speech department to initiate swallowing training as soon as possible. However, the swallowing function should not be impaired by the defect in the larynx area. Wait for the final marginal samples and discuss the further procedure at the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Endoscopic laser resection, Tracheotomy

In addition, the patient has a history of papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid gland on the right with complete thyroidectomy and central neck dissection in 2013 and has noticed a mass under the tongue since <2016>. Mirror findings revealed an exophytic mass on the anterior floor of the mouth on the left side in addition to several leukoplakic changes. There was also an exophytic mass in the piriform sinus on the left side, hence the indication for the above-mentioned procedure. In the tumor conference, the surgical procedure was concluded as the patient was not suitable for primary radiochemotherapy due to renal insufficiency.","Induction of anesthesia and intubation transnasally via the anesthesia colleagues. Then first resection of the carcinoma of the floor of the mouth with the monopolar needle, bipolar forceps and scissors. The specimen is placed on cork, including edge samples for a frozen section. Carcinoma in situ is still visible in 2 places, on the lateral edge of the tongue at the transition to the floor of the mouth and in the middle on the underside of the tongue. On the underside of the tongue, a further 2 x resection is required until the edges of the carcinoma in itu are free. This results in an 8 x 5 cm defect in the floor of the mouth and the underside of the tongue. The ostium of the Wharton's duct on the left side is also covered by the tumor, as is the duct, so that no duct probing could be performed here and the duct and ostium as well as parts of the sublingual gland were resected. The remaining parts of the gland are coagulated in a bipolar fashion and later left open. The right ostium of the Wharton's duct is not affected by the tumor resection. Now turn to the neck. Creation of an apron flap in the usual manner, then parallel neck dissection on the right <CLINICIAN_NAME>, on the left <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Right: visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland, the cervical vascular sheath, hypoglossal nerve, accessorius nerve and vagus nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Then removal of the neck preparations IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Then release of the submandibular gland and evacuation of neck levels Ia and b. Several enlarged lymph nodes are seen in all levels, but none of them are macroscopically suspicious. Left: Visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the digastric muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular muscle. Exposure of the accessorius and hypoglossal nerves. Now exposure and dissection of the internal jugular vein. Clearing out the neck levels I-Va while sparing the plexus branches. Here too, several enlarged lymph nodes, but none of them macroscopically suspicious. Now turn to the larynx. The larynx is released on both sides. To do this, the hyoid bone is removed, releasing the infrahyoid muscles, which are beaten downwards. Then place the oblique laryngeal muscles and release the upper thyroid cartilage horn. Then release the piriform sinus and the thyroid cartilage on both sides. Be more careful on the left side due to possible tumor infiltration through the pharyngeal wall. Then enter with the Kleinsasser tube and inspect the localization of the tumour again. Then incision of the pharynx above the tumor 2 cm safety margin. Opening of the pharynx. This shows that there are 2 separate tumors. One on the lateral pharyngeal wall, which is 1.5 cm in size with a central ulcer, this ulcer runs through the entire pharyngeal wall. Then medially, a superficial tumor affecting the mucosa on the arytenoid cartilage and in the medial area of the piriform sinus. Both tumors are next to each other, but have healthy mucosa in between. However, they are so close together that both are resected in one block. Then marginal samples are taken and the specimen is sent to the pathology department on cork. All margin samples are R0 in the frozen section, without carcinoma in situ. Now perform the laryngectomy. Proceed from caudal to ventral. Deposition of the larynx at the cricoid cartilage, then dissection along the cricoid cartilage and the entire laryngeal skeleton in a cranial direction so that the larynx is completely released with maximum mucosal preservation. Removal of the vocal folds for the research laboratory and sending the laryngeal preparation for pathology. The base of the tongue was then released and the dorso-lateral left myotomy performed. Prior to this, a Provox Vega prosthesis was inserted in the usual manner. Then three-layer pharyngeal suture by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, insertion of 2 Redon drains and return to the mouth. The defect on the underside of the tongue is covered with split skin. The split skin comes from the right thigh. Stitch incisions are made through the split skin and sutures are applied. At the end, a compress is sutured and the entire procedure is completed without complications. Please present the patient to the tumor conference to plan radiotherapy.

CT showed no evidence of infiltration of the thyroid cartilage in the anterior commissure area. Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery was indicated.","First of all, MLE once again: positioning of the tumor. This sits broadly in the area of the anterior vocal fold, sits broadly in the area of the anterior commissure, extends subglottically and extends almost to the middle of the vocal fold on the right, but here superficially. Tumor also extends anteriorly somewhat to the supraglottic and left anterior transition towards the ventriculus laryngis. However, the free mucosal margin is still clearly visible. The next step is laser resection with a 4 watt pulsed laser; the tumor is removed in several fractions. Complete resection of the left vocal fold up to the arytenoid cartilage is performed, including the subglottic slope up to the cricoid cartilage as well as the laryngeal ventricle and parts of the left pouch ligament at the front. The supraglottic area is also resected in the front. Resection extends to the right, here the anterior part of the vocal fold is resected according to the real superficial extent of the tumor. In the anterior area, extending to the right and left, the thyroid cartilage is exposed from the supraglottic area down to the cricoid cartilage. Cartilage areas macroscopically free. Removal of the soft tissue is possible without visible tumor contact. Marginal samples are now taken from the subglottic area, from the cricothyroid membrane area and from the anterior commissure area. A marginal sample is also taken from the entire surface of the right vocal cord. In addition, a left dorsal marginal sample from the arytenoid region, left caudal, left cranial and left basal. In the frozen section, except for the left dorsal margin sample, in which carcinomas are still detectable in situ, all margin samples are healthy. Therefore, the resection in the arytenoid region is now carried out again with the laser, including parts of the anterior arytenoid cartilage. In addition, a strip of mucosa from the entire posterior area is sent in again as a marginal sample for the frozen section. No more infiltrates detectable here. Thus R0 resection status. Careful hemostasis is performed with supratabs and monopolar. No bleeding at the final inspection. Completion of the procedure without complications. Overall extensive laser resection of a cT2 carcinoma. The thyroid cartilage and cricoid cartilage are exposed anteriorly and laterally, more on the left than on the right, as is the cricothyroid membrane. For this reason, the patient was given Sobelin intraoperatively. Antibiotics should be continued for about 1 week. Postoperatively, due to the extent of the tumor and after laser resection, control MLE is essential after 10 to 12 weeks.","Laser resection of laryngeal carcinoma

Then advance the 0 degree optic through the glottic plane into the trachea. Further advancement into the bronchial system on both sides. No special features up to the exit of the segmental bronchi. No special features when reflecting back in the area of the trachea. Now intubation of the patient. First advance the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach. The mucosal conditions in the stomach and esophagus are normal. Now inspect the hypopharynx on both sides and the postcricoid region. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions here. No abnormalities in the oropharyngeal region either. Pulling up of the soft palate, no special features. No pathological mucosal changes in the nasopharyngeal region or in the oral cavity. Now adjustment of the larynx with the medium-sized small bore tube. In the region of the left larynx, starting from the left vocal cord, there is a mass that extends to just in front of the anterior commissure, into the morgue sinus and extends to the left pouch ligament. This mass extends dorsally to the posterior third of the vocal fold. Tissue is removed from this area and sent for frozen section examination. Histology revealed a squamous cell carcinoma. As discussed with the patient preoperatively, laser resection of this process is now performed. Adjustment with the medium-sized small water tube. The tumor can be well exposed. Now resect the tumor, resecting the vocal fold on the left side from the arytenoid cartilage to the anterior commissure and then resecting the pouch ligament and the morgue sinus upwards. The tip of the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage and the thyroid cartilage are exposed. Bleeding is stopped with monopolar coagulation. As far as can be assessed intraoperatively, the resection is successful in sano. Several marginal samples are taken. Careful hemostasis. Difficult preparation conditions due to often somewhat difficult exposure. Now completion of the procedure. All examinations and manipulations with the aid of the endoscope or microscope.

In the tumor follow-up, CT imaging reveals a flat contrast agent image on the left edge of the tongue. The patient suffers from postradiogenic esophageal stenosis and laryngeal stenosis and is permanently tracheostomized. Based on the findings, the above-mentioned operation is indicated. Preoperatively, a sample was taken from the suspected tumor area on the left edge of the tongue. This revealed a squamous cell carcinoma.","Transferring the patient to the operating theater. Carrying out the team time-out with the anesthesia colleagues and induction of intubation anesthesia by the colleagues. Induction of anesthesia through the existing tracheostoma. Now attempt panendoscopy. The patient is extremely difficult to view with the small bore tube due to the severe postradiogenic changes. No abnormalities in the hypopharynx and supraglottic larynx as far as can be assessed. The glottis cannot be adequately assessed, nor can the esophageal opening. A flexible gastroesophagoscopy is not performed as the mucosa is very vulnerable to contact and the lumen is very narrow. Closer inspection with the small flexible scope reveals an almost obliterated esophageal lumen. The placement of a nasogastric tube is also frustrating after several attempts. The tumor is now resected at the edge of the tongue on the left side with a safety margin of approx. 1 cm. Removal of the specimen under constant blood control using bipolar coagulation forceps and palpatory control. Now mark the suture and send the specimen for frozen section examination. After receipt of the frozen section findings, it is found that there is still carcinoma forming the margin in the specimen in the area of the posterior and medial margin (up to the central specimen). The decision is now made to perform a resection. The resection is performed from posterior to mid-medial and the specimen is again sent in thread-marked for histological frozen section examination. The 2nd frozen section is now reliably tumor-free. In summary, an R0 resection can therefore be assumed. Subtle hemostasis using bipolar coagulation forceps and completion of the procedure without complications. Finally, inspection of the fistula at the upper lateral edge of the tracheostoma on the left side. This shows a fistula channel approx. 2-3 mm wide, which is sharpened with the curette after obtaining a sample biopsy and a granulation-promoting dressing material is inserted.

Dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue and dissection of the apron flap. Expose the submandibular gland on both sides. Now start with the neck dissection on the left side. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle. A soft tissue metastasis is revealed, which can also be histologically confirmed by frozen section. Careful dissection of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Locate the internal jugular vein and follow it. Dissection in level IV. As the vein runs through the large lymph node metastasis, the decision is made to ligate or puncture the vein caudally. This is done without any problems. Now successive further dissection of the metastasis bundle from the sternocleidomastoid. This is done sharply and parts of the muscle are removed. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. This can be preserved and is followed cranially. Sharp dissection of the metastatic bundle of the accessory and common carotid arteries and of the bifurcation. This is successful without any problems and both structures can be preserved. The metastatic bundle can be removed. Removal of the medial and lateral neck preparation. The vagus nerve as well as the hypoglossal nerve can be spared without any problems. Dissection of the lateral neck preparation on the left side reveals cerebrospinal fluid flow in the form of a chyle fistula. However, this stops after suturing. Transition to the right side. Here too, expose the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissect caudally. Trace the omohyoid muscle to the digastric muscle. Exposure of the submandibularis in its entirety on the right side and exposure of the digaster muscle and dissection of the internal jugular vein. The internal jugular vein and all its branches can be preserved. The common carotid artery and the vagus nerve can also be spared. Suspicious lymph nodes are also found in regions Ib and II. These are successively dissected. Exposure of the accessory nerve and preservation of the same. Successive removal of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the plexus branches. Dissection of the medial neck preparation and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve. As on the left side, there is no evidence of increased bleeding. L Proceed to laryngectomy. Free preparation of the larynx medial to the cervical vascular sheath on both sides. Dissection of the prelaryngeal musculature and folding it down. Dissecting the cornu majus of the thyroid cartilage and exposing it. Incision with the scalpel and removal of the mucosa from the thyroid cartilage with the Freer. An attempt is made to preserve as much mucosa as possible on the piriform sinus on the right side. Enter enorally with the TE retractor and transcervically into the pharyngeal tube. Expose the epiglottis and pull up the epiglottis with the triangular clamp. Successive dissection of the pharynx and larynx in order to be able to remove the entire tumor. This extends further cranially than expected. This is successful without any problems. Removal of the trachea in the usual manner. Assessment of the remaining pharyngeal tube. The decision is made to perform a primary closure. Removal of marginal samples and hemostasis. Closure of the pharynx in the usual T-shape. Successive placement of the mucosal sutures after releasing the pharyngeal tube from the base of the tongue to enable tension-free suturing. Multi-layer closure of the pharynx. Stitching over the pharyngeal tube with the dissected prelaryngeal musculature. Suturing in TachoSil. There is now no evidence of increased bleeding, chyle flow or salivation. For this reason, two Redon drains are inserted, one on each side, and the neck is closed in two layers. Sewing in the tracheostoma. Application of a pressure bandage, which should press on the suture site, especially submentally. Antibiotic treatment with 3 g Unacid. After a final consultation with the anesthetist, the operation is completed. Antibiotics should be continued for at least one week. If the pharyngeal tube is thin, Provox has not been used. A P&P presentation should be made at intervals. Presentation of the patient at the tumor conference after receipt of the histology.","Laryngectomy, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy

Due to the poor adjustability, there is now an indication for partial laryngeal resection from the outside. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carry out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Induction of anesthesia and intubation of the patient. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon. Initial re-inspection of the endolarynx. Insertion of the mouth guard. Insertion of the size D small bore tube. With difficulty, the posterior commissure can be adjusted with the small bore tube. The anterior commissure can only be seen with the aid of the fixed telescope. There is a flat change in the right vocal fold, as already described in the previous panendoscopy. Removal of the small water tube and repositioning of the patient in head reclination. Skin spray disinfection and infiltration anesthesia in the area of the planned incision. Skin wipe disinfection and sterile draping. First mark the planned incision from the incisura thyroidea to the cricothyroid ligament. Make the incision using the broken-line technique. Sharp cutting of the cutis and subcutis. Dissection of the platysma and exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Locating the linea alba. Blunt lateralization of the prelaryngeal musculature. Insertion of the retractors. Clear identification of the incisura thyroidea and the ligamentum conicum as well as the level of the cricoid cartilage. Incision of the perichondrium and formation of 2 perichondrium flaps. These are beaten laterally. The laryngeal skeleton is then opened using the wheel. A horizontal incision is also made in the area of the ligamentum conicum. Open the larynx in the median line. You now have a very good overview of the vocal fold on the right side, which has changed over a large area. The extent of the resection is determined with the aid of 0° optics. Endoscopically, the suspicious mucosal change extends into the subglottic slope of the right side. Cranially, the abnormal mucosa extends into the morgue sinus. Maintaining an appropriate safety distance, the entire right vocal fold is now excised, including the vocal ligament and the vocalis muscle. Dorsally, the tumor is deposited on the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage. Suture marking of the main preparation. Removal of marginal samples (right cranial vocal fold, right caudal vocal fold, anterior commissure, margin of the vocal process). Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. During the intraoperative frozen section diagnosis, both the specimen and the margin samples show that clear extensions of a carcinoma in situ are still present on all sides. For this reason, circular resection was initially carried out and new marginal samples were taken. It is now also apparent that there are also clear CIS extensions in the area of the vocal fold on the left front. Therefore, the extent of the resection is extended over the anterior third of the vocal fold on the left to the middle third of the vocal fold up to just before the posterior third of the vocal fold. In the area of the right vocal fold, the entire subglottic slope is resected. The medial mucosa-covered surface is also resected in the area of the right arytenoid. Finally, there are still CIS extensions in the area of the left vocal fold and the right medial arytenoid surface. After further resection, new marginal samples are taken and sent for definitive histological examination. The extent of resection on the right ary extends here to just before the interarytenoid region. A further resection in the same session does not appear to make sense, also in view of the patient's numerous previous illnesses. Therefore, hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Insertion of a 12 mm laryngeal wedge. Prior to this, 4 drill holes were made in the area of the thyroid cartilage. Fixation of the Keel with PDS 4.0, followed by folding back the perichondrium leaves and suturing them over the Keel. Suture the incision in the area of the ligamentum conicum. Mobilization of the lateralized muscle bellies with the prelaryngeal musculature and readaptation in the midline area. Insertion of a sterile flap. Subcutaneous suture with Vicryl 4.0 and skin suture with Ethilon 5.0. Final consultation with the anesthesia colleagues and completion of the operation without complications.","Partial laryngeal resection from the outside

Histologically G3. There is an exophytic superficial mass on the tip of the tongue/edge of the tongue on the right. The ultrasound examination showed a cN0 neck status with a lymph node level Ib on the right that was worth checking. The tumor could not be visualized in the CT scan due to its superficiality and dental artifacts. No lymph node metastases. An unclear multiple sclerosis in the processus spinosus of BWK 1 is described, here DD osteoma, DD osteoplastic metastasis and scintigraphic correlate recommended. Based on the medical history and clinical findings, indication for the above-mentioned procedure. No toxins.","First, transfer the patient to the operating theater. Then active patient identification and team time out as well as consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Then induction of anesthesia and tracheoscopy with the aid of the laryngeal spatula by the surgeon. The glottic plane, vocal folds, subglottic area, entire trachea up to the carina are unremarkable. Now intubation by the anesthetist and deepening of the anesthesia. Then transition to esophagogastroscopy. Careful insertion of the flexible endoscope with the aid of the laryngeal spatula under air insufflation. Pre-viewing into the stomach. Inversion here. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions everywhere. Air desufflation and retraction of the endoscope everywhere. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions in the entire esophagus. Now transition to laryngoscopy/pharyngoscopy: The surgeon positions the head and enters the oropharynx with the Kleinsasser tube type C. The tonsils, base of the tongue, vallecula, aryepiglottic folds on both sides, arytenoid cartilage on both sides, piriform sinus on both sides, interary area, postcricoid area and glottic plane are unremarkable. No evidence of a secondary tumor. Palpation of the tonsils and the base of the tongue, vallecula clear. Inspection of the oral cavity and floor of the mouth. No suspicious mass except for the previously described exophytic, superficially growing mass on the anterior right edge of the tongue with a longitudinal diameter of approx. 1 ˝ cm and a transverse diameter of 1 cm. Growing superficially on palpation. Now insertion of the spandex and rein suture. Insertion in the area of the raphe, thereby dislocating the tongue anteriorly and laterally. Now mark the resection margins with the monopolar with a safety margin of more than 1 cm. Demonstration on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Successive resection of the tumor along the resection margins using bipolar coagulation and pointed scissors. Meticulous hemostasis is performed. The tumor is resected in toto with a sufficient safety margin of more than 1 cm, suture marking short short tongue tip anterior, short long tongue dorsum, long long tongue margin right and wound base. The preparation is sent for final histology. Re-inspection of the surgical site. Repeated bipolar coagulation, also in depth. Absolutely dry wound conditions. No further bleeding. Intraoperative administration of 250 mg SDH, head repositioning by the surgeon and completion of the procedure without complications.

This revealed a cT2 tongue margin carcinoma on the right. Initially, induction chemotherapy was performed, as the patient was very reluctant to undergo surgery. Induction chemotherapy resulted in only minimal tumor reduction macroscopically and no metabolic reduction in the PET-CT. The decision was therefore made to proceed with definitive surgical treatment.","Induction of anesthesia. Intubation by anesthesia colleagues. Sterile washing and draping. Insertion of a covered retractor into the mouth and spandex. Inspection of the tongue. There is an exophytic mass in the area of the right edge of the tongue. The mass is clearly progressive. It spreads far beyond the midline to the left side. The tumor extends palpatorily to the other side, especially in the middle and posterior part of the tongue. Add <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The decision is made to perform the operation by means of complete tumor removal despite the significant progression of the tumor. Incision of the mucosa with the monopolar needle and successive resection of the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1 cm. The ultrasonic knife as well as conventional scissors and bipolar forceps are used for this. Only a narrow strip of mucosa remains in the area of the left base of the tongue. In this area, a complete centimeter safety margin is not possible without removing this remaining strip of mucosa. More tissue remains at the tip of the tongue. During tumor resection, the lingual artery is shown on the left side. It can be clearly seen that this artery also extends into the tumor. Consult <CLINICIAN_NAME> again. It is decided to continue the tumor resection, also removing the lingual artery on the left side. A resection must also be performed for this in order to ultimately achieve an R0 situation in this area as well. In the area of the base of the tongue, a sufficient overview cannot be guaranteed from the transoral approach. Therefore, repositioning for neck dissection. Creation of an apron flap. Neck dissection is performed on the right side, exposing the sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid and digaster muscles and the submandibular gland. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein, the facial vein and the accessorius nerve. Release of the neck preparation IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Separation of the digaster venter posterior muscle. Palpation of the tumor and further tumor resection from transcervical using the pull-through technique. The tumor also involves the hyoid bone and the submandibular gland on the right side. These structures are removed en bloc with the tumor resectate. Removal of marginal samples from the specimen and sending for frozen section. Removal of two additional resected specimens, which may have been resected with a macroscopic margin. All margin samples and all resected specimens are tumor-free in the frozen section. Final R0 situation. Consultation of <CLINICIAN_NAME> and demonstration of findings. Joint planning of defect reconstruction using Remmert flap and radial artery graft. Working in a two-team procedure. <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> perform the neck dissection on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidmastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle, submandibular gland, exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein, the facial vein and the superior thyroid artery. Release of the neck preparation level IIa to Va while protecting the plexus branches. Lifting of the Remmert flap. Exposure of the infrahyal musculature for this purpose. Detachment of the infrahyal musculature and release of the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein. The Remmert flap remains pedicled on the superior thyroid artery and accompanying veins of the facial vein so that it can be loosely turned upwards. Parallel to the neck dissection and elevation of the Remmert flap, elevate the radial artery graft from the left. Mark the graft for this purpose. The graft is 16x9 cm in size. Skin incision and visualization of the brachioradialis muscle. Depiction of the vein star in the elbow. Depiction of a superficial vein. The cephalic vein is shown in the center. Showing the ramus superficialis nervi radialis, which is divided into several branches. Visualization of these branches. Locating and exposing the radial artery. Ligating and bypassing the radial artery. Detachment of the graft from the tendons. Dissection of the pedicle with bipolar coagulation and clipping of the branches up to the elbow. Exposure of the concomitant vein and the venous confluence between the superficial and deep system in the elbow. The concomitant veins are exposed and elevated in a confluence as well as a vein of the superficial system and the confluence marking of the radial artery. Deposition of the graft. Transition to suturing of the graft. Positioning of the flap from cervical to enoral. First fixation of the graft on the remaining tongue remnant. Transition to the neck and closure of the pharyngeal defect by placing sutures. Suturing of the graft enorally on the tongue remnant and the floor of the mouth. The flap must be rotated once to achieve three-dimensional closure of the defect. This is difficult, but is ultimately successful. Dissection at the neck of the superior thyroid artery and conditioning of this and the radial artery. Suturing the anastomosis of the two arteries. This is very problematic as the vascular situation in the neck is critical due to plaques and the blood supply to the graft is initially not fully guaranteed. An anastomosis with a long-term flowing lumen is only possible after the superior thyroid artery has been cut back several times. There is also significant reflux from the veins. Superficial and deep veins are couplerized. Perform the tracheotomy through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> at the same time as lifting the radial artery graft. For this, insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a Björ flap. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis. At the end, creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis in the tracheal region in the upper edge through the apron flap. Insertion of a Redon drain on the left side and a flap on the right side. After completion of the neck suture, it becomes apparent that the anastomosis on the right side is being pushed out by the skin closure. It was therefore decided to open this side again and to adapt it only slightly. Continuous perfusion of the graft is now possible. The patient goes to the IOI intubated and ventilated. Please continue antibiotics with Unacid 3 g 3 times a day and heparin 500 units/hour via a perfusor. Nutrition via the PEG tube already in place for 10 days. Then a clinical swallowing test and possibly an X-ray wide swallow. If swallowing is not possible in the long term and aspiration problems occur, a laryngectomy must be considered in the long term.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage

The preoperative laryngoscopy shows that the tumor extends supraglottically to the right side of the ary, consuming the laryngeal epiglottis and growing endolaryngeally on the opposite side. A PEG tube is now placed in the typical manner. First insertion with the flexible gastroscope through the esophagus into the stomach. Then diaphanoscopy in the area of the stomach on the left in the area of the left costal arch and then percutaneous puncture and then placement of the trocar and a PEG tube is placed via this in a typical manner using the thread pull-through method. A gastric tube is then placed. Now form an apron flap. This is lifted at the level of the hyoid bone and fixed in place. A neck dissection is then performed on the right. Expose the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath (common carotid artery, jugular vein, vagus nerve). Caudal of the neck dissection preparation is now dissected cranially for approx. 2 cm. The accessorius nerve is now exposed cranially. The digastric muscle and the hypoglossal nerve are overlaid by a large metastasis, which is carefully removed from the surrounding connective tissue and the jugular tissue. The hypoglossal nerve is then safely identified. The lateral neck dissection specimen is now developed and removed from cranial to caudal while protecting the cervical nerve plexus as much as possible. Now the medial part of the common carotid artery is exposed and the bifurcation is sought out and the external carotid artery is traced further. Identification of the superior thyroid artery. Clamp it, cut it and then ligate it. The medial neck dissection preparation is now completed. Now move to the opposite side. Perform the left neck dissection. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Caudal exposure of the common carotid artery, the jugular vein and the vagus nerve. The neck dissection specimen is now placed laterally at the level of the omohyoid muscle and developed approx. 2 to 3 cm cranially. The accessorius nerve, the hypoglossal nerve and the digastric muscle are now identified cranially. The lateral neck dissection preparation is now developed from cranial to caudal. The neck dissection is now completed medially and the common carotid artery is shown. The carotid bifurcation is identified. The external carotid artery is further traced with the superior thyroid artery clamped, severed and ligated. The hyoid bone is then sought out and freed from surrounding connective and fatty tissue. The prelaryngeal muscles (sternohyoid and thyrohyoid muscles) are dissected ventrally up to the level of the supraclavicular region. The hyoid bone is then removed in toto. The posterior horn of the thyroid cartilage is then identified. Identification of the vascular nerve bundle (superior laryngeal artery and the vein accompanying the superior laryngeal nerve) are identified on both sides, clamped, severed and ligated. The hypopharynx is then bluntly released from the thyroid cartilage on both sides. The larynx is then mobilized laterally. The tracheotomy is now performed. Identification of the thyroid isthmus. Clamp it and stop it. The trachea is incised transversely at the level of the 3rd/4th tracheal cartilage and the trachea is fixed caudally to the skin. Now enter the pharyngeal tube. Identification of the epiglottis, which is dislocated. This reveals the tumorous infiltration described above. The larynx is now incised along the aryepiglottic fold on the right and left. The two incisions are now joined below the arytenoid region. Now develop the hypopharyngeal tube and tilt the larynx ventrally. The trachea is then cut out cranially in the form of a tongue. Careful hemostasis is then performed. Samples are taken from the edges for frozen section diagnosis (circular incision around the defect and marking of the defect). The frozen section diagnosis does not reveal any evidence of carcinoma infiltration, so that an R0 situation can be assumed in the present case. Placement of TachoComp, followed by suturing of the muscle layer above the pharyngeal tube. The prelaryngeal musculature is readapted. Subsequent careful irrigation of the wound. Placement of Redon drains. Subcutaneous suture. Skin suture. Suturing of the tracheostoma. It is now apparent that there is probably a dermal nevus on the right supraclavicular side, which is incised and sent for histopathological processing. A tracheostomy tube was then placed. The patient is then admitted to the intensive care unit postoperatively. F a c i t : Laryngectomy, neck dissection on both sides for cT3 laryngeal carcinoma on the right.

Performing flexible oesophagoscopy and gastroscopy and inserting a PEG using the thread pull-through method. This can be done without any problems with good diaphanoscopy. Insertion of a covered retractor and looping of the tongue. Inspection of the tumor. A tumor at least 4 cm in size can be seen on the middle third of the tongue margin. The tumor extends to the floor of the mouth, but does not involve the anterior floor of the mouth or the base of the tongue. Incision of the mucosa using a monopolar needle with a safety margin of 1 to 1.5 cm. Removal of the tumor using scissors, bipolar forceps and palpation. The tumor penetrates deep down to the midline of the tongue. The tumor can be removed in its entirety. The tumor preparation is thread-marked in its entirety for frozen section. This is clearly an R0 situation. Due to the large resulting defect, the decision was made to cover the defect with a radialis graft to improve function. Therefore neck dissection on the left side. Neck dissection on the right side is not performed due to the lack of infiltration of the base of the tongue and anterior floor of the mouth and a cN0 neck status on the right side.

According to clinic and imaging, mandible not infiltrated with line in the area of the tongue not crossed.","Transferring the patient to the operating theater. Carrying out the team time-out and preliminary consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. Induction of intubation anesthesia by colleagues. Start of the operation using gastroscopy. Careful pre-scanning with gastroesophagoscope into the stomach. Air insufflation and identification of the anterior wall of the stomach. Perform positive diaphanoscopy and insertion of the PEG tube in the usual manner using the thread pull-through method without complications. Now sterile wiping and draping of the patient. Then pharyngoscopy and inspection of the oral cavity again. The exophytic tumor can be seen in the area of the floor of the mouth and the edge of the tongue. Confirmation that the midline has not been crossed and bone has not been infiltrated or reached. Therefore, confirmation of the surgical indication with flap coverage. This is followed by transoral tumor resection. The tumor is macroscopically incised with a safety margin of at least 1 cm to 1.5 cm and successively removed. The floor of the mouth with external musculature and almost the entire body of the tongue on the left side are removed. The resection extends forward to the alveolar ridge, where the mucosa is pushed away directly from the bone at the level of the alveoli and left together with the periosteum on the tumor. Overall, macroscopically, the tumor is clearly removed in healthy tissue. The tumor is marked using sutures. Send in for frozen section diagnostics. All margins tumor-free in the frozen section. Therefore R0 resection. Subsequent sterile covering of all relevant surgical areas after skin disinfection. Neck dissection on both sides and tracheostoma placement. Tracheostomy: creation of the tracheostoma approx. 0.5 cm below the cricoid cartilage, separation of the cutaneous/subcutaneous tissue. Identification of the infralaryngeal musculature and division of the musculature in the midline. After visualization of the thyroid isthmus, it is dissected after bipolar coagulation. Now locate the tracheal wall and perform the tracheotomy in the 2nd to 3rd intratracheal ring space. Epithelialization of the single button sutures, reintubation to an 8-bore tracheostomy tube. Completion of the tracheostomy without complications. Neck dissection on the right side through <CLINICIAN_NAME>: skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cutting through the cutaneous/subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the platysma and subplatysmal flaps. Dissection. After identification of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, dissection down to the deep cervical fascia. Now identify the digastric and omohyoid muscles and follow the musculature to the hyoid bone. Release the submandibular gland from the capsule. Snare the facial vein and loop upwards to protect the marginal facial ramus. Now expose the vascular cervical nerve sheath and successive removal of the neck preparation after exposing the accessorius nerve from cranial to caudal in the usual manner. All nerve branches of the cervical plexus, the accessorius nerve and the hypoglossal nerve are spared. Now perform the submandibulectomy. Dissection along the gland capsule for this purpose. Ligation of the V. facialis and the A. facialis. Identification of the mylohyoid muscle. Identification of the lingual nerve and sparing of the same. Removal of the wharton's duct and removal of the gland. Neck dissection also performed in the region of regions Ib and Ia without further complications. Primary wound closure using a platysma and cutaneous suture after placement of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Neck dissection on the left (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the accessorius nerve, submandibular gland, hypoglossal nerve and digaster venter anterior and venter posterior. Expose the internal jugular vein and the branches of the cervical plexus and the common carotid artery. The neck preparation is now detached from level II to V b. Punctual hemostasis. Now turn to level I b (level I a has already been removed from the opposite side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>): here the submandibular gland is dissected from the submandibular lobe. As part of the tumor resection, the lingual nerve was removed in advance so that it could no longer be exposed. However, the hypoglossal nerve was spared. The submandibular gland is finally removed after the Wharton's duct is ligated and severed using a clamp. The facial artery can be dissected and used later for the anastomosis. Level I b is now cleared out on the left under sonographic control and to ensure that all sonographically identifiable metastases have actually been removed. This is done with major problems. The tendon of the digaster muscle is now severed in the middle and the opening to the oral cavity is bluntly made using a clamp. The opening is wide enough for 3 fingers and therefore wide enough for the pedicle of the radialis flap, which has been lifted in the meantime by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME> Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (11 x 7 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Defect coverage of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Removal of split skin with the dermatome on the right thigh over the desired flap length. Application of a wound dressing after dermabrasion. Now suturing of the split skin in the area of the forearm in single button sutures. Primary wound closure of the proximal wound in the forearm area. Application of a forearm splint after application of the wound dressing. Now flap suturing (<CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME>): The flap is pulled from cervical to enoral with the clamp and can be easily adapted to the defect using 4.0 Vicryl, as previously drawn in. There is no residual defect, the flap is well adapted on all sides. Handover to <CLINICIAN_NAME> for the anastomosis of the artery. Anastomosis of the superior thyroid artery flap, venous anastomosis using 2 coupler sutures to the superior thyroid stroma. At the end, subtle hemostasis is performed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Subsequent extensive irrigation of the sides of the neck. Hemostasis. Wound closure in layers without insertion of a Redon drain on the right and 2 flaps on the left. This also included epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Subsequent completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for monitoring.

Entry with the small bore tube under dental protection and inspection of the primary tumor region. The oral cavity and oropharynx are unremarkable. Likewise the hypopharynx with inconspicuous postcricoid region and free piriform sinus as well as free esophageal entrance. There is now a tumorous protrusion in the endolaryngeal region, especially on the right anterior side, with a barely adjustable glottic plane. In conjunction with CT imaging, confirmation of the initially described extent and indication for laryngectomy. Placement of a nasogastric feeding tube. Incision and elevation of a broad-based apron flap. This reveals extensive subcutaneous scarring on the right side, with a history of parotidectomy, which extends to the entire neck area. The neck dissection is now initially performed as a revision of the right side. Release of the markedly scarred sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland and exposure of the digastric muscle, which is also scarred. A long scarred cervical vascular sheath can also be seen. Removal of the anterior neck preparation and preservation of the external carotid arteries and the hypoglossal nerve. Initial exposure of the facial vein. This is later removed for tumor resection. Exposure of the upper pole of the thyroid gland on the right side. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein with careful removal of scars. Towards the lateral neck preparation, regular tissue is visible again. Careful exposure of the cervical plexus and clearing to level Va. Significant cranial scarring again. Despite careful visualization and preparation, the accessorius nerve cannot be visualized and was presumably resected during the previous operation. Later, the upper horn of the thyroid cartilage and the hyoid are visualized. Significant scarring here as well, questionable after radiotherapy or more extensive previous surgery than can be determined from the history. Careful lateral release of the thyroid cartilage and release of the piriform sinus. Anterior exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea and lateral dissection of half of the thyroid gland. Turn to the opposite side. No preliminary treatment here. Exposure and preservation of the external vein and auricularis magnus. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle.

Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the V. facialis, A. thyroidea superior, N. hypoglossus and Ansa cervicalis. Tracing of the thyroid vessels and also dissection of the left thyroid lobe. Dissection of the left lobe of the thyroid gland. Dissection of the internal jugular vein after exposure of the accessorius nerve. After free dissection of the cervical vascular sheath, exposing the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve, completion in the direction of level V, with careful protection and preservation of the cervical plexus branches. Finally, in the case of sonographically conspicuous findings, exploration and evacuation of level Ib. To do this, release the submandibular gland. Cranial dissection of the nerve-conducting connective tissue. Careful exploration. Removal of the facial lymph nodes. Careful exploration. There are no suspicious changes here. Lymph nodes are also found dorsally and anteriorly to the gland. No further measures after final palpation. Finally, if the wound is dry, expose the thyroid cartilage horn on the left side. Finally, removal of the upper laryngeal bundle. Release of the piriform sinus and now detachment of the infrahyoid musculature. Here, the larynx appears to be coarsely widened, especially on the right side, and when the infrahyoid muscles are lifted, they are compressed and there is a questionable tumor breakthrough. It was therefore decided to leave the infrahyoid muscles completely on the laryngeal skeleton. Even if the relationship between the thyroid and hyoid is unclear, the hyoid should be removed and the soft tissue detached en bloc. Enter the pharynx in the area of the vallecula. Exposure of the epiglottis. Extension of the resection to protect the mucosa. As described above, there is no growth extending beyond the larynx in the area of the mucosal level. Careful release of the piriform sinus. Postcricoid release. Now a good overview of the tumor, which extends in the area of the larynx, especially on the right side, towards the thyroid cartilage, partly also towards the pre-epiglottic space and here, at least palpatorily, there is a suspicion of a thyroid cartilage rupture. Entry into the trachea and intubation. Removal of the first tracheal ring, creating a dorsally elevated trachea. The preparation now shows wide resection margins in relation to the mucosal level, with only a narrow area in the region of the raised infrahyoid musculature when the trachea breaks through. Therefore, an edge sample is taken at the situs, at the closest distance to the infrahyoid musculature left here. The frozen section shows this to be tumor-free, so that an R0 situation can be assumed here. A size 10 Provox prosthesis is now placed, with cranial puncture of the trachea and placement of the Provox voice prosthesis using the usual pull-through method. Finally, good positioning. Sparing right lateral myotomy in otherwise wide conditions and already visible reflux. No further measures in the area of the upper esophageal sphincter. Separation of the sternal insertions of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and subsequent careful two-layer pharyngeal closure. Careful wound inspection. If the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Careful two-layer wound closure with incision of the tracheostoma. Subsequent reintubation to a size 10 low-cuff cannula. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT4a transglottic laryngeal carcinoma with right emphasis. Please continue antibiotics for 24 hours with Unacid 3 g. Perform an X-ray pre-swallow on the 8th to 10th postoperative day. Please present at our interdisciplinary tumor conference. Determination of any pre-irradiation carried out in the case of conspicuously extensive scarring on the right cervical side.","Laryngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Provox Voice Prosthesis

Removal of representative marginal samples. These are sent in for a frozen section and are found intraoperatively in such a way that the tumor border to the healthy tissue is less than 1 mm in the right side. Therefore, in the case of close in sano resection, a further resection is performed in the area of the right settling area in the area of the pocket crease as well as dorsally and also on the dorsal left side. These marginal samples are sent in again for frozen section and are still assessed intraoperatively as all tumor-free. Subtle hemostasis. Removal of the bulb. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection on both sides: start with the neck dissection on the right side. If a lymph node metastasis has been removed, slight scarring here, therefore more difficult preparation conditions. Carry out neck dissection levels I b to V. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and the accessorius, vagus and hypoglossal nerves. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve, vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. The resection is performed while preserving all branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery. In the area of the venous angle, where the metastasis had initially been removed in a first procedure, further lymph node conglomerates are visible. Enlarged lymph nodes can also be seen in levels II and III. All levels are completely removed. Subsequent subtle hemostasis. Insertion of a Redon drain. Multi-layer wound closure. Transition to the left side. Identical procedure here. Here, too, long exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the vagus nerve, accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis.

Inspection of the hypopharynx on the left side with the size C small bore tube. The tumor described above is unchanged in size, which predominantly extends to the lateral wall of the hypopharynx and slightly to the piriform sinus wall. Otherwise there is no tumor. The medial piriform sinus wall is certainly not affected by the tumor. Removal of all instruments. Repositioning of the patient for tumor resection. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Incision with cutting around a platysmal flap. Dissection of the platysma and the platysmal flap. A large lymph node conglomerate can be seen laterally and on the vein, which extends to the vein angle. This is dissected down from the vein. The cranial part shows that the vein is clearly infiltrated by the tumor, which is why the decision is made to resect the vein. Therefore, long dissection of the vagus nerve and the carotid artery. Exposure of the internal jugular vein at the base of the skull. Ligation of the internal jugular vein at the base of the skull and detachment of the vein. This also releases the large lymph node conglomerate. Subsequent removal of levels I b, II, III, IV and V. It can also be seen that the caudal part of the accessorius nerve is infiltrated by lymph node metastases as it passes through to the trapezius muscle. Resection of the nerve here as well. The nerve is preserved in the cranial part in the innervation area of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Long-term dissection of the nerve here. Displacement and re-embedding at the end of the operation in the sense of neurolysis. Preservation of the plexus branches during dissection. Release of the larynx. Release of the pharynx. Resection of the lateral part of the thyroid cartilage. This provides a good view of the pharynx. Separation of the constrictor pharyngis. Opening of the pharynx lateral and caudal to the tumor. From here, under good visibility, cut around the tumor with a macroscopically sufficient safety margin. Remove frozen sections after assessing the specimen. These are still declared tumor-free intraoperatively. Therefore pharyngeal suture with single button sutures. Closure of the constrictor pharyngeal muscle with continuous sutures. As the pharynx could be closed with local mucosa without tension, suturing of the platysmal flap was not necessary. Repositioning of the platysmal flap. Multi-layer wound closure. Insertion of a Redon drain. Application of a pressure dressing. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Completion of the procedure. Note: PEG placement may need to be discussed with the patient.

Furthermore, there is a post-operative laser resection of a carcinoma in situ of the left arytenoid region with neck dissection in 2006, which is why the above-mentioned procedure is indicated.","Initially beginning with a pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy. An exophytic mass is seen, starting at the pharyngo-epiglottic fold, which extends to the left arytenoid, infiltrates the entrance of the left piriform sinus and extends to the opposite side in the postcricoid region. Now imaging with narrow-band imaging and confirmation that laser resection is not possible here, even after consulting the CT findings. Then enter with the flexible oesophagoscope and pre-scan into the stomach. Here, conditions were unremarkable on all sides. Now perform the PEG insertion using the thread pull-through method with good diaphanoscopy. Then sterile washing and draping. Create an apron flap in the usual manner. Start with neck dissection on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle of the submandibular gland. Then clearing of the neck levels IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches and sparing the hypoglossal nerve and the accessorius nerve. Unfortunately, the lingual artery and the superior thyroid artery must be removed. Level IV shows a high-lying thoracic duct. This is partially injured during neck level removal and chyle flow occurs. In this case, the duct with the vein opening is cut off and covered with Tachosil. This is performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Then turn to the opposite side and neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Clearing of the neck level while sparing the plexus branches of the hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. The cervical vascular sheath was exposed and spared on both sides. The lingual artery can remain on the right side, but unfortunately the right superior thyroid artery must also be removed. The facial artery and ascending pharyngeal artery are still present on both sides and would theoretically still be available for a free flap transplant. Now release the hyoid bone and release the larynx by detaching the cervical vascular sheath and the thyroid gland from the larynx. Separation of the infrahyoid muscles and entry into the pharynx from the right side. Disluxation of the epiglottis and inspection of the tumor, which is as described above. Mucosal changes extend along the left hypopharyngeal side wall into the base of the tongue. Now incision of the mucosa at the edge of the epiglottis up to the postcricoid region and removal of the larynx, taking a large part of the pharynx on the left side with it. Initially, only a very narrow mucosal strip of the posterior wall of the hypopharynx remains. The esophageal opening itself is free and does not need to be resected. Marginal samples are taken. Here, extensive carcinoma in situ with partial transition to a microinvasive carcinoma can still be seen, particularly in the area of the left hypopharynx. Therefore, a resection must be performed here. Due to the resection, a complete pharyngectomy is performed in the caudal region. Extensive carcinoma in situ with partial microinvasion in the resected area. Therefore, further resection so that only a small amount of mucosa remains in the cranial and middle area of the hypopharynx and a transplant must be inserted in any case. After consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the decision is made to use a pectoralis major graft. A pro vox prosthesis is not inserted, even after consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, as the pharyngeal reconstruction must be carried out completely with the pectoralis graft and there is no longer any mucous membrane capable of vibrating. Now lift the pectoralis major graft. To do this, measure the defect and lift and mark the graft 10 x 12 cm. A bridge is constructed in the area of the deltopectoral flap. The pectoralis major graft is lifted from the thoracic wall. Holding sutures are inserted and the graft is released, leaving the pedicle in place, and pulled upwards under the bridge. Mucosal sutures are then placed in the area of the esophageal inlet and also in the area of the base of the tongue and the cranial hypopharyngeal descending edge. The graft is then pulled in secondarily over the inserted sutures and knotted in place. The remaining parts of the remaining mucosa are connected to the graft to create a neopharynx through a tubed pectoralis major flap. A nasogastric tube was previously inserted for splinting. The stalk of the pectoralis major flap is positioned exactly on the chyle fistula so that it is also covered. Insertion of 3 redone drains in the thoracic region and one redone drain in each neck region. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue postoperative antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Please provide fat-free nutrition with periamine for 3 days. Due to the size of the defect and the very large graft incision, there is a high risk of fistula, also because the pectoralis major flap is very large and has the lowest blood supply in the cranial area. If there is a risk of fistula, please open the neck and irrigate at an early stage. Otherwise, if there is no risk of fistula, take an X-ray vomit on the 12th postoperative day and carefully build up a diet. The patient must be presented to the tumor conference for planning of postoperative radiochemotherapy.","Laryngectomy, Caudal pharyngectomy, Modified radical neck dissection, Permanent tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Pedicled flap (Pectoralis major)

Sonography revealed a fluid-filled cystic mass with suspicious sonomorphology. Therefore, <2017> an unremarkable panendoscopy and a lymph node extirpation in level II on the left was performed. Histologically, this revealed a p16 positive lymph node metastasis of a squamous cell carcinoma, and the subsequent PET-CT showed a suspicious accumulation of contrast medium in the area of the left tonsil. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about this before the operation.","Initial head positioning by the surgeon. Insertion of the McIVOR oral spatula and adjustment of the left tonsil tube. Macroscopically inconspicuous .............. Tonsil, in particular no evidence of growth of the suspected carcinoma beyond the tonsil on inspection. Marking of the resection margins in the area of the anterior and posterior palatal arch using a monopolar needle. Tumor tonsillectomy is then performed using the dissection technique, including a muscle margin of the palatoglossal arch and parts of the anterior and posterior palatal arch and the base of the tongue in the area of the lower pole. The tonsil is extirpated in toto and sent to the frozen section marked with a suture. The diagnosis of a squamous cell carcinoma resected in sano, but only just R0 towards the base of the wound. In the meantime, head repositioning for neck dissection on the left. After lymph node extirpation in level II on the left, approx. 1.5 transverse fingers wide and thus relatively far superior, a horizontal scar is seen. An attempt is initially made to integrate this into the course of the neck dissection, but this is too close to the lower jaw and would also result in a cosmetically unfavorable, very anterior course of the further incision. It was therefore decided to make a new incision in this area, far posterior to the posterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Injection of a total of 8 ml xylocaine with added adrenaline. Skin disinfection and sterile draping. Skin incision down to the platysma. Exposure and ligation of the external jugular vein. Subsequent dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve. Caudal dissection and exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Superiorly, the digaster muscle is exposed through the scar tissue and dissected about halfway anteriorly. Condition after previous operation, difficult conditions. Now dissect the vascular nerve sheath. The neck dissect is dissected in one piece up to level IIa, set down cranially in level IIa, cut caudally under the accessorius nerve. The cervical anus is then located and dissected from inferior to superior and laterally, with successive clean dissection of the neck dissectate from the scalene musculature while protecting the anus. This is successful without any problems. Now caudally, at the end of level IV, separation of the neck dissectate after bipolar coagulation and ligation. Now, after anterior dissection of the outlet of the facial vein and the angle between the facial vein and the internal jugular vein. Dissection of a further lymph node and a small amount of fatty tissue. Subsequent wound irrigation and meticulous hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. There is no evidence of residual fatty tissue or lymphatic tissue in the surgical area. Therefore, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and two-layer wound closure in the typical manner. Head repositioning in the reclination position and insertion of the McIVOR oral spatula. Adjustment of the left tonsil lodge and removal of a total of five marginal samples, which are sent for frozen section. Minute hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. By <CLINICIAN_NAME>, prophylactic caudal and lateral repositioning in the tonsil bed. All marginal samples were found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleagues. Thus repeated inspection. Dry conditions. Removal of the inserted ball swab. Insertion of a nasogastric feeding tube, under visualization in the typical manner.

Now tongue base carcinoma, histologically squamous cell carcinoma on the left, extending to the midline. Second tumor after radiotherapy in childhood. Therefore above mentioned surgery indicated.","First, pharyngoscopy/laryngoscopy again and confirmation of the extent. The tumor is located in the base of the tongue on the left, reaching at least to the midline. The tumor extends to the glossotonsillar groove or the tonsil. This confirms the indication for surgery with flap coverage. First PEG placement: insertion of the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach. There, after creating the diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm stomach wall tube without complications. Sterile dressing. Subsequent repositioning for tumor resection and flap covering: First skin disinfection and injection of a total of 15 ml Ultracaine with adrenaline into the area of the planned apron flap and sterile covering of all surgical areas. Start with dissection of the apron flap: This is performed via the typical skin incision and by elevating the tissue subplatysmal to the level of the hyoid bone or submandibular gland. Subsequent neck dissection on the left: Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, digastric muscle and omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the infrahyoid muscles. Depiction of the common, internal and external carotid artery, internal jugular vein and facial vein. An external jugular vein is only very thin and is coagulated. The auricular nerve is exposed and preserved. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, cervical nerve and accessorius nerve. Clearing level II to V a, with preservation of the cervical plexus. Subsequent combined tumor resection: start transorally. Tumor is palpated. Cut around the tumor with a distance of at least 1.5 cm on all sides. Resection extends beyond the midline. Resection includes the floor of the mouth, the lingual nerve is initially exposed, but must be resected later due to its proximity to the tumor. Mucosa is resected up to the alveolar ridge along the glossoalveolar groove. Lower parts of the tonsil are resected together with parts of the caudal palatal arch. Counter-operation from the transcervical side to resect the tumor in the base of the tongue while sparing the lingualis on the opposite side. Resection is performed with exposure of the lingual artery on the right side. Resection is performed in the vallecula to the left, taking the mucosa of the lingual epiglottis with it. Resection extends to the piriform sinus entrance. Cranially again up to the lower part of the palatal arch. The specimen is removed and thread-marked. An additional marginal sample is taken from the glossotonsillar groove from the floor of the mouth to the alveolar ridge to the lower edge of the tonsil. This is also thread-marked for the frozen section. In the frozen section, the tumor is basically removed on all sides in healthy tissue, but slightly higher-grade, approximately medium-grade dysplasia caudally in the direction of the vallecula, higher-grade dysplasia cannot be ruled out with certainty. Therefore resection is recommended again. An approx. 1 cm wide strip is resected, including the lateral parts of the epiglottis, the entrance of the piriform sinus up to the posterior pharyngeal wall. This goes to the frozen section marked with a thread remote from the tumor. Confirmation that this marginal sample is tumor-free at the markings remote from the tumor. Thus overall R0 resection with regard to the primary. There is now a defect in the area of the vallecula and pharyngeal side wall up to the tonsil lobe as well as in the floor of the mouth and in particular in the body and base of the tongue. Radial flap is planned after measuring the required three-dimensional dimensions. Neck dissection on the right: This neck dissection is performed in the same way as on the left side. Here too, clearing of levels II to V a. Then tracheotomy: After cutting through the thyroid isthmus and supplying it with puncture ligatures, visualization of the trachea. Entry into the trachea and creation of a broadly pedicled, visor-like, modified Björk flap. This is initially epithelized caudally. Insertion of a laryngectomy tube. Now remove the radial flap from the left forearm: mark the flap in the required three-dimensional size. Maximum length 11 cm, maximum width 7 ˝ cm. First cut around the flap ulnarly and lift subfascially. Then extend the incision into the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the superficial venous system. Only obliterated residual veins are visible here, with an insignificant volume, but still connected to the deep venous system. Visualization of the vascular pedicle. This shows a larger radial vein after confluence. Now first elevation of the superficial venous system from subfascial. Dissection of the radialis flap now from the radial side and elevation from the radial side. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. Caudal exposure of the radial artery. After clamping and sufficient waiting time, always 100% saturation. Deposition of the radial artery. The artery is treated with 4-0 Prolene stitches. Lift the radial artery flap with the pedicle subfascially along the course of the pedicle. Outgoing, smaller vessels are clipped or treated with bipolar coagulation. In the antecubital fossa, the relatively small radial artery is exposed as far as the entrance to the brachial artery. The confluence can be followed a little further into the antecubital fossa. The flap is then removed. The small, rudimentary cephalic veins are also removed and ligated proximally. The relatively thin radial artery is supplied twice using a clip. The confluent radial vein is ligated after removal. Flush the flap with heparin solution. Subsequent insertion of the flap. This is generally very difficult due to the very narrow mouth opening. The flap is successively worked into the defect with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures according to the preforming. Difficult suturing due to the limited space available. Finally, the flap is sutured in all dimensions sufficiently. Tension-free, complete closure. The stalk is carried forward into the left side of the neck. The connecting vessels are then shown here. The superior artery and the facial vein are selected first. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery and the radial artery. Suture with 9-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, initially very good blood flow and good venous return. Insufficient pulsation in the course, possible vascular spasm or thrombosis. Therefore opening of the superior thyroid artery. No blood flow recognizable here, even after dilatation. Either spasm or thrombosis near the outlet. Closure of the superior thyroid artery with clips, as was previously done in the distal area of this artery. Additional ligation. Subsequent exploration of the linguofacial trunk. The facial artery, which was previously preserved, is already thrombosed. Overall, the relatively poor vascular status after chemotherapy was confirmed. The lingual artery can be visualized, the ligature is removed and the artery is shortened. Afterwards, there is good blood flow from this artery. Therefore, the radial artery is now reapproximated to the lingual artery. This is done with 9-0 Ethilon single button sutures. Again, good arterial flow and also good venous return. Therefore, the veins are now conditioned. The facial vein is conditioned with confluence of the radial vein. Selection of a coupler size 2.5 and anastomosis of the veins without any problems. Good venous return. Subsequent irrigation of the entire wound area. Careful hemostasis. Successive wound closure with insertion of a flap on the left and a Redon drainage on the right and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Suture marking in the area of the vascular pedicle for sonographic Doppler control. The flap is then checked again. This shows that there is no blood flow after the puncture. This means that there is again insufficient perfusion via the arterial vessel. The wound must therefore be reopened on the left side. Visualization of the pedicle. Here, too, there is no longer any continuous pulsation, which means that there is another thrombosis. Opening of the artery. No sufficient blood flow recognizable here, similar to the superior thyroid artery previously. Thus, again suspected thrombosis or vasospasm. Even after dilatation, there is no longer sufficient blood flow from this vessel. The flap is flushed with heparin solution until it comes out of the venous vascular system and is recognizable again. Shortening of the vessel in the area of the linguofacial trunk. Very good blood flow here again. The radial artery is dissected like a fish mouth and anastomosed again with the now significantly larger lumen using 9-0 Ethilon single button sutures. Again, after opening the clamp, good blood flow, good venous return. Now follow the perfusion for approx. 1 hour. Here finally permanent arterial pulsation, which also provides signals with the Doppler, in contrast to the previous anastomoses. Puncture of the flap shows good perfusion. This time the anastomosis appears to remain permanently open. Therefore, wound irrigation, careful hemostasis and closure, with insertion of a new flap on the left side. Suturing of the cannula. Flap check again after skin closure. Now good blood circulation. Insertion of a 7 mm tracheostomy tube. The forearm was closed with a split-thickness skin graft taken from the right thigh. A 0.7 mm thick split-thickness skin graft was first removed from the right thigh. Hydrogel or hydrocholoid dressing is then applied here. The arm is then primarily closed in the proximal area and the split skin is successively incorporated into the defect in the area of the forearm. Care is taken to protect the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve of the median nerve and also to protect the ulnar artery. Octenidine-Mepilex dressing is then applied. Loose compresses are placed over this and fixed in place with absorbent cotton. Application or adjustment of a Cramer splint and fixation with a bandage. Positioning of the arm. Arm always well perfused with 100% saturation until the end of the procedure. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Heparin perfusor 500 units/hour must be continued postoperatively. Additionally aspirin 50 mg i.v., please repeat this the next day. Flap check every ˝ hour for the first 1 to 2 days, then according to the schedule for a total of 5 days. Antibiotics given intraoperatively should be continued for 1 week with Unacid. Nutrition via the inserted PEG tube. On the 12th day, approx. gruel swallow and then, depending on the gruel swallow or swallowing function, diet build-up or initiation of swallowing rehabilitation. Overall, in the case of radiochemotherapy for rhabdomyosarcoma, difficult situation with regard to the arterial anastomosis. Overall tongue base tumor cT2 to 3, defect coverage by radial flap. Please present at the interdisciplinary tumor conference after receiving the final histology.","Laryngectomy, Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

There is no macroscopic evidence of a tumor, so several tissue samples are taken. From these, the PE from the piriform sinus is found to be infiltrated by tumor. Start of surgery after appropriate preparation. After sharp transection of the cutis, the subcutaneous cutis and the platysma as well as the subcutaneous fatty tissue and the platysma, the large metastasis is exposed. Exposure of the vascular nerve sheath caudally and ligation of the internal jugular vein. Dissection of the sternocleidomstoideus muscle caudally. Expose the digastric muscle starting at the posterior abdomen. From there, follow ventrally to the omohyodeus muscle. Locate and ligate the internal jugular vein cranially under the digastric muscle. Then dissect the common carotid artery starting from caudal to cranial. Contrary to the radiological report, the carotid artery is not infiltrated. Therefore, the bifurcation together with the internal and external carotid artery can be dissected away from the metastasis in a healthy layer. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve on the left side until the end. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is then removed together with the cranial accessorius nerve. The metastasis is then mobilized laterally, including resection of the cervical plexus and parts of the underlying musculature. The phrenic nerve is exposed and spared until the end. However, the vagus nerve runs through the metastasis and is separated from it caudally and cranially. The large metastasis is then resected with the surrounding fatty tissue in the form of a radical neck dissection. Metastases extend caudally to the clavicle. It is assumed that the thoracic duct is also injured here. The surrounding connective tissue is therefore grasped and ligated. In addition, the caudal stump of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is further exposed and sutured onto the suspected defect site. The upper horn of the thyroid cartilage and the lateral part of the hyoid bone are then exposed. Complete mobilization of the hypoglossal nerve, which is turned upwards. Separation of the digastric muscle. Exposing the hypopharyngeal side wall and performing the lateral pharyngotomy. Enter the pharynx at approximately the level of the upper edge of the epiglottis. From there, the tumor is explored in the direction of the piriform sinus. This is about the size of a pea and is hard to the touch. Triggering of the piriform sinus so that the tumor can be successively excised under vision. The resection covers the entire piriform sinus on the left side and extends to the arytenoid cartilage on the left side. The specimen is then mounted on a cork plate with corresponding markings. The frozen section histology shows that there is still some CIS in the area of the medial margin, i.e. towards the posterior wall of the hypopharynx. Therefore, a resection is performed at this site and another frozen section is made at the margin, which then proves to be free of tumor and CIS. The defect measures approximately 5 1/2 x 5 cm, so that the corresponding radial lobe of <CLINICIAN_NAME> is elevated. Elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left (<CLINICIAN_NAME>/PJ): Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (6 x 4 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Defect coverage of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of graft elevation without complications. PEG placement (<CLINICIAN_NAME>/<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Entering with the gastroesophagoscope under air insufflation, pre-scanning into the stomach. After spontaneous diaphanoscopy, insertion of a PEG in the typical manner using the thread pull-through method. Neck dissection is then performed on the right side. All non-lymphatic structures in regions II to V are removed while sparing them. The facial artery is then traced up to the lower jaw and deposited there so that it can be used for subsequent anastomosis. A breakthrough is then created via the supralaryngeal muscles to the opposite side for insertion of the flap pedicle. After lifting the radial flap, it is sutured into the hypopharyngeal defect. The pedicle is then passed over the entire transition to the opposite side and arterially connected to the facial artery there. The venous anastomosis is made with 2 veins to the internal jugular vein. The lifting defect is then treated with split skin from the right thigh of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequently reintubation onto an 8 . cannula. Complete wound closure after insertion of Redon drains and 2 drainage flaps in the neck. End of the operation, transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Resection of a small piriform sinus carcinoma on the left side via lateral pharyngectomy with a large metastasis on the left side. Contrary to the radiological findings, the common carotid artery was not infiltrated by the tumor. Radical neck dissection on the left side and selective neck dissection on the right side. Defect coverage with radial lobe graft from the left forearm. Due to the extensive metastasis, adjuvant radiochemotherapy is recommended.","TU resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy, PEG placement

Adjustment of the endolaryngeal findings. This revealed a pronounced exophytic mass starting from the area of the vocal process of the left arytenoid cartilage, growing anteriorly into the anterior commissure, growing laterally into the pocket fold, thus T2 glottic laryngeal carcinoma. With good adjustability, decision to attempt transoral laser resection. Setting the laser beam to continuous mode 6 watts. The laser moves around the mass. It is then possible to remove the mass macroscopically in toto using the piecemeal technique. Three marginal samples are then taken (supraglottis, anterior commissure, vocal process). All three marginal samples were found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleague <CLINICIAN_NAME>. An R0 resection can therefore be assumed. Repeated inspection. Hemostasis using monopolar coagulation and swabs soaked in suprarenin. Dry conditions. Removal of the Kleinsasser tube. Completion of the procedure without complications.

No malignancy could be detected in the sample taken. Due to the clinically and radiologically clearly malignant tumor formation, indication for resection with partial pharyngectomy and laryngectomy. Sonographic cN2c neck status without infiltration of neck structures,","Initially bronchoscopic intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. This is initially much more difficult in the case of massive tumor formation in the epiglottis area. The patient is then positioned by the surgeon. Entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the inconspicuous oral cavity. Inconspicuous tonsils and posterior pharyngeal wall. The base of the tongue itself is also inconspicuous, but there is a submucosal tumor formation directly in the vallecula, and the epiglottis is massively distended and depleted. As described above, the tumor extends on the right side over the aryepiglottic fold up to the arya. The aryepiglottic fold is reached on the left side. The tumor formation breaks through the epiglottis towards the supraglottis. As far as can be assessed, the glottic plane itself is free. Certainly no growth towards the subglottic. Several sufficient samples are now taken in the sense of a circumscribed tumor debulking. These are sent for frozen section diagnostics. This shows a poorly differentiated carcinoma, which, however, most likely corresponds to an adeno- or adenoid cystic carcinoma. After discussing the case with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, either a primary adenoid cystic carcinoma or a metastasis can be considered. Therefore, case discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Another review of the CT/thorax. Here, as described above, no suspicious changes. Due to the extensive, massive clinical findings, confirmation of the indication for tumor resection with laryngectomy in the case of both differential diagnoses. Then repositioning. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. Skin incision in the sense of a modified Gluck Sorensen. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap on both sides. Antero-completion of the platysmal flap. Creation of the apron flap. Suture of the apron flap upwards. An external jugular vein is only present and preserved on the right side, as is the auricular nerve on both sides. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Initially starting with the left side: free dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle already reveals a clinically clear lymph node metastasis in level III, contact of the muscle, but with clear connective tissue separation, so that the muscle is preserved here. Visualization of the omohyoid muscle, visualization of the submandibular gland. This is somewhat coarsely altered, but without any suspicious changes. Visualization of the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation while carefully protecting the superior thyroid artery. Due to the location of the metastasis, the facial vein must be ligated and removed. Now free dissection of the internal jugular vein. Throughout the course of both neck dissections, there are clearly vulnerable vessels. Vessels have to be ligated several times. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Repeated hemostasis, but overall continuity-preserving exposure, exposure and exposure of the common carotid artery, exposure of the bulb, exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve. Several, not necessarily suspicious lymph nodes in the area of the jugulo-facial angle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Release of the accessorius triangle. Finally, release of level V with visualization and preservation of the vagus nerve and caudal phrenic nerve. Exposure and selective coagulation of the thoracic duct. Finally, absolutely dry conditions here. Final wound inspection and with dry and cleared conditions, detachment of the infrahyoid musculature on the left side. Skeletonize the left side of the larynx. Exposure of the hyoid. Exposure of the posterior horn of the thyroid gland and selective ligation of the laryngeal bundle. Now turn to the opposite side. In principle the same procedure here. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Here, too, a metastasis-specific mass in level III, located on the internal jugular vein, can be seen at exactly the same location as on the opposite side. The muscle can be separated from this. Cranially in level II a clinically clear lymph node metastasis measuring approx. 3 cm. The muscle can also be preserved with a clear connective tissue separating layer. Visualization of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Here too, the facial vein must be ligated and ligated after injury and in the presence of metastases. All in all, difficult dissection conditions with extremely vulnerable vessels and multiple vascular injuries. Free dissection of the internal jugular vein and double vascular suture. However, here too, exposure preserving continuity overall. Exposure and preservation of the accessorius nerve. This can also be easily detached from the metastasis. Release of the accessorius triangle and release of level V, also exposing the vagus nerve and the phrenic nerve and preserving the structures, also preserving the cervical plexus. Anteriorly, the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve were preserved. Now, after wound inspection and interim demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>, detachment of the infrahyoid musculature on the right side and skeletonization of the larynx. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea. Overall relatively high larynx. Exposure of the first 3 to 4 tracheal clasps. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage horn. Selective coagulation of the laryngeal bundle. Exposure of the hyoid. Now detachment of the perichondrium from the thyroid cartilage on the right side. Now, after dislocation of the hyoid, entry laterally on the right above the hyoid. The entrance here is in the area of the pharyngeal side wall, slightly above the vallecula and at a safe distance of approx. 1 cm from the tumor. As described above, the tumor is located submucosally in the vallecula, consuming and breaking through the epiglottis. A strip of the base of the tongue is resected to obtain a safety margin, but there is clearly no macroscopic or palpatory infiltration. Resection of the tumor with a good 1 cm safety margin and soft tissue on all sides in the depth. The hypopharyngeal side wall, especially the piriform sinus, is free on all sides. Resection along the aryepiglottic fold and narrow postcricoidal separation here. This region is far from being reached by the tumor. Now release the laryngeal skeleton while carefully preserving the pharyngeal tube and maintaining a strong muscle mantle. Careful protection of the oesophagus and then tracheotomy. Resection of 2 tracheal clips with relatively high trachea. Angled removal of the trachea and thus the tumor. Snaring and incision of the trachea anteriorly. Now inspection of the tumor and consultation of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. It can now be seen that the tumor, as already described above, moves through the epiglottis towards the supraglottis, moves on the right side towards the arya, infiltrates the pocket fold here, the glottic plane itself is free, as is the subglottis. Now confirmation of the macroscopic in sano resection on the specimen. The tumor is also surrounded on all sides by a soft tissue mantle in depth. The specimen is now thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics and is classified as R0. Therefore, if the pharyngeal mucosa is sufficient and the pharyngeal tube is strong, primary wound closure or reconstruction with local mucosa is performed. Careful submucosal pharyngeal suture with 3.0 SH plus. Countersinking of the corners in the area of the base of the tongue and the caudal pharyngeal suture. Then muscle suture and stitching over the thyroid gland and infrahyoid muscles. Finally, stable pharynx sutured in several layers. Strong adaptation also in the area of the base of the tongue. Final wound inspection of all circumscribed wound cavities. Final hemostasis. Irrigation of the wound with Ringer's solution and, in dry conditions, insertion of a 10-piece Redon drain. Completion of the incision of the tracheostoma with mucocutaneous anastomosis and finally careful, two-layer wound closure and reintubation with a 10-gauge tracheoflex cannula and completion of the procedure at this point without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT4a cN2c oropharyngeal carcinoma. Depending on the definitive histology, adjuvant therapy is indicated. If histology indicates a metastasis, extended staging may be necessary. If the wound is normal, please swallow gruel on the 8th to 9th postoperative day.","Partial pharyngectomy with laryngectomy, Modified radical bilateral neck dissection, Endoscopy, Panendoscopy

PET-CT showed a suspicious FDG accumulation in the area of the right tonsil, which is why a tonsillectomy was indicated before CUP panendoscopy and completion of the neck dissection.","After an initial consultation with the anesthesia colleagues, rigid tracheobronchoscopy is performed after laryngoscopic adjustment of the glottic plane. The glottis, subglottis, trachea and main bronchi were found to be normal and inconspicuous, whereupon the patient was intubated by the surgeon without any problems. The patient is then repositioned for flexible esophagoscopy and gastroscopy: here too, the flexible instrument is inserted into the esophagus without any problems and the patient is visualized under vision as far as the stomach, where a regular folded relief can be seen. On retraction, after aspiration of the air, the esophagus is carefully reflected again, where the mucosal conditions are also normal and inconspicuous. After repositioning the patient again, the hypopharynx and larynx are inspected, where the mucous membrane conditions are also normal and unremarkable in all areas. The base of the tongue is also completely free of irritation and unremarkable on palpation. After repositioning the patient, the mouth retractor is inserted and the oral cavity and oropharynx are inspected. This reveals a clearly enlarged tonsil on the right side, which appears completely non-irritant and inconspicuous on the surface. The mucosal incision is then made close to the uvula and the anterior and posterior palatal arches are sharply dissected. Release of the tonsil at the upper tonsil pole, after exposure, coagulation and separation of the upper pole vessels. The tonsil can then be bluntly dissected from the tonsillar lobe without difficulty. The preparation is carried out with careful hemostasis up to the lower tonsil pole. At the transition to the base of the tongue, the lower pole vessels are carefully coagulated again. Once these have been severed and separated, the tonsil is removed together with a small part of the base of the tongue, the tongue base tonsil. After the intraoperative frozen section diagnosis shows that the tonsil is completely infiltrated by the tumor, the advice is given to resect all areas. This is done in the area of the anterior and posterior palatal arch as well as in the entire area of the tonsil lobe, so that there is a safety margin of about 1 cm from the tonsil bed in all areas. All resections and marginal samples are then found to be tumor-free intraoperatively, so that an R0 resection can be assumed in the primary specimen. Careful hemostasis is then performed again and a nasogastric feeding tube is inserted. Since parapharyngeal fat is exposed here, the patient should be fed via this for a few days. The patient was then repositioned to complete the neck dissection on the right side. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline and then skin incision along the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then dissection in depth to the cervical vascular sheath. This is clearly scarred in the area of the vein angle from the primary lymph node removal. The most careful and laborious dissection is required here. In the end, the entire lateral neck preparation can be lifted laterally from the jugular vein. In the course of long dissection. Exposure, neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the vagus nerve. Dissection, exposure, neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the accessorius nerve. After clearing the accessorius triangle, the entire lateral neck preparation is then dissected and removed from cranial to caudal while sparing the branches of the cervical plexus. The anterior neck preparation is then removed while sparing the branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery. Same procedure in the area of the hypoglossal triangle. Here, too, extremely difficult, laborious dissection with severe scarring. Here too, long-distance dissection after exposure, neurolysis and relocation and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve. During dissection, the branches and branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery are also protected. The final result is a neck dissection of levels I B, II, III, IV and V. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Then insertion of a Redon drain and two-layer wound closure and application of a pressure dressing. Then check the enoral findings again. If the wound is dry, the procedure is then completed. After a final consultation with the anesthesia colleagues, the patient goes to the recovery room after an unremarkable course of anesthesia and problem-free extubation.","Tumor tonsillectomy on the right and Neck dissection

Hypopharyngeal carcinoma in the area of the right piriform sinus with infiltration of the laryngeal skeleton. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure with laryngectomy and partial pharyngectomy was recommended. In the preoperative course, the right-sided lymph node metastases were significantly enlarged. The CT scan performed immediately before the operation showed a primary tumor that was largely unchanged in size and now had a cN3 neck status with a lymph node metastasis measuring over 10 cm on clinical and computed tomography as a conglomerate on the right. There was still no evidence of distant metastasis, so that the primary surgical procedure could be confirmed.","After induction of anesthesia and bronchoscopic intubation by the anesthesia colleagues and preparation of the patient, the first step is positioning. A pharyngo/laryngoscopy is performed. The carcinoma can be seen in the area of the right piriform sinus, which is completely filled in, with fixation of the laryngeal skeleton via the medial wall of the piriform sinus. Endolaryngeal free conditions with clear infiltration of the right hemilarynx on computed tomography and palpation. Confirmation of the indication for laryngectomy. Clinically, there is a monstrous mass on the right with an area of non-displaceable skin measuring approx. 4 x 5 cm. In the area of the remaining mucous membranes, the esophageal entrance is free, as is the posterior wall of the hypopharynx and the entire left side. The patient is now repositioned. Injection of xylocaine with the addition of adrenaline. Form an apron flap by cutting around the palpatorily infiltrated skin. Widening of the incision on the right side around the lobule with infiltration of the caudal parotid pole. On the left side, regular elevation of the apron flap with dissection of the platysma. In the area of the metastasis, careful dissection of the otherwise healthy skin in the surrounding area. In some cases, however, significant inflammatory changes to the skin with redness and vulnerability. Skin incision around the lobule. Dissection of the lobule, exposure of the anterior wall of the auditory canal and exposure of the mastoid. After raising the apron flap, start with the left-sided neck dissection to secure the healthy vessels. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland, including the caudal capsule. Exposure of the digastric muscle, removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the facial vein, the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Dissection of the accessorius triangle with careful protection and dissection of level Va with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Finally, with dry wound conditions, exposure of the left side of the hyoid and release of the hyoid, exposure and skeletonization of the larynx, release of the left-sided laryngeal horn with release of the left-sided piriform sinus. Dissection of the left lobe of the thyroid gland, exposure of the cricoid cartilage and trachea. Now turn to the opposite side. Successive development of the monstrous mass. Caudal exposure of the internal jugular vein, common carotid artery and vagus nerve. Subsequent resection of the mass, which extensively infiltrates the scalenus and paravertebral musculature. Complete infiltration of the cervical plexus roots. The accessory nerve is not visible, the mass can be lifted off the mastoid with the periosteum. Cranially, the tumor clearly infiltrates the caudal part of the parotid gland. Longitudinal approach to the mandible, the submandibular gland is free, but a further metastatic conglomerate can be seen in level Ib after visualization of the pointer. Identification of the facial nerve trunk, which is otherwise left in the remaining glandular part with its subdivision. Clear infiltration of the oral branch, which is resected. Exposure of the mandible, but no infiltration here. The periosteum is also not infiltrated in the area of the mandible. Resection of the conglomerate of Ib with resection of the submandibular gland. Protection of the lingual nerve, which is not infiltrated. Exposure of the intact carotid bulb. Now clear infiltration of the vagus nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. Resection of both nerves as well. Subtotal resection of the external carotid artery branches, the internal carotid artery can be detached from the tumor. Certainly no infiltration here. Finally, after resection of the metastases, some of which extend far into the paravertebral region with surrounding muscle, removal of the conglomerate in toto. This can be accomplished by leaving a small tissue bridge to the primary. No open tumor here. The tumor is now exposed on the right side of the larynx, the thyroid lobe is detached, the piriform sinus is left completely intact on the larynx, the tumor is inserted enorally at the level of the epiglottis, successive development with sparing expansion on the left side in the area of the aryepiglottic fold. Now a good overview of the tumor, which is confirmed as described above. Removal of the tumor with a safety margin of 1.5 cm in the area of the pharyngeal side wall. Postcricoid no growth, also no extension towards the esophageal entrance as described above. Resection of the tumor macroscopically completely in sano, including the laryngeal skeleton, no infiltration of the cricoid cartilage or trachea. At the mucosal level, covering of the tumor with marginal samples, in addition, after close inspection of the pharyngeal tube, small punctiform lesions can now be seen, remote from the tumor in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall and on the left side. Slightly indurated on palpation and macroscopically unclear. Excisional biopsy of one of the lesions in case of possible differential diagnosis of satellite metastasis. In the frozen section diagnostics, all tumor-covering edge samples show carcinoma and dysplasia free, so that an R0 situation is present here. The tumor.................... lesions are lymphoepithelial hyperplasia with at most low-grade dysplasia after complete embedding, so that satellite metastasis can be ruled out here. After completion of the tumor resection, the caudal pharyngeal tube area now shows a sufficiently wide and regular esophageal entrance. Cranially in the area of the pharyngeal side wall at the transition to the base of the tongue, the conditions are somewhat narrow. In conjunction with the completely radical resection of the right-sided soft tissues of the neck with the only remaining common carotid artery, the indication for elevation of a myocutaneous pectoralis major flap with a large muscle portion for soft tissue coverage of the pharyngeal tube and the soft tissues of the neck was established. A left lateral myotomy is performed in the area of the upper esophageal sphincter, an 8.0 mm ............. is placed in the cranial tracheal insertion area; this is successful and without any problems, the anterior wall of the trachea is shortened to position the provost prosthesis at a height, and then the left sternal insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is removed. Marking paramillary of the pectoralis major flap, elevation of a 6.5 x 4.5 cm spindle for insertion in the base of the tongue. Extensive dissection of the pectoralis major muscle and subtotal resection of the muscle. Development of a large-area muscle flap, complete isolation on the vascular pedicle after reliable identification of the vascular bundle. After complete release of the flap, cranial tunneling, insertion of the excellent vital skin island into the pharyngeal defect with closure of the defect, this is achieved without tension and sufficiently. Adaptation of the muscle to the left-sided infrahyoid musculature as well as to the right-sided paravertebral muscle stumps, but good soft tissue coverage of the entire pharyngeal tube, which is now completely covered, as well as coverage of the carotid artery and good soft tissue padding. Careful hemostasis in the chest area. Insertion of two 10-gauge Redon drains and careful, strong wound closure. Then fold back the apron flap, successive suturing of the tracheostoma and careful two-layer wound closure with adaptation of the resected right-sided skin with as little tension as possible. Finally, reintubation to a size 10 low cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed, and completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT4a cN3 right hypopharyngeal carcinoma with multilocular and ..................... deep right cervical metastasis with partial radical parotidectomy and resection of the hypoglossal nerve and vagus nerve. Due to the extent of the tumor, an escalation of adjuvant therapy should be discussed. Please carry out an X-ray pelvis on the 10th postoperative day.","Tumor resection, Neck dissection, Defect coverage, Pedicled flap (Pectoralis major)

Careful dissection of the tongue muscles and careful hemostasis using ligatures and electrocoagulation. After removal of the tumor, a thin layer of muscle is removed caudally as a second sample. Both are sent for final histology. Careful hemostasis and securing of the Wharton's duct, which was not injured during the operation. Demonstration to <CLINICIAN_NAME> and discussion of the further procedure. Joint decision on primary wound closure. The wound edges are carefully adapted and the wound is closed primarily. Handover of the patient to the anesthesia colleagues. Completion of the operation without complications. Conclusion: A T1 squamous cell carcinoma of the lower surface of the right tongue is resected and an inconspicuous panendoscopy is performed in the same session without complications. Intraoperatively endophytically growing ulcer, 1 to 1.3 cm in size, which grows at least 3 to 4 mm into the body of the tongue. Resection with a distance of at least 1 cm in all directions. The tissue was sent for final histological analysis. Further procedure after receipt of the final histology. If tumor infiltration is more than 8 mm, a selective right neck dissection should be performed. Please allow soft food from the 2nd postoperative day. Continue antibiotics with clindamycin for the next 3 days.","Resection and Panendoscopy

Intubation transnasally by the anesthetist. Entry with the flexible gastroesophagoscope and endoscopy into the stomach. Inconspicuous conditions on all sides. If diaphanoscopy is good, perform a PEG insertion using the thread pull-through method. Enter with the Kleinsasser tube and inspect the tumor region. There is an exophytic mass in the area of the left piriform sinus on the lateral and anterior wall. The medial and posterior border of the left piriform sinus is not covered by the tumor. The postcricoid and arytenoid region of the larynx is free on both sides. The vocal fold level and the pocket fold level as well as the epiglottis are also not affected by the tumor. It was therefore decided not to perform a complete laryngectomy. Now injection of xylocaine-adrenaline mixture in the throat area. Sterile washing and draping. Creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Start with the neck dissection on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. It becomes clear that the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein cannot be preserved on this side, so switch to the right side. Carry out the neck dissection on the right side to ensure that the internal jugular vein can be preserved here. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. The entire length of the internal jugular vein can be preserved, including the outlet of the facial vein and the facial vein itself. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and the superior thyroid. Release of the medial neck block and then release of the neck block II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. This is successful without any problems. Then transfer to the opposite side and release of the medial neck block with detachment of a 5 x 3 cm metastasis in level II a. This is very difficult as the mass cannot be detached from the jugular vein. This is detached in the area at the border to level III. If the facial vein is very deep, the facial vein itself may remain intact. The sternocleidomastoid muscle must be partially resected and the accessory nerve must also be resected, as it runs directly into the tumor. The metastasis is now successively detached from the internal and external carotid artery. This can be done bluntly with the stalk to ensure that there is no infiltration of these vessels. Finally, the metastasis must also be bluntly detached from the vagus nerve and also from the hypoglossal nerve. Dissection in this area is generally very difficult. Ultimately, the metastasis is successfully detached from the nerves and vessels mentioned above and from the base of the skull. The remaining neck regions are then cleared out while sparing the remaining plexus branches. Entering the pharynx below the hyoid bone from the right side. Inspection of the tumor. This is localized as described above for pharyngoscopy. It is completely incised with a safety margin of 1.5 cm and is marked with a suture for the frozen section. The frozen section shows a complete R0 situation without carcinoma in situ, invasive carcinoma or dysplasia in the marginal area. As there is ultimately sufficient mucosa in the pharyngeal area, the decision is made to perform primary wound closure. This is usually carried out in two layers. As the mucosa is very thin in places and is somewhat under tension in some areas, the thyroid gland and the infrahyal muscles are stitched over the suture area. Finally, two Redon drains are inserted and a two-layer wound closure is performed. A tracheotomy was performed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage before the tumor resection. Creation of a visor tracheotomy without Björk flap. Epithelialization of the tracheal margins with the skin. Insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit in an awake state and should receive 3 days of intravenous antibiotics with Unacid and on the 10th postoperative day an X-ray vomit swallow, then if there is no fistula, removal of the nasogastric tube and implementation of the diet. Postoperative presentation of the patient at the tumor conference to plan adjuvant radiochemotherapy.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, PEG placement, Tracheostomy

This can be seen freely up to the carina and is non-irritating. Then intubation by the surgeon with Cormack I. The flexible esophagoscope is then inserted and the esophagus is visualized through to the stomach, where the mucosa is free of irritation on all sides. Retract the esophagoscope and enter with the small bore tube. Inspection of the oropharynx. This shows the previously described mass at the upper left tonsil pole. Mirroring forward to the posterior pharyngeal wall and hypopharynx. Inconspicuous on all sides. Inspection of the piriform sinus and the entrance to the esophagus as well as the postcricoid region and the arytenoid region. No tumorous masses. Adjustment of the glottic plane and inspection of the vocal folds and pocket folds including the anterior commissure. No abnormalities here.

Then inspection of the alveolar ridges. A suspicious change in the mucosa in region III/VII to VIII can be seen on the alveolar ridge on the lower jaw. This is biopsied. Then inspection of the alveolar ridge on the left side of the maxilla. There is actually no suspicious mass here, but as a contrast agent uptake was described in regions II/IV to II/VI on the CT, this region was also biopsied. Hemostasis by insertion of hydrogen swabs and bipolar coagulation. The operation was completed with dry blood, without complications. Conclusion: cT1 cN0 tonsillar carcinoma on the left. Neck dissection on the left side should be planned, if necessary with resection if the marginal samples are not healthy. If the samples from the alveolar ridges also show carcinoma or carcinoma in situ, the patient should be presented to the maxillofacial clinic.","Tumor resection, Panendoscopy, PE (Proximal esophagus) in the upper and lower jaw

Inspection of the oropharynx. A clear tonsillar hyperplasia on the left with intratonsillar thickening and coarse changes is clearly suspicious, but based on the palpation findings it is more likely to be an intratonsillar tumor than a lymphoma. The rest of the oropharynx is unremarkable and free except for a left-sided circumscribed vallecula cyst. Demonstration of findings also on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequently, in case of cT2 tonsillar carcinoma, perform a right tumor tonsillectomy. For this purpose, incision at the anterior palatal arch with subtotal removal of the anterior palatal arch.

The panendoscopy performed in <2016> revealed a mass extending from the hypopharyngeal side wall on the left via the postcricoid region to the esophageal inlet. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.,"Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the hypopharynx and larynx. The tumor begins just below the tonsil lobe on the left side, extends caudally along the hypopharyngeal side wall, infiltrates the piriform sinus completely on the left side, infiltrates the postcricoid region on both sides and continues to grow into the esophageal entrance, infiltrating it caudally for approx. 2 cm. In addition, there is a demarcated oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left side, which exists on the side wall of the oropharynx independently of the hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Positioning of the patient. Sterile washing and draping, after injection and application of an apron flap in the usual manner. Start by releasing the larynx. To do this, the hyoid bone is released, then the infrahyal muscles are detached and the oblique laryngeal muscles are detached. Perform a tracheotomy below the cricoid cartilage and transfer to a laryngectomy tube. Detachment of the thyroid gland from the thyroid cartilage skeleton on both sides. This shows that the thyroid gland on the left side is also infiltrated. It is therefore first partially resected and later completely. The piriform sinus is then released on the right side; this is not possible on the left side. On the left side, it is already clear when the larynx is released that the tumor breaks outwards almost into the soft tissues of the neck. For this reason, a suture marker is placed at a questionable location and a representative sample is taken from the soft tissue, including a marginal sample. The marginal sample was tumor-free in the frozen section. Entering the pharynx from the right side. Disluxation of the epiglottis and resection of the mucosa and tumor with integration of the oropharyngeal carcinoma and resection of the esophageal inlet and removal of the larynx below the cricoid cartilage. The tumor is thread-marked in its entirety in the frozen section. All margins are free of tumor in the frozen section. In the area of the thyroid gland, the safety margin is less than 0.5 cm. Therefore, the tumor is resected again and the remaining thyroid gland is also removed and sent to the frozen section again, also thread-marked. Now everything is tumor-free. Measurement of the defect. The result was an 18 x 8 cm defect. A left lateral esophagomyotomy was performed very carefully and then the esophagus was incised in the middle to create a V-shaped entrance. The radialis flap will later be fitted into this V-shaped entrance. For this purpose, the radialis flap is also configured in a V-shape at the tip. Then lift the radialis graft. Lifting of the radialis flap by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Drawing the flap boundaries in the presence of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. An 8 x 16 cm graft is drawn in. S-shaped incision along the skin incision in the area of the proximal forearm. Incision of the distal flap borders with separation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection in the area of the venous confluence in the crook of the elbow and identification of the superficial and deep venous system. A pronounced cephalic vein can be seen, which is integrated into the radial flap margin, extending radially. After identification of the external radial nerve ramus, it can be safely spared. Ulnar skin incision down to the deep forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subfascial dissection of the flap from ulnar to radial. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum intact. Dissection up to the edge of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Identification of the vascular pedicle and application of a vascular clamp for approx. 10 minutes: during this time a good perfusion signal is continuously measured. Decision to place the flap on the distal radial stump. Clamping and cutting of the radial artery and the vena comitans. Ligation of the stent. Dissection of the vascular pedicle, also from the depths, with constant blood supply using bipolar coagulation and vascular clips. The radial nerve can be safely identified and protected on the inside of the brachioradialis muscle. Insertion of a retractor between the extensor carpi radialis muscle and the brachioradialis muscle. Dissection in the area of the bifurcation of the brachioradial artery. Now pull in <CLINICIAN_NAME> and remove first the artery and then the veins. The flap can be lifted without complications. The radial artery as well as a deep and a superficial vein are available for anastomosis. This is followed by elevation of an equivalent area of split skin from the right thigh through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the s-shaped, proximal skin incision on the forearm. Incision of the split-thickness skin graft in the usual manner. Application of a wound dressing and a dorsal forearm splint. Application of a wrap bandage. Neck dissection is performed on both sides at the same time as flap lifting. To do this, expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side, the omohyoid muscle of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Then free preparation of the cervical vascular sheath while preserving the facial vein and the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve as well as the accessorius nerve and then release of the neck preparation II a to V a while preserving the plexus branches. Then switch to the opposite side. Here too, expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Here too, free preparation of the internal jugular vein and the cervical vascular sheath. Then release the neck preparations II a to V a while protecting the plexus branches and the hypoglossal and accessory nerves. Deposition of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and closure of the wound on the forearm with split skin from the right thigh by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Reposition the patient and perform the arterial and venous anastomosis. The superior thyroid artery, the facial vein and an outlet from the facial vein are used for this. The cephalic vein and a vein of the deep venous system of the arm are anastomosed. The radialis graft is then inserted and reconstruction of the esophageal inlet begins. For this purpose, the V-shaped defect is reconstructed through the tip of the radialis flap, which is also V-shaped. To do this, sutures are placed and then the remaining graft is sutured in place. At the end, repositioning of the apron flap and suturing of the tracheostoma. A Provox prosthesis is not possible as the esophageal entrance was too deeply infiltrated and the anterior wall had to be reconstructed with the radial flap and this will also not be possible secondarily. At the end, insertion of two Redon drains and two-layer wound closure. The flap pedicle can be doubled in the middle of the neck. A skin monitor was not possible due to the short length of the stalk, but the flap can be checked via the Doppler and also at the base of the tongue via direct inspection. At the very end, the upper edge of the flap is punctured using a cannula. A good arterial blood return is seen immediately. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. After consultation with the surgeon, please continue with the X-ray paps and antibiotics for at least 24 hours.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Free flap (Radial)

An extensive exophytic mass was found, which covered the entire vallecula, infiltrated the base of the tongue on the left side and also infiltrated the lingual epiglottis up to the base. The tumor extends laterally to the pharyngo-epiglottic fold, but does not pass through it, so that the piriform sinus itself is free. Now add the flexible esophagoscope and endoscopy of the esophagus. Advance the instrument into the stomach. If the diaphanoscopy is positive, PEG insertion using the thread pull-through method and if the tent phenomenon is positive. The insertion is successful without any problems. Then suction out the insufflated air after fixing the PEG and withdrawing the esophagoscope. The patient is then repositioned. Now extremely laborious insertion of the TORS blocker. The tumor is only partially exposed. A complete overview is initially not possible due to the bulging base of the tongue. After insertion and docking of the DaVinci robot. Then first retraction of the base of the tongue. The full extent of the tumor can now be seen. Therefore, first traverse the tumor borders with the monopolar spatula. The tumor infiltrates the base of the tongue on the left side. Therefore, start resection at the base of the tongue. Extremely careful dissection here after the resection extends into the depths. However, the lingual artery is not exposed and remains intact. Then resection laterally and medially. Capture the tumor border in the vallecula. This crosses the midline here. Then further resection of the epiglottis. It can be seen that the tumor has almost completely infiltrated the lingual surface of the epiglottis, so that a complete epiglottectomy must be performed. The pocket folds and the endolaryngeal supraglottis are completely tumor-free. The two arytenoid cartilages are also spared from the resection and remain intact. The resection is then performed laterally via the pharyngo-epiglottic fold. Finally, the tumor can be incised in depth and resected in several parts using a piecemeal technique. Representative marginal samples are then taken from the medial as well as lateral, ventral, dorsal and deep settling areas. Some vascular stumps, particularly on the lateral pharyngeal wall, are first exposed and then clipped. A dry wound surface is then revealed underneath. All frozen sections are diagnosed intraoperatively by the pathology colleagues as tumor-free. If the wound is dry, the DaVinci robot is undocked. The patient was then repositioned for ipsilateral neck dissection on the left side. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline. Then incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth in layers. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the posterior digaster venter muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and subsequent insertion of the retractors. Then dissection of the glandular capsule. Clearing of the hypoglossal triangle with exposure of the hypoglossus while sparing all branches of the external carotid artery and internal jugular artery. Followed by a long dissection of the cervical vascular sheath with exposure and protection of the vagus nerve. Subsequent removal of the lateral neck preparation. Then clearing of the ventral neck preparation up to the upper edge of the thyroid gland. Here too, all vessels and nerves are protected. This results in a neck dissection level Ib, II, III, IV and V. A Redon drain is then inserted and the wound is closed in several layers. The patient is then repositioned, initially for tracheotomy. Here too, injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline. Then skin incision in the sense of a modified Kocher incision. Layer-by-layer preparation in depth. Dissection and ligation of several larger pretracheal veins. Then locate the midline and separate the muscles. Further layered dissection in depth. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Once this has been undermined, clamp off the thyroid isthmus on both sides and cut through it. The thyroid gland is then repositioned on both sides and the front of the trachea is exposed. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Then incision of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp. Opening of the trachea. Preparation of a Björk flap. Then suturing of the tracheostoma in the sense of a circular mucocutaneous anastomosis. The patient is then repositioned for neck dissection on the right side. The procedure here is identical to that on the left side. Here too, a skin incision is made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Expose the omohyoid muscle and digaster venter posterior muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and insertion of the retractors. Clearing of the hypoglossal triangle while sparing all branches of the external carotid artery, the internal jugular artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Long dissection of the cervical vascular sheath while sparing the vagus nerve. Dissection of the lateral neck preparation and the anterior neck preparation, again sparing all vascular and nerve structures. This also results in a level Ib to V neck dissection. Subtle hemostasis is also performed here. Then insertion of a Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. The patient is then intubated from the transnasal tube to the tracheostomy tube. This is done without difficulty. After applying a cervical pressure bandage on both sides, the procedure is completed. On the ipsilateral tumor side, several enlarged lymph nodes in the sense of an N2b neck status were found. The right side was clinically unremarkable. Therefore, this is at least a T3 hypopharyngeal carcinoma with a clinical N2b neck status. The final further procedure must then be decided at the interdisciplinary tumor conference after receipt of the final histology.","TORS resection, Tracheotomy, Neck dissection, PEG placement

In our tumor conference <2014> a tumor resection with neck dissection and functional cyst in the left lobe of the thyroid gland was determined.,"After transnasal intubation of the patient by the anesthesia colleague, the patient is positioned. Insertion of the Jennings mouth retractor and inspection of the oral cavity. An exophytic mass with a diameter of 2.4 x 1.4 cm is found at the edge of the tongue/under the tongue in the middle of the posterior 1/3 of the free tongue. The palpatory mass partially grows into the tongue musculature. Next, the tongue is pulled out. An incision is now made in the mucosa 1-1.2 cm from the macroscopic edge of the tumor. Dissection in depth and simultaneous targeted bipolar coagulation. Approx. 1.5 cm of the tongue musculature was removed in depth together with the main preparation. Careful resection down to the tongue musculature. After dissection, the resection margin was sharply separated. Nerve fibers of the lingual nerve are identified here, resected and sent separately for histological analysis. Targeted bipolar hemostasis from bleeding vessels. Exposure of the whartonian duct at the posterior lower resection margin. After removal of the specimen, the specimen is marked and sent for frozen section analysis. Tamponade of the oral cavity and sterile washing and covering of the right side of the neck. As the patient has several secondary diseases, the administration of infiltration was not authorized. Creation of an 8 cm skin incision on the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid. Sharp transection of the platysma and identification of the superficial cervical fascia. Resection of the connecting vein between the anterior jugular artery and the external jugular artery. Identification of the auricularis magnus nerve and preservation of the same. Then cranial dissection and identification of the marginal ramus and facial nerve. Next, dissection in depth until identification of the anterior sternocleidomastoid. Level III revealed a very interestingly split sternocleidomastoid muscle. Even in this area, 2 different heads (attachment to the sternum and attachment to the clavicle) are identified. Further dissection cranially until identification of the accessorius nerve. Level IIb is completely dissected above the accessorius nerve and the internal jugular vein is exposed. Level IIb is then pulled out under the accessorius nerve. Further dissection along the sternocleidomastoid muscle in depth. After identification of the cervical plexus posteriorly and the omohyoid muscle caudally, the lateral preparations are detached from lateral to medial. The cervical vascular sheath is then identified and dissected above the jugular vein and the carotid artery anteriorly. Then identification of the infrahyoid musculature and slow dissection from bottom to top. Preservation of the neurovascular structures, in particular the hypoglossal nerve and lingual artery. The preparation is then removed practically in one piece. Next, dissection in level Ia. A relatively large lymph node is removed separately above the submandibular gland and medially from the submandibular gland in the area of the facial artery and sent separately for histological analysis. Here, demonstration of the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Decision to remove level Ia. After identification of the anterior venter, digastric muscle and corpus ossis hyoidei, level Ia is systematically dissected from caudal to cranial. Upward identification of the mylohyoid muscle and sharp separation of the specimen from the muscle. The specimen is sent separately in one piece for histological analysis. Targeted bipolar hemostasis in all regions. In the event of absolute hemostasis, a size C Redon drain is placed. Wound closure in layers. Then transition to the oral cavity. After removing the compresses, targeted bipolar hemostasis is performed from the small bleeding vessels in the tongue musculature. Layered primary closure of the edge of the tongue on the right. If the postoperative aspect is relatively dry, the patient is handed over to the anesthesia colleague. Completion of the surgical procedure without complications. Conclusion: Resection of tongue margin carcinoma cT2 cN0 cM0 on the right and selective neck dissection level Ia to level IV on the right is performed without complications. For technical reasons, puncture from the left lobe of the thyroid gland was postponed. Intraoperative frozen section examination showed a distance of more than 0.5 cm from the lateral edges and at least 0.5 cm in the basal area. Therefore, primary wound closure at the right tongue margin. In case of unfavorable histological criteria and depth of infiltration and infiltration of the lingual nerve, adjuvant radiochemotherapy should be performed. If an intraoperative injury to tooth 23 is suspected, the patient should be seen by a dentist postoperatively. Postoperatively, antibiotics with Unacid 3 x 3 g and Clont 3 x 500 mg should be administered for the next 3 days under gastric protection. Redon drainage depending on progress. Early mobilization. Soft food build-up possible from the 2nd postoperative day.","Partial glossectomy, Selective right neck dissection

A gross needle biopsy of the cervical lymph node metastasis on the left side revealed infiltration by a squamous cell carcinoma. After an unremarkable panendoscopy, a PET-CT was performed, which showed bilateral enhancement in the tonsil region on both sides, which is why a tumor tonsillectomy was indicated.","Preliminary consultation with the anesthetist. Insertion of the mouth guard. Inspection of the oral cavity and oropharynx, where a suspicious formation is seen in the area of the tonsils on both sides. On the left side, this is now relatively clear compared to the panendoscopy a few weeks ago, which is why a tumor tonsillectomy is performed on the left side. On the right side, a biopsy is taken from the tonsil. The tumor tonsillectomy and the biopsy of the tonsil on the right side both go to frozen section diagnostics. Surprisingly, both findings were found to be infiltration by a tonsillar carcinoma in the frozen section. Subsequently, resection in the area of the left tonsil, in the area of the anterior and posterior palatal arch and dissection down to the muscles of the pharynx. Significant resection in the area of the posterior palatal arch, where the frozen section also showed infiltrates of the tonsillar carcinoma. Here, new specimens are taken from the margins, representing the entire margins of the deposit including the deep deposit towards the pharyngeal muscle area. All findings are diagnosed as tumor-free in the frozen section. Creation of a palatal arch plasty. Perform a subtle hemostasis. Since no fatty tissue is exposed here, neck dissection of the left side should be possible without any problems. Then perform the tumor tonsillectomy after obtaining the frozen section on the right side. The tumor appears to be limited exclusively to the tonsil. Here too, resection is performed down to the area of the pharyngeal muscles. Representative marginal samples are then taken and also sent for frozen section examination. These marginal samples are also diagnosed as tumor-free in the frozen section. Creation of a palatal arch plasty. Subtle hemostasis is then also performed here. Repositioning of the patient to attempt PEG placement. This was performed without any problems up to the stomach. A hiatal hernia is suspected here. If the diaphanoscopy is not positive, the PEG tube is not inserted. In this case, the gastroenterology or surgical colleagues should insert the PEG. Decision to insert a nasogastric feeding tube for the postoperative phase. This works without any problems. The patient is repositioned for neck dissection on both sides: Start on the left side. The metastasis has broken through at the posterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle with infiltration of the skin. Therefore, the incision was moved slightly dorsally and a skin spindle was cut around. At the dorsal edge of the resection, a sample was taken from the edge of the skin, which was still diagnosed as tumor infiltrated in the frozen section. Therefore, resection in this area and resubmission of frozen sections after renewed removal of marginal samples. Subsequently, further dissection and visualization of the cervical vascular sheath. It became apparent that the metastasis had completely infiltrated both the branches of the auricularis magnus nerve and the accessorius nerve from the deep cervical fascia, so that a modified radical neck dissection with partial resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the accessorius nerve had to be performed. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the auricularis magnus nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Only the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle remains to cover the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure, long-distance dissection and displacement as well as re-embedding of the vagus nerve at the end of the operation in the sense of a neurolysis. Subsequent further dissection of the entire lateral neck in terms of levels II, III, IV and V. Dissection of the cervical vascular sheath and here dissection of the anterior neck preparation. There are conspicuously enlarged lymph nodes everywhere. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and clearing of the hypoglossal triangle. All branches of the external carotid artery and internal jugular vein are spared. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. This results in a neck dissection of level I b up to and including V. The specimen is sent for histopathological evaluation. With a free marginal specimen in the area of the skin's edge, two-layer wound closure. Insertion of a Redon drainage. Transition to neck dissection of the right side. Here too, skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth in layers and exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. A larger metastasis can be seen in the area of the venous angle, which lies on the hypoglossal nerve and must be dissected away from it. Clearing of the hypoglossal triangle. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and long-distance dissection of the contents of the cervical vascular sheath with the vessels and the vagus nerve. Long-distance dissection of the accessorius nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the vagus nerve and accessorius nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Clearing of the entire lateral neck preparation in the sense of levels II to V. Numerous suspiciously enlarged lymph nodes are also found here. After careful hemostasis, there is no further resistance on palpation. Again, evacuation of the anterior neck preparation and further subtle hemostasis. Irrigation of the wound. Two-layer wound closure. Insertion of a Redon drain. Application of a pressure dressing on both sides. Final consultation with the anesthetist.

Laser resection not possible due to extremely poor adjustability. Surgery primarily planned with tumor removal from the outside.","This is followed by bronchoscopic intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Followed by pharyngoscopy again: once again, the small bore tube size C and D is used. Although the tumor can be visualized, its extent is barely detectable with the small bore tube. This once again confirms the indication for an external approach. This is followed by repositioning, injection of a total of 20 ml xylocaine 1% with adrenaline in the area of both sides of the neck and sterile draping. Start with modified apron flaps: The right apron flap is lifted in a typical manner, slightly widened caudally on the left, in order to also develop a platysmal flap from this to cover the defect in the tongue base area if necessary. The flap is elevated to the level of the hyoid bone or the submandibular gland. Neck dissection on the left side: exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle anterior border. Dissection of lymph node fat packet. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein, internal/external carotid artery. Exposure of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve. Development of the dorsal neck preparation with exposure and preservation of the branches of the cervical plexus. Then develop the anterior neck preparation, exposing and preserving the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure and preservation of the cervical artery. This results in an evacuation of levels II to V on the left. Neck dissection on the right side: This is performed in the same way as on the left side, exposing the structures mentioned, which are also preserved. Level II to IV removal is performed here, followed by transcervical tumor resection: exposure and skeletonization of the hyoid bone. The pre-epiglottic fatty tissue is completely removed behind the hyoid bone. This is also removed from the right to the left of the epiglottis and integrated into the tumor preparation. Right paramedian entry into the larynx at the level of the epiglottis. The tumor can now be visualized, viewed with relative difficulty and successively removed by means of inspection and palpation. Tumor is incised on all sides with a safety margin of 1 to 1.5 cm and removed in toto. Two thirds of the epiglottis is freed from the lingual mucosa. The left pharyngeal wall is removed, the base of the tongue is removed by about two thirds, whereby the resection to the right is not too deep, so that the lingualis can be spared here. Resection extends in the area of the pharyngeal wall to just before the tonsil lobe. Tumor is removed and marked with a suture. Due to the relative proximity caudally in the area of the epiglottis, a strip of mucosa is removed from the epiglottis area, which corresponds to the rest of the epiglottis mucosa lingually. The tumor is removed in the frozen section towards all edges in the healthy area, but small focal in-situ infiltrations are still visible in the area of the mucosa sample of the remainder of the lingual epiglottis. Therefore, the tip of the epiglottis is removed, the left third and a thick strip of mucosa in the direction of the arytenoid fold and pharyngeal wall. This preparation is thread-marked and sent for frozen section examination, whereby the side remote from the tumor is marked. There are no more infiltrates here, so that an R0 resection can now be assumed. This results in a defect of two thirds of the tongue base mucosa area, the pharyngeal wall on the left, from the tonsil lobe to the hypopharyngeal entrance and supraglottic on the left including the aryepiglottic fold. The three-dimensional shape of the defect is measured. The radial flap is now elevated: Flap size is drawn in according to the three-dimensional requirements. The skin monitor is also drawn in. Then angle the arm and apply a tourniquet. Gradually develop the radial artery flap from subfascial, taking subcutaneous tissue with it, if necessary for the skin monitor. The radial artery is placed caudally and supplied proximally and distally using 4.0 Prolene puncture ligatures. Outgoing smaller vessels to the muscles are supplied with clips. Confluence of the radial vein, radial artery and cephalic artery can be exposed in the elbow area. A running cutaneous nerve can also be dissected and lifted along with the flap. After opening the tourniquet, good perfusion of the flap and the skin monitor. Deposition of the flap, whereby the outlet of the radial artery is treated with a 4.0 Prolene stitch. Veins are ligated. Flap vessels are flushed with heparin and placed in saline compresses. The flap is then sutured into the defect: Once the flap has been placed in the correct position, it is sutured successively using 3.0 Vicryl single-button sutures. Tension-free suturing with complete closure. Flap handle is passed through from left to right. The flap is connected in an end-to-end anastomosis between the radial artery and the superior thyroid artery using 9.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After releasing the clamp, good perfusion and good venous return. The flap vein and facial vein are then conditioned. After measuring the vascular lumen, the anastomosis is performed without complications using a 3 mm vascular coupler. After opening the clamps, good reflux, positive smear phenomenon. Overall good perfusion of the flap. Co-prepared cutaneous nerve is now adapted on the left side to the stump of the superior laryngeal nerve, which had to be sacrificed during tumor resection, using several Ethilon 9.0 sutures to sensitize the radial lobe. Subsequent tracheostoma creation: splitting of the thyroid isthmus and coagulation. This is very thin and rudimentary. Visualization of the anterior tracheal wall. Entering the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space and creation of a broadly pedicled Björk flap. Epithelialization of this. Re-intubation and insertion of a 9 mm tracheal cannula. This is followed by irrigation of the wound area with H2O2 and Ringer's solution, as directly after the tumor resection, as well as at the end of the entire operation, and careful hemostasis. Insertion of a Redon drain into each side. Repositioning of the apron flap. Skin incision at the level of the skin monitor and insertion of the skin monitor. This is fixed in the skin without tension using subcutaneous sutures and skin sutures. The wound is then closed in layers in the area of the apron flap and the epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Full-thickness skin removal from the groin: Depending on the size of the defect, a piece of skin, approx. 8 x 6 cm, is harvested from the groin as a full-thickness skin graft. This is thinned out. In the groin area, after mobilization of the skin, the wound is closed in layers and a Redon drain is inserted with minimal tension. After thinning, the removed full-thickness skin is sutured into the area of the forearm defect without tension. The forearm is closed in layers. A sterile Vacuseal dressing is then applied, which works with a suction of 75 mmHg. The arm is then wrapped in a Kramer splint using an elastic bandage. Then mark the localization for vascular control with the Doppler. The cannula is fixed with tape. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient received Unacid intraoperatively as an antibiotic. Please continue postoperatively for 1 week. Heparin at 500 units per hour, as started intraoperatively, continue for 5 days postoperatively. Feeding via the previously inserted PEG tube for approx. 10 days, then gruel swallow and swallowing attempt, if necessary diet build-up, but intensive swallowing training is certainly necessary here. Please contact the voice and speech department or speech therapist at an early stage. Overall cT2-3 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left, postoperative RT or RCT to be discussed after histological findings.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy

Due to the patient's poor general condition, primary radiochemotherapy is not an option, therefore the above-mentioned operation is indicated.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation via the patient's existing tracheostoma, the operation is first planned during pharyngoscopy. This reveals a right-sided, exophytic tumor, which extends in the area of the oropharyngeal side wall to the tonsil and then affects the pharyngoepiglottic fold, involves the entire right piriform sinus and also clearly affects the postcricoid region in the area of the right side, almost completely encloses the lateral piriform sinus laterally, but only slightly affects the posterior pharyngeal wall posteriorly. In the larynx, the epiglottis is partially affected, the right aryepiglottic fold, the right arytenoid cartilage and the pocket folds are completely affected. The tumor grows over the interarytenoid region into the postcricoid region. The left arytenoid cartilage and the left aryepiglottic fold are tumor-free, as are the vallecula and more than half of the epiglottis. Deep down, the left piriform sinus is completely free, but the entrance to the esophagus is stenosed and it is not possible to determine exactly to what extent the entrance to the esophagus is affected, but this can be assumed based on the fixation. Discussion of findings with <CLINICIAN_NAME> and procedure for surgery. First, formation of an apron flap, which extends from the tracheostoma to the far lateral side. Then create the apron flap, partly with the help of the BiClamp system. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides and form the apron flap up to above the hyoid bone. Now turn to the neck dissection of the right side. The very prominent, partially fixed lump can be easily palpated here. An attempt is first made to dissect the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein, but it quickly becomes apparent that they are completely infiltrated by the tumor. The decision is now made to perform a radical neck dissection. The posterior digastric venter muscle and the submandibular gland are exposed and isolated. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is then imaged in the cranial region. The accessorius nerve can also be identified here and initially spared. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is then resected in its caudal area and the same is done in its cranial area, taking care to spare the part of the accessorius nerve that goes towards the trapezius muscle. Now continue to form the lateral border of the neck. Deep exposure of the plexus branches and the scalene muscles in their lateral area. Then complete visualization of the internal jugular vein in its caudal and cranial course. Identify the hypoglossal nerve and spare the last one. The internal jugular vein is now ligated twice and separated cranially and caudally. Prior to this, the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve were identified and spared. In addition to the large tumor, which appears to be fixed towards the thyroid cartilage, there are also additional tumor conglomerates in level IIa. Now turn to the medial neck preparation. To do this, follow the omohyoid muscle anteriorly and the digastric muscle anteriorly. Then form the medial neck preparation along the thyroid cartilage muscles. This reveals a site between the thyroid cartilage and the hyoid bone where the tumor conglomerate is connected to the actual tumor per continuitatem. This site is cut and marked on both the thyroid cartilage and the tumor. The medial neck preparation is then followed up, sparing the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery, which is clamped. Then expose the carotid artery from caudal to cranial and also the vagus nerve from caudal to cranial. Now turn again to level II b and here further development of the lateral neck preparation from cranial to caudal while sparing the plexus branches. At the end, the entire neck preparation is formed in a large block. Now turn to the neck dissection of the left side. No large lymph node metastases are visible here, therefore expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Formation of the anterior border and visualization of the posterior digastric venter muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Identify the accessorius nerve and then form the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial. Here, after identifying and sparing the vagus nerve, the lateral neck preparation is formed while sparing the accessorius nerve and plexus branches. Then turn to the medial neck preparation. Trace the omohyoid muscle, trace the digastric muscle anteriorly and expose and skeletonize the submandibular gland and spare the facial vein. After identifying the hypoglossal nerve, the medial neck preparation is also formed, whereby the superior thyroid artery is also spared. Preparation for laryngectomy/partial pharyngectomy. Preparation of the tracheostoma. Exposure of the right thyroid gland from the trachea while protecting the blood supply. Then expose the cervical vascular sheath on the left side from the laryngeal preparation down to the vertebral body. Further cranial ligation of the bundle of the superior laryngeal nerve and skeletonization in the upper area with monopolar coagulation of the hyoid bone. Now the constrictor pharyngeal muscle on the left side of the thyroid cartilage is also cut with the monopolar and the upper thyroid cartilage horn is exposed. Then, with the help of the Freer raspatory, expose the piriform sinus from the inner side of the thyroid cartilage. Now turn to the right side. As described above, this shows a tumor breakthrough between the thyroid cartilage and hyoid bone, which is why the constrictor pharyngis muscle is not exposed here. Only the carotid artery is exposed from the laryngeal preparation. It can also be seen that the right lobe of the thyroid gland is severely regressively altered with cystic areas and a fixation to the tumor. For this reason, the right thyroid lobe is also isolated from the surrounding tissue, with the inferior thyroid artery and the middle thyroid vein ligated and ligated. The right thyroid lobe thus remains on the subsequent tumor specimen. Now, after previously skeletonizing the hyoid bone, the transoral localization of the epiglottis and the submucosal dissection along the left lingual epiglottis cartilage is performed through the neck. The pharynx is then opened on the left side and initially dissected along the left aryepiglottic fold. It can be seen that the tumor clearly involves the oropharynx on the right side, as already described above. The entire right hypopharynx is full of exophytic tumor. The resection is now extended to the right via the right base of the tongue, then to the right tonsil. Previously, the internal carotid artery was traced far to the cranial side in order to isolate it from the pharynx and the lingual artery was ligated and cut. The resection is now extended to the left via the aryepiglottic fold to the left arytenoid cartilage. However, the postcricoid region is affected up to the midline and cannot be preserved. An attempt is made to preserve the left piriform sinus, but it is suspected that the tumor is also growing submucosally through the thyroid cartilage to the left piriform sinus. A frozen section sample is therefore taken here, which is later found to contain tumor. The resection now continues caudally. On the right side, a good part of the posterior pharyngeal wall is resected, on the left side a little of the postcricoid region can be spared. The esophageal entrance is now reached. It can be seen here that the tumor infiltrates the esophageal entrance on its anterior and right side. The specimen is removed here and a marginal sample is also taken, which is later found to be tumor-infested. Another problem area is the base of the tongue, which is also infiltrated at certain points and, after consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, it is suspected that infiltrated regions repeatedly appear between the base of the tongue and the esophageal opening on the right side. Therefore, after careful assessment of the situation, <CLINICIAN_NAME> decided to perform a complete pharyngectomy and also a resection in the area of the esophageal inlet. Prior to this, part of the base of the tongue is resected and a frozen section is performed again, which is later found to be tumor-free. This is followed by pharyngectomy and a myotomy of the upper esophageal sphincter in the caudal region and a resection in the anterior and right-accentuated region. All frozen sections are later found to be tumor-free. Radial flap elevation and the formation of a complete pharyngeal replacement are now performed, which is dictated separately by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The resulting defect in the area of the left forearm is approximately 10 x 15 cm long and is removed with 2 strips of split skin, 0.7 mm thick, from the area of the right thigh and then painstakingly sutured in place. Finally, the Mepilex insert is applied to both regions, the thigh and the forearm, and the forearm is bandaged with a splint. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME> Patient with histologically confirmed incontinuitous growing cT4a laryngeal carcinoma on the right. Therefore above mentioned surgical indication. Flap coverage included in the surgical planning preoperatively. After completion of the pharyngectomy, the marginal specimens in the tongue base area and the circular marginal specimen in the esophageal entrance area were finally free of carcinoma. The circular pharynx must now be replaced. Now remove the radial lobe: mark a flap 9 or 10.5 cm wide and 15 cm long on the left forearm. Also mark a skin monitor island. Successive cutting around the flap at the marked borders subfascially, the flap is finally lifted from all sides. Lifting is performed with the skin monitor including the superficial venous system. Exposure of the vascular pedicle after dissection of the brachioradialis muscle. Finally, distal placement of the flap on the radial artery and vein. Here, 4-0 prolene puncture ligation is performed on both sides. Successive lifting of the flap along its pedicle, taking the superficial venous system and the skin monitor with it. Outgoing vessels are successively clipped or bipolized. Exposure of the deep and superficial vascular pedicle in the crook of the elbow. The radial artery is placed in front of the interosseous artery and sutured over. Finally, the cephalic vein and a further medially larger outgoing vein are removed in the direction of the basilar vein. The superficial and deep venous systems are connected and have an outflow via these two veins. The most careful hemostasis was performed in the area of the flap before the vessels were removed. Subsequently, careful hemostasis was also performed in the area of the forearm. Successive closure of the forearm, primarily in the cranial area. Depending on the skin defect, 0.7 mm thick split skin is now removed using the dermatome. This is successively sutured into the forearm skin defect. Complete tension-free coverage of the skin defect on the forearm. A hydrocolloid lavanide-Mepilex dressing is then applied. Loosely placed swabs are placed over this. Wrap the forearm in absorbent cotton. Wrap an elastic bandage around the splint. The arm is then inserted. This is followed by the total pharyngeal set using the radial flap: successive suturing of the flap, initially caudally with 4-0 Vicryl single button sutures, paying strict attention to sufficient residual lumen thickness at the neopharyngo-oesophagial junction. Passage is finally easy to pass with the finger. The esophageal entrance is plastically widened in the sense of a continuous myotomy with mucosal transection. The appropriately shaped radial flap is now sutured into the incision. Successive suturing of the flap also from the cranial side with Vicryl 3-0 single button sutures, whereby a tension-free closure is achieved at the junction of the base of the tongue or tonsil lobe and radialis flap. Laterally, the radial lobe is sutured to itself. Over-sewing in the lateral area and also caudally and cranially at the transition to the base of the tongue in a second layer. The vessels on the sides of the neck are then conditioned. The left side of the neck is selected. The superior thyroid artery is selected. After conditioning the arteries, the radial artery is sutured end-to-end with the superior thyroid artery using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow and good venous return. This is followed by 2 venous anastomoses between the main outlets and the facial vein. After conditioning the vein, the smaller vein is first anastomosed using a 2/5 coupler and finally the larger vein is anastomosed using a 3/0 coupler. In each case, after opening the clamps, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. At the end, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The pedicle is now placed in such a way that kinking of the vessels is largely prevented. For this purpose, the skin monitor is placed in the middle over the flap. This is followed by extensive hemostasis of the entire wound area on both sides. Redon drainage on both sides. Repositioning of the apron flap. This is opened medially and the skin monitor is sutured in place without tension. Subsequent successive closure of the neck wounds in layers with epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Finally, insertion of a 10 mm tracheostomy tube which is fixed with sutures. Postoperatively, the patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue intraoperative antibiotic treatment with Unacid for 1 week. Please continue heparin perfusor with 500 E/hour for 5 days. Feeding via PEG tube for 10-12 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Check the flap clinically on the skin monitor and by Doppler according to the scheme for 5 days. Overall, cT4a cN2c hypopharyngeal carcinoma with invasion into the larynx and continuous growth into the soft tissues of the neck. Postoperative RCT is certainly indicated, but this should be discussed again in the interdisciplinary tumor conference in view of the concomitant diseases.","Complete pharyngectomy and laryngectomy

Then simultaneous start of elevation of the radial artery graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Marking of the radial artery, palpatory identification of the distal radial artery and the ulnar artery. Marking of the flap borders (9 x 5.5 cm) on the distal forearm proximal to the flexor retinaculum with an S-shaped incision extending proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue from the proximal side. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the graft margin. Identification of the external ramus, the superficial ramus, the radial nerve, protection of these. Exposure of the vascular pedicle between the flexor carpi radialis muscle and brachioradialis muscle, here dissection of the pedicle without damaging the vessel to be anastomosed. The incision is now made along the flap borders on the distal forearm. Elevation of the radial portion while leaving the fascia of the brachioradialis tendon intact. Subsequent dissection down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the forearm fascia of the graft edge up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendinous tissue on the flexor tendon and to protect the ulnar artery. Identification of the artery. Clamp the radial artery with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes under good pulsoxymetric oxygen saturation measured on the thumb (approx. 98%), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation with silk thread after the flap umbrella has already been completely detached from the support. Perforators were treated with a vessel clip. Bipolar coagulation. The radial nerve in the median side of the brachioradialis muscle remains intact. The brachial artery was exposed as well as the recurrent radial artery, ulnar artery, radial artery and interosseous artery; the radial artery was removed while preserving all of the above vessels and ligated using a silk thread. Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm and defect coverage of the graft with split skin from the right thigh in a typical manner with stitching of the split skin. Application of a wound dressing, forearm splint, completion of graft elevation without complications. This is followed by transoral tumor resection. The resection includes the anterior palatal arch and the lower 2/3 of the tonsil bed. It extends laterally up to the mandible and passes ventrally into the lateral base of the tongue and the base of the tongue to then extend over the adjacent hypopharynx and then also over the posterior wall of the hypopharynx. The submandibular gland is reached and visualized in depth. The specimen is marked and oriented accordingly on a cork plate before being sent in. In the frozen section histological examination, parts of CIS can still be found in the area of the posterior hypopharyngeal wall as well as in the area of the lateral resection margin in the area of the mandible/ transition to the palatal arch. Corresponding resections are performed here, which are then found to be tumor-free by frozen section histology. Overall, a defect of about 10 x 5 cm is created. The radial artery flap to be removed from the left forearm is the same size. Transition first to neck dissection on the left side. Here, regions I to V are removed while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. The tendon of the digastric muscle is then severed. Dissection of the superior thyroid artery first, which, however, proves to be of small caliber. The lingual and facial arteries are then dissected. Finally, the facial artery is removed from the mandible and beaten downwards and later used for anastomosis. Then create a passage into the oral cavity above the digastric muscle. Perform selective neck dissection of regions II to IV on the right side while preserving all lymphatic structures. There is no clinical evidence of lymph node metastasis on either side. After lifting the radial lobe graft, it is swung into the defect and sutured into the defect both transorally and transcervically. The facial artery is then anastomosed to the radial artery. Venous drainage is achieved through 2 veins at the end of the lateral anastomosis to the internal jugular vein. After completion of Redon wound drainage on both sides, the wound is closed in several layers. Finally, the patient is intubated with an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube. End of the operation, transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Transoral tumor resection of a tumor in the area of the glossotonsillar groove with defect coverage using a free radial flap graft from the left forearm, neck dissection on both sides, tracheostoma placement.","Resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy, PEG placement

It can be seen that it has been completely removed, but in the area of the posterior soft palate and the posterior palatal arch it is very scarce, so a resection is taken there and also in the area of the anterior palatal arch. The specimens are all thread-marked and sent for frozen section. Pathology cannot detect any tumor cells or carcinoma in situ in the marginal area and confirms that the carcinoma was resected in sano. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation and completion of the procedure. During the rapid incision break, a PEG was placed using the suture pull-through method with good diaphanoscopy. Please check the swallowing function postoperatively. In case of regurgitation, plan a radial flap as part of the neck dissection. A neck dissection must be performed on both sides for this carcinoma, only then can the patient be presented at the tumor conference.","Tumor resection, Free flap (Radial), PEG placement, Panendoscopy

Although there was initially no evidence of primary carcinoma, the follow-up ENT examination revealed tonsillar carcinoma. Sonographic evidence of cN2b neck status.","Firstly, inspection of the oral cavity: insertion of the tonsil plug and inspection of the tonsil region. On the left side, the tonsil is fissured with a small fibroma-like appendage. On the right side, the tonsil shows exophytic changes. A clear induration can be palpated, which extends to the lower tonsil pole. Macroscopically, a T2 tonsillar carcinoma is highly suspected. Then perform an enoral tumor resection: Resection of the tumor including the anterior palatal arch. Successive dissection of the tumorous mass with removal of the pharyngeal muscles; however, the posterior palatal arch can remain intact and is not infiltrated macroscopically or by palpation. Inclusion of the lower tonsil pole and a circumscribed area of the base of the tongue. The preparation is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. The fibroma-like appendage of the left tonsil is now removed. Enter with the small bore tube and re-inspect and re-inspect the hypopharynx and larynx. Here, inconspicuous conditions are seen in the region of the base of the tongue, the vallecula and the epiglottis, as well as inconspicuous conditions in the region of the hypopharynx with well-developed piriform sinuses, and the postcricoid region up to the esophageal opening is also clear. Adjustment of the endolarynx. Inconspicuous conditions here as well. The flexible esophagogastroscopy is then performed: easy to see through to the stomach. Inconspicuous conditions in the stomach area. Now, with excellent diaphanoscopy, insertion of a PEG tube. After a problem-free puncture of the stomach using the usual thread pull-through method. Inspection of the esophagus on reflection. Mucosal conditions are visible on all sides, but without any suspicious changes. The frozen section diagnosis now confirms the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. In the area of the medio-caudal marking, higher grade dysplasia is visible, otherwise the frozen section shows an R0 resection. A resection is now performed medio-caudally towards the base of the tongue and the posterior pharyngeal wall, extending to the vallecula. A final marginal sample covering the entire area is sent for frozen section diagnostics and later assessed as tumor-free. After resection, a barely covered, pulsating structure is found at the transition from the oropharynx to the hypopharynx, which could correspond to the internal carotid artery on Doppler sonography, but is otherwise located at the level of the exit of the lingual artery. Decision to explore as part of the neck dissection. In the case of dry enoral conditions, repositioning for neck dissection on both sides: injection with xylocaine and adrenaline. Start with the right side: To do this, make a skin incision by cutting around the previous scar submandibularly. Subcutaneous scarring in the area of the skin incision. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid after cutting through platysma remnants. A scar block extends into the depths in the area of the previous operation. Dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Then exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle and exposure up to the hyoid. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Pronounced scarring here too. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the facial vein. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve and successive removal of the anterior neck preparation. Pronounced scarring in the area of the anterior jugular vein. A clear tumorous mass is palpable caudal to the vein, which is located directly on the internal jugular vein and appears to infiltrate it palpatorily. A tumor cone also grows parallel to the vein cranially below the accessorius level. Further dissection of the vein. Pronounced scarring, but also clear evidence of tumor infiltration, so that the decision is made to resect the vein. Caudal exposure of the vein. Exposure of the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Removal of the vein after ligation and repositioning and cranial dissection. The mass infiltrates a few plexus branches. These are also resected. Now continue to expose the common carotid artery. Identification of the exit of the superior thyroid artery. Identification of the external and internal carotid artery. Cranial to the exit of the superior thyroid artery, a very strong vessel branches off and runs directly towards the resection area. Trace and visualize this vessel. In terms of caliber and localization, this vessel corresponds to the one seen enorally and is then removed after ligation and repositioning. Now successive dissection of the lymph node metastasis cranially. Cranial removal of the vein, also after ligation and repositioning. The accessor nerve can be spared. If there is significant scarring, there is infiltration of the tumor. Circumscribed with the sternocleidomastoid muscle, this is partially resected. The accessorius triangle has already been resected. Level Vb is now removed while carefully preserving the supraclavicular vessels. Final inspection and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure and turning to the opposite side: skin incision. Cut through subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma and creation of a platysmal flap. Exposure of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. These are spared (as on the opposite side). Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection and exposure of the accessorius nerve. Exposure and free preparation of the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Completing the dissection towards the hyoid. Exposure of the facial vein and preservation of the vein. Expose the digastric muscle posteriorly. Now successively expose the anterior neck preparation. Expose the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve as well as the cervical artery. Preservation of the structures. Further exposure of the facial vein and free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Cranial preparation. It can now be seen that the nervus accessorius runs behind the vein on this side. Careful protection. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and completion of level Va. If the wound is dry, irrigation of the wound and two-layer wound closure after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Now re-inspect enorally. Finally, meticulous hemostasis. The previously identified vessel can no longer be visualized by inspection and Doppler sonography. Now mucosal adaptation in the area of the vallecula and hypopharynx and, after final inspection, completion of the procedure. On the way to the recovery room, the patient can now be aspirated with fresh blood. In addition, saturation is only 90% with oxygen supply, so the patient is taken back to the operating room and reintubated. Re-inspection. A discrete, diffuse, venous hemorrhage is found, which is treated by meticulous hemostasis. Finally, absolutely dry wound conditions. Due to urgent indication by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and anesthesia, the patient is now tracheostomized. Repositioning of the patient. After infiltration anesthesia with xylocaine and the addition of adrenaline, a sparing, horizontal skin incision is made below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. An extremely thin thyroid isthmus is visible. This is bipolarly coagulated and severed. Further exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea and insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Performing a mucocutaneous anastomosis and subsequent problem-free reintubation to an 8-gauge tracheoflex cannula. Conclusion: At least cT2 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Performance of a modified radical neck dissection on the right with resection of the internal jugular vein and partial resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The patient should remain fasting for at least 3 to 5 days. After this, a diet should be started, initially with liquid food. Rapid decannulation should be aimed for. If possible, the first cannula should not be changed before the 4th postoperative day. Staging should also be supplemented during the further inpatient course. Due to the extent of the tumor, adjuvant therapy is certainly indicated.","Tonsillectomy, Neck dissection

According to the surgical report, it extended anteriorly to the anterior commissure, posteriorly it was clearly distinguishable from the vocal process and there was no infiltration in the morgue or subglottic sinus. In the interdisciplinary tumor conference, a partial laryngeal resection from the outside was indicated when the carcinoma made contact with the thyroid cartilage on computed tomography.","After induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues and intubation, entry with the Kleinsasser C-tube and inspection of the endolarynx. This reveals an extensive mass in the area of the left vocal fold, which macroscopically does not infiltrate the vocal process. The mass extends anteriorly to the anterior commissure and there is no infiltration into the subglottic region or into the depth of the morgue sinus. Now inject 10 ml of Ultracaine solution into a horizontal skin fold and cover sterilely. First make a skin incision approx. 5 cm long. Split the prelaryngeal muscles in the middle. Expose the thyroid cartilage plate and the ligamentum conicum. The ligamentum conicum is incised centrally with the monopolar. The perichondrium, the thyroid cartilage paramedian on the right, is then incised. Now mobilize the perichondrium on the thyroid cartilage plates laterally and perform a median chondrotomy and open up the larynx. The anterior commissure is now split paramedian on the right side in order to safely remove the tumor in a healthy state. Then incision parallel to the vocal fold in the area of the subglottic slope approx. 4 mm caudal to the glottic plane. Mobilization of the vocal fold, including the vocalis muscle in the anterior region. There is no palpable infiltration of the musculature here, so that the muscle is now largely left in place during posterior dissection. Now make another incision cranial to the morgue sinus with the scalpel parallel to the vocal fold plane so that the vocal fold is now completely mobilized from anterior to posterior up to the vocal process. Push off the mucosa medially from the vocal process and then remove the histological specimen, which is sent for final histology. Hemostasis in the area of the vocalis muscle with bipolar coagulation. A branch of the superior thyroid artery is also coagulated with bipolar coagulation. Now take marginal samples. Samples are taken from the right anterior commissure. A strip of mucosa from anterior to posterior is sent in for a frozen section both subglottically and supraglottically. Now take a marginal sample in the area of the medial arytenoid cartilage towards the posterior commissure. Mobilization of the pocket fold, which is now inserted caudally into the former anterior commissure and sutured to the subglottic mucosa. Initially, the entire surgical area is closed, but the intraoperative frozen section reveals an invasive carcinoma in the marginal sample of the arytenoid cartilage. Therefore, reopening of the larynx and case discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Decision to perform another mucosal resection in the area of the medial ary and posterior commissure and in the area of the cranial ary, which are sent for urgent histology. Resection of the arytenoid cartilage should initially be avoided due to the age of the patient and the resulting right prognosis with regard to aspiration. Now check for bloodlessness, which is present. Insertion of 2 drill holes each in the area of the thyroid cartilage plate. Adaptation of the thyroid cartilage plates using Vicryl 3-0. The ligamentum conicum is also closed and fixed to the thyroid cartilage plates through the drill hole. The mobilized perichondrium is also adapted as far as possible. Suturing of the prelaryngeal musculature after insertion of a flap. Subcutaneous and skin suturing and completion of the procedure. Conclusion: Intraoperative findings show a much more pronounced tumor extension towards the arytenoid cartilage than previously described in the panendoscopy. After removal of the tumor from the vocal process, the marginal specimen unfortunately still shows tumor growth. In a case discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, a resection is performed in the area of the medial arytenoid and a second resection in the area of the cranial arytenoid cartilage. These are sent for urgent histology. Resection of the arytenoid cartilage is not initially performed due to the patient's age and the associated increased risk of aspiration. If further tumor is detected in the post-resectate, laser resection of the arytenoid cartilage with the risk of a functionally necessary laryngectomy in the event of aspiration and radiotherapy as an alternative must be discussed with the patient.","Frontolateral partial laryngeal resection from the outside

Therefore, there is now an indication for transoral laser resection.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthetist, a microlaryngoscopy is performed first. Here the verrucous carcinoma of the entire left vocal fold can be confirmed. On the right, the findings are limited to the anterior third of the left vocal fold. Now setting with the Kleinsasser C-tube. Start resection with the CO2 laser at 3 watts in the posterior region, directly at the border with the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage. Then also partial resection of the pocket fold on the left side. The resection extends well into the subglottic area. Approximately 5 mm in front of the anterior commissure, the first part of the tumor preparation is resected. This is followed by repositioning with the Kleinsasser D-tube and removal of the remaining tumor up to the anterior commissure. The thyroid cartilage is resected from its inner side together with the perichondrium in this area. Hemostasis by means of monopolar coagulation, using the forceps and the suction cup. Now turn to the right side. Here there is a much less exophytic aspect, but more a restless mucosa, which is why a partial chordectomy is performed here, leaving parts of the ligament and the vocalis muscle intact. This extends approximately 8 mm posteriorly. After complete resection with the laser, the frozen section diagnosis is performed. Two strips are taken from the right side, one cranial and one caudal, and from the left side one anterior, one caudal and one posterior. A frozen section in the cranial region is not performed due to the resection of the pocket fold and the resulting large distance to the tumor. The frozen section diagnosis resulted in an R0 resection. After renewed careful hemostasis, the procedure is completed without bleeding and without complications. The patient should be presented at the tumor conference and undergo a follow-up microlaryngoscopy in 8 weeks. In addition, care should be taken to also perform a Dacron foil or Keel system in the event of synechiae of the anterior commissure.","Laser chordectomy left, Partial chordectomy right

First of all, the larynx was again positioned and the tumor inspected. Although the tumor extends to the left arytenoid cartilage, it appears to be resectable in principle via a frontolateral partial laryngectomy, despite the fact that hyposclerosis of the left arytenoid cartilage is detectable on CT. Preoperative detailed discussion with the patient. Then repositioning of the patient. Application of local anesthesia above the laryngeal framework. Abjode and cover the surgical area. Now zigzag skin incision in the median line. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Cut through the muscles. Exposure of the linea alba and the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of thyroid cartilage and ligamentum conicum. The patient has a large thyroid gland which extends to the cricoid cartilage. Based on this, expose the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus and ligation of both halves of the thyroid gland. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Now cut through the conic ligament. Opening of the larynx with the wheel The tumor can be seen in the area of the left vocal fold, which extends to the anterior commissure, but obviously does not spread to the right side. The patient is now intubated and a tube is inserted into the trachea. The tumor is then cut around with a clear safety margin at the level of the vocal folds into the morgue sinus. The subglottic slope is also resected. Now dissect in the direction of the arytenoid cartilage. The vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage is included in the resection and the tumor is removed in the area of the posterior commissure. Several marginal samples are then taken, particularly in the posterior part, all of which are found to be histologically free of tumor. Tissue is removed from the area of the anterior third of the vocal fold on the right, which is also found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. Now careful hemostasis. Closure of the larynx and suturing of a Keel to prevent synechiae. Insertion of a flap. Wound closure in layers and application of a pressure bandage. Completion of the procedure.

For this, insertion with the flexible gastroesophagoscope. Pre-viewing into the stomach. Then good diaphanoscopy. Insertion of the gastric tube using the thread pull-through method. This is successful without any problems. Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, then the tumor was inspected again with the Kleinsasser tube. The tumour is located in the hypopharynx on the lateral and anterior wall. It has a centrally deep ulcer, which is not accessible to the originally planned laser resection in any way, as the extension into the soft tissues of the neck cannot be determined and laser resection is therefore out of the question. Tracheotomy by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Palpation of the thyroid incisura, cricoid and jugulum as well as the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid and marking with a pen. Now mark the skin incision 3 transverse fingers above the jugulum, just below the cricoid cartilage. Make a horizontal incision along a skin fold, 7 cm long in total. Now enter with the 15 mm scalpel and sharply cut through the skin, the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. The anterior jugular vein is now exposed. This vein is dissected, clamped, ligated and cut. Further dissection in depth with exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. The linea alba is dissected and the musculature is displaced to the side. The thyroid capsule is now exposed and the Overholt clamp is used to enter between the isthmus and the cricoid cartilage. The isthmus is undercut and bipolarized, coagulated and severed. There is no relevant bleeding. Now both thyroid lobes are pushed to the side and incision is made with the pointed scissors between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage ring. Creation of a Björk flap. Tracheostomy suture with Ethibond. Re-intubation of the patient to a 9 mm cannula. No complications. Then sterile washing and draping. Now start with the apron flap and neck dissection on the left side. A 20 x 15 cm metastasis is seen here, which completely infiltrates the cervical vascular sheath and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Start with the dissection in the caudal area, here the sternocleidomastoid muscle is removed and the internal jugular vein is exposed, which is almost completely obliterated. Exposure of the common carotid artery from which the mass can still be pushed off in the deep part. This is very difficult as there is only a thin layer between the metastasis and the artery, which can, however, be dissected relatively well up to the bulb. The wall of the carotid artery is infiltrated in the area where the external carotid artery leaves, and the mass cannot be pushed off here. Further dissection in the cranial area. Separate the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the cranial region, then expose the obliterated internal jugular vein. This can also be removed. It is clear that the tumor is growing cranially to the base of the skull, then extremely laborious dissection of the metastasis from the base of the skull. This is finally successful. Now removal of the external carotid artery in the bulb area. However, the tumor must be left on the carotid artery, as it cannot be dissected off here. Removal of the entire metastasis. Now consult with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who recommends consulting a vascular surgeon with the question of a replacement graft. Now consult <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the vascular surgery department. He sees no problem with an end-to-end anastomosis. As the carotid artery is elongated due to the tumor displacement, the bulb area can be resected with a safety margin. Plaque removal is now performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and an end-to-end anastomosis is performed. Then transition to tumor resection. Entry into the pharynx from the lateral cranial side. Exposure of the tumor and resection of the tumor. The tumor grows clearly into the thyroid cartilage, so part of the thyroid cartilage is also removed. The superior laryngeal nerve must also be removed and the arytenoid on the left side can just be left standing. Now measure the defect and lift the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Neck dissection on the right by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: elevation of a platysma flap together with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Successive dissection of the platysma and flaps of the platysma flap cranially. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and dissection of the internal jugular vein, the common carotid artery, the bifurcation as well as the external and internal carotid artery. Exposure and sparing of the vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Displacement at the end of the operation. Re-embedding of the vagus and accessor nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the digaster venter posterior muscle. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and protection of the same. Displacement at the end of the operation. Re-embedding of the nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the right submandibular gland while protecting it. First develop the lateral neck preparation while sparing all the structures mentioned. The same applies to the median neck preparation. Postoperative careful hemostasis. During the operation, care was taken to preserve the venous and arterial connecting vessels. Elevation of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Drawing of the radialis graft on the distal forearm (6 x 10 cm) with additional monitor in the area of the flap pedicle. Demonstration on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Skin incision on the proximal forearm with incision around the skin monitor and the entire radialis graft. Subcutaneous preparation between radialis graft and skin monitor. Incision of the forearm fascia and exposure of the flexor tendons. Subfascial preparation of the radialis graft, initially from the ulnar side, with safe protection of the ulnar artery. Particular care is taken to leave the peritendineum attached to the tendon. Identification of the distal section of the radial artery with the comitant veins. Radial incision of the deep forearm fascia lateral to the cephalic vein. Reliable identification of the external ramus of the radial nerve. Separation of the radial artery on the distal forearm. Elevation of the graft with constant vascular ligation using vascular clips of the perforator vessels. Exposure of the confluence in the area of the proximal forearm/elbow. A good venous vascular network can be seen. Visualization of the exit of the radial artery from the brachial artery. Safe removal first of the radial artery and then of the venous vessels. Completion of graft elevation without complications. Suturing of the graft and anastomosis of the vessels, for this the superior thyroid artery is used on the right side, on the left side there are no vessels except for the bare carotid artery. Unfortunately, in the case of a previous operation, only the external jugular vein is available as a connecting vessel, which is also used. The defect is closed with split skin from the right thigh through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Inspection of the tendons for this. Some of these are very exposed and must be sutured over with muscle. Application of retaining sutures to reduce the defect. Adjustment of the split skin and suturing. Swabs are sutured onto areas where the split skin has no contact with the surface. At the end of the procedure, the skin is covered with a stretched compress and a dorsal forearm splint is applied. At the end, suture the skin monitor and insert a Redon drain on the left side and a flap on the right side. Insertion of the tracheostoma, two-layer wound closure and completion of the procedure without complications and good graft perfusion. In the meantime, the operation had to be interrupted several times as the patient developed a critical ventilation situation. This also necessitated an intraoperative bronchoscopy by the anesthesia colleagues. However, this did not reveal any pathological findings. Continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours, regular graft and wound checks according to the usual schedule. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. The patient's circulation is unstable and he is in a critical pulmonary situation that requires close monitoring.","Transcervical tumor resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Excision of part of the carotid artery by surgery

Subsequently intubation and pharyngoscopy as well as laryngoscopy with the Kleinsasser tube (C-tube). An exulcerated tumor measuring approx. 4 x 2 cm was found in the area of the edge of the tongue and floor of the mouth on the left, from which a biopsy was taken for frozen section diagnosis. In addition, there is a leukoplakia behind the last molar on the left alveolar ridge of the mandible. The left tonsil also shows a discrete lesion, which is also biopsied. The previously described leukoplakia is removed by excisional biopsy. This is followed by esophagogastroscopy with a flexible instrument and placement of a PEG. After PEG placement without complications, enoral tumor resection is performed. Now the tumor is gradually bypassed with the monopolar needle at a macroscopic safety distance of 1 cm. As soon as the deep soft tissue gives way, a corresponding safety distance is maintained. The tumor extends from the anterior third of the tongue on the left over the entire dorsal edge of the tongue to approx. 1-2 cm into the base of the tongue. The tumor also reaches the glossotonsillar groove. After carefully moving around the tumor with the monopolar and removing the resected specimen, it is marked and sent for frozen section diagnostics. Neck dissection follows on the left side with a submandibular skin incision approx. 2 QF below the mandible and, after appropriate skin incision, preparation of the cranial and caudal platysmal flaps. Sparing of the external jugular vein and the auricularis magnus nerve. Dissection of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle up to the vascular nerve sheath. Dissection along the omohyoid muscle to the hyoid bone and along the diagstricus muscle to the laterobasis. Dissection along the internal jugular vein after previous exposure and securing of the accessorius nerve. Lifting of the level II, III and IV neck block while sparing all nerves and vascular structures. This is followed by the removal of level V with protection of the accessorius nerve, the cervical accessorius plexus and the cervical plexus. Enlarged lymph nodes are particularly evident in the area of level II. Level Va also shows enlarged lymph nodes in the cranial area. After careful removal of the corresponding regions, the submandibular gland is dissected and removed. The surrounding lymph nodes of region Ib are also carefully removed. Care is taken to protect the marginal ramus and facial nerve. Finally, the ligation of the lingual artery is performed due to the extensive partial resection of the enoral tongue. Irrigation of the wound, careful hemostasis and insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Suturing of the platysma, subcutaneous sutures and skin sutures. After the frozen section has revealed submucosal carcinoma infiltrates, the corresponding areas are resected again and final margin samples are taken. These final margin samples now reveal a carcinoma-free finding in the frozen section diagnosis. Once again, careful hemostasis is carried out before a tracheostomy is performed due to the extensive resection area, the associated risk of swelling and bleeding and the predicted difficulty in swallowing. This involves a jugular skin incision and dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and prelaryngeal muscles. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Undercutting of the isthmus and careful coagulation of the isthmus. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea, creation of a caudally pedicled suture in the sense of a Björk flap. Suturing of the Björk flap with 2 fixation sutures and a cranial suture of the stoma. Lateral skin sutures. Transfer to an 8-gauge Rüsch cannula with blocking. Sterile wound dressing.","Partial resection of tongue and floor of mouth on the left, Neck dissection, Tracheostomy, PEG, Panendoscopy

After a decision in the tumor conference and consultation with the patient and her caregiver, recommendation for surgical therapy. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues transnasally. Then start of the tumor resection from the transoral side. Insertion of a tonsil plug and inspection of the oropharynx and oral cavity. A relatively fresh lesion with irregular mucosal changes is found in the area of the uvula. As it cannot be guaranteed whether this lesion existed previously or was caused by the intubation, a biopsy is taken and sent for a frozen section. No evidence of dysplasia or invasive carcinoma in the frozen section. Therefore, start with tumor resection. The tumor extends onto the soft palate and moves along the alveolar ridge of the mandible into the tonsil region, infiltrates and completely consumes the tonsil, continues down the lateral wall of the oropharynx on the left and spreads to the base of the tongue here, infiltrates the base of the tongue on the right side, merges into the vallecula. The epiglottis is free. Now start with the tumor resection in the area of the soft palate, here macroscopic safety distance approx. 1 cm. The tumor is cut around with the monopolar needle. The tumor resection is now extended to the alveolar ridge. The tumor also infiltrates the posterior palatal arch. This is removed as well as part of the pharynx. The area of the cervical fat is reached relatively quickly and since the overview in the caudal area is no longer given, the tumor is now washed and covered sterilely in order to continue the tumor resection later from the transcervical area. Now make a skin incision at the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Here you can already see large metastases in level II. Visualization of the omohyoid muscle, visualization of the cervical vascular sheath. It is clear that the internal jugular vein is infiltrated by a large metastasis at level III, so the internal jugular vein is removed below this metastasis. The neck levels IIa to Va are then cleared out, sparing the plexus branches. The neck levels are sent separately for histology as part of the lymph node study. Level Ia and b are then evacuated with removal of the submandibular gland and transection of the digastric and stylohyoid muscles. Level I also contains conspicuous nodes, which are all removed. A breakthrough is now created enorally and the tumor is removed via this breakthrough using the pull-through technique. Marginal samples are taken from the tumor specimen itself and sent for frozen section; all marginal samples are tumor-free. This means that the tumor itself is removed from the R0 specimen. Now measure the defect and move on to the radialis graft. Start by elevating the radialis graft with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, then continue with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, at the same time carry out the neck dissection on the right side with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, here also making a skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the platysma, exposure of the omohyoid and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and clearing of the neck levels IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Here too, the neck levels are sent in individually as part of the lymph node study. The vascular situation here is also relatively poor. There is only a tiny superior thyroid artery, which is not suitable for subsequent connection to the radial artery. The lingual artery cannot be removed as it had to be resected on the left side as part of the tumor resection. The ascending pharyngeal artery is so small that it is also not available as a flap vessel. Only a very small facial artery would be possible. There is also only one vein available as a venous connecting vessel, namely the facial vein, which is also very thin. Dictation of the radial artery flap. Marking of the graft 14 x 6 x 6 cm is configured so that both the pharyngeal and soft palate defect can be covered, as well as the tongue base defect. Incision of the graft. Incision in the proximal area of the forearm. Then exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the superficial fascia of the radial nerve, which can be completely spared with its branches. Exposure of the radial artery. Clamping, ligation and ligation of the radial artery, then lifting of the radialis graft from the tendon bed. The ulnar artery is palpable in depth. Pulse oximetry on the index finger shows a continuous good blood supply to the hand, even after the radial artery has been removed. Then dissection of the pedicle up to the elbow. This shows an anatomical variation, so that the radial artery is dissected further up into the upper arm area and can only be removed at its high exit. Two venous vessels are also elevated, both of which belong to the superficial system, but a very good confluence between the superficial and deep venous system can also be elevated. The radialis graft is then removed. It can now be seen that one superficial vein has no venous return flow and the second vein only has a weak return flow. Overall, it can be seen that the entire radial artery is also in a very poor condition in terms of the endothelium. Nevertheless, there is no further possibility of lifting another graft. This graft must be used. This is also due to the fact that the left side is not available as a graft in the absence of sufficient perfusion in the radial artery area and the AED is also not suitable for use in the case of severe obesity. Suturing the graft first from the transoral side and then later from the transoral side is again difficult due to swelling. Sutures must therefore be placed in the caudal area and the graft retracted. Now create an opening from the cervical left to the cervical right. The stalk is then transferred to the right side. Dissect the facial artery as the connecting vessel and the facial vein. Then first suture the arterial anastomosis. Good flap perfusion at the beginning. However, the venous return flow is then interrupted so that the entire arterial anastomosis has to be sutured again. This condition then occurs again, so that up to a third anastomosis must be made in the arterial limb. For this, large sections of the radial artery have to be cut back and also the facial artery due to the very poor vascular condition in the vessel itself, there are endothelial-like deposits both in the neck and in the radial artery, some of which are calcareous, which makes suturing the anastomosis considerably more difficult. Ultimately, good flap perfusion can be maintained over a longer period of time with an albeit limited, moderate venous return flow. The facial vein is now connected to the one remaining flap vein using a coupler. Due to an unfavorable flap situation, this has to be repeated so that ultimately extremely difficult conditions exist in the anastomosis area, but a stable anastomosis could be created at the end of the operation. Due to the special situation, the patient was given 500 E/h heparin intraoperatively, which was to continue for 5 days. At the end, a flap was inserted on the right side and a Redon drainage on the left side. Prior to this, a tracheotomy was performed in the usual manner and the neck was closed in two layers. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation. Continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours, preferably for 3 days. Then 5 days heparin 500 E/h, for 2 days please 2-hourly flap controls, then continue according to the usual scheme and present the patient to the tumor conference after receiving the histology.","Resection, Neck dissection, Panendoscopy, Free flap coverage (Radial)

This is located at the arytenoid fold medially, reaching the arytenoid cartilage and in the piriform sinus anteriorly and at the lateral border. The above-mentioned surgery is therefore indicated and flap coverage is also planned if necessary.","First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again, tumour localization and extent confirmed. PEG insertion: Careful insertion of the flexible instrument into the stomach. Identification of the anterior wall of the stomach and observation of a positive diaphanoscopy. Abdominal wall puncture and PEG insertion in the usual manner using the suture pull-through method without complications. Subsequent repositioning for neck dissection on both sides and laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy on the left. Apposition of the apron flap in the typical manner. Neck dissection on the right side and release of the larynx, tracheotomy and performance of the myotomy: repositioning of the patient for laryngectomy in the head reclination position. Injection of Suprarenin in the area of the skin incision (apron flap). Sterile wiping and draping of the patient. Start the operation by making a skin incision on both sides of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to below the cricoid (apron flap). Separation of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue and subplatysmal flap elevation. After exposing the hyoid bone and the submandibular glandulae on both sides, the apron flap is sutured cranially. Transition to neck dissection on the right side by exposing the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and sharp dissection down to the depths until the deep plexus branches become visible. Identification of the accessorius nerve and removal of the nerve from the neck preparation. Exposure of the posterior venter of the digastric muscle at the cranial end of the neck and dissection along the muscle to the hyoid bone. Now identification of the omohyoid muscle and dissection along the muscle also up to the hyoid bone. Insertion of the caudal retractor and exposure of the cervical vascular nerve sheath. The neck preparation is dissected free to the cervical vascular nerve sheath and removed from cranial to caudal in the usual manner while protecting the vascular and nerve structures. No suspicious nodules are detected during dissection. Identification of the carotid bifurcation and visualization of the superior thyroid artery. Separation of the superior thyroid artery close to the larynx. Separation of the infrahyoid muscles at the hyoid bone and dissection of the muscles caudally. Skeletonize the larynx in the usual manner. At the caudal end, remove and free the thyroid gland from the cricoid cartilage and the trachea. Now expose the thyroid isthmus, undermine the isthmus and cut the isthmus after bipolar coagulation. Entry into the trachea after saturation of the patient in the 2nd to 3rd intratracheal space. Re-intubation and suturing of the tracheostoma in the caudal region. Radical neck dissection on the left: A large lymph node or lymph node conglomerate is visible cranially, which extends to the large vessels. Successive dissection of the node away from the adjacent, neighboring structures. This is initially carried out cranially, taking the digastric muscle and the hypoglossal nerve with it, which run directly into the lymph node conglomerate. The accessor nerve and the cranial insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle are also resected cranially. Exposure of the vessels from the medial side. The facial vein is ligated. The internal jugular vein is also removed caudally and ligated twice caudally. Further dissection of the conglomerate cranially along the common carotid artery, later internally and externally. The bifurcation is dissected, here the tumor reaches directly, but it is possible to dissect a layer of adventitia and thus completely dissect the tumor from the internal carotid artery and out of the bifurcation. Further cranial infiltration of the externa. This is therefore removed shortly after the bifurcation and treated here using 4-0 prolene sutures. The external carotid artery is also removed cranially. The internal jugular vein is also removed, which is ligated twice cranially. The vagus nerve can also be dissected straight from the tumor, there is no direct tumor infiltration here, it can be dissected bluntly. Several branches of the cervical plexus must also be resected. The sternocleidomastoid muscle must also be removed caudally. The accessorius nerve is also removed. After removal of the main lymph node conglomerate, further neck dissection, ultimately level II to V. This involves partial preservation of the branches of the cervical plexus. Phrenic nerve preserved. Also border cord. Subsequent irrigation of the wound area and hemostasis. Laryngectomy follows: dissection of the suprahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone. Also dissection of the infrahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone, which is cut caudally. Skeletonization of the larynx on the right side, exposing the superior cornu. Detachment of the constrictor pharyngis muscle. Dissection of the thyroid glands latero-caudally on both sides. Separation of the isthmus here. Subsequent creation of a tracheotomy and insertion of a laryngectomy tube after reintubation. Then cranial exposure of the epiglottis from the outside. The epiglottis is isolated with maximum preservation of the mucosa. You now have a good view of the tumor. The tumor is resected with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm on all sides on the left side of the pharynx. Maximum preservation of the mucosa on the right side. Subsequent release of the larynx in the area of the pharyngoesophageal junction. Then separation of the larynx from the trachea in a typical manner. Marking of the tumor specimen using sutures. To be on the safe side, a marginal sample is taken from the hypopharynx on the left from the area of the transition to the postcricoid up to the transition to the base of the tongue and is also marked with sutures for the frozen section. Overall, all specimens together indicate an R0 situation. The left myotomy now follows. The constrictor pharyngis muscle on the left side is successively severed up to the mucosa to facilitate passage through the pharyngoesophageal junction. Provox prosthesis insertion is then carried out by inserting an 8 mm prosthesis, which is inserted without complications and in a typical manner. Subsequent closure of the pharynx, which is easily possible in the first instance, by means of an inverting layer using 4-0 Vicryl single button sutures. A further layer of inverting sutures, also with 4-0 Vicryl single button sutures, is placed on top. A third layer can be applied cranially, but this must be omitted in the area of the pharyngeal tube due to the hypopharyngeal resection, which also involved the muscular wall. Caudally, the musculature of the omohyoid muscle is still sutured via the pharyngoesophageal junction, as is the thyroid gland. The wound area is then irrigated again and the bleeding stopped. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain on both sides and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Insertion of a 9 mm tracheostomy tube at the end. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Overall cT2-3 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the left. No larynx-preserving therapy indicated due to the overall situation and the expected dysphagia in the patient's condition, in particular the presence of COPD. Postoperative nutrition via the inserted gastric tube or PEG tube. This for 7 to 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, dietary support. Due to the large mass on the left, postoperative RCT is certainly indicated adjuvantly. Tumor could be easily removed from the common carotid artery or bifurcation and interna after pushing off with the adventitia. Nonetheless, the lymph node conglomerate was also present on the internal carotid artery for a long time.

This is not successful in the absence of diaphanoscopy, so a nasogastric feeding tube is inserted via the left nostril. Then insertion of the T-barrier and start of transoral tumor resection with the ultrasonic knife. The soft palate is resected almost completely on the right side. The resection then extends caudally on the posterior wall of the hypopharynx approximately in the median line. Laterally, pterygoid muscles and the fatty tissue of the soft tissues of the neck are reached. The tumor can thus be dissected out successively with an appropriate safety margin up to the glossotonsillar groove and at the base of the tongue and finally removed. Inspection of the specimen after removal. A muscular cuff is still present at the base of the tumor, but slightly less than at the edges. Therefore, a resection is performed from the muscles at the corresponding site. Samples are then taken from the margins around the defect. All histologies are examined using frozen section histology and are found to be tumor-free, including the main specimen. Subsequently, transition to neck dissection on the right side. The anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is skeletonized after a skin incision. Then skeletonize the digastric muscle and successively remove regions II to V while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. There is no indication of a suspicious lymph node. Subsequent evacuation of regions Ia and Ib including submandibulectomy. The defect is completed in the pharyngeal direction. The lingual nerve and the hypoglossal nerve are exposed and can be spared. Dissection of the superior thyroid vein for the subsequent anastomosis. Subsequent transition to the opposite side. Here, regions II to V are dissected in the usual way, preserving all non-lymphatic structures. Here too, there is no clinical evidence of a suspicious lymph node. Insertion of a Redon suction drain on the left side and two-layer wound closure in the usual manner. In the meantime, start lifting the radial lobe graft from the left forearm. The defect measures approximately 11 x 7.5 cm. After an S-shaped skin incision, the superficial vein is dissected distally. The two muscle bellies are then pushed apart with identification of the underlying vascular pedicle. This is dissected circularly. The flap is then first incised ulnarly down to the fascia and dissected radially down to the tendon of the flexor carpi muscle. Similarly, the flap is dissected radially while sparing the sensitive nerve. The pedicle and the entire flap are then detached from its base. The confluence is then dissected cranially, exposing the exit of the radial artery and dissecting two superficial veins beyond the antecubital fossa. The radial artery flap graft was then removed. In the meantime, the split-thickness skin was removed from the right thigh. This is then used to cover the defect on the left forearm. Now insertion of the radialis graft into the oropharyngeal defect. The graft is sutured into the defect transorally, whereby the cranial part is doubled in the area of the soft palate. The graft is then sutured caudally close to the base of the tongue. However, the last 5 sutures are performed transcervically from the right. The arterial anastomosis of the radial artery to the superior thyroid artery is then performed. The two veins of the left arm are then connected to the internal jugular vein using an end-to-side technique. Then carefully stop some bleeding from the flap until the blood is dry. Previously a Redon suction drainage into the right side of the neck. Insertion of an Easy flow drainage. Checking the patency of the venous anastomoses. Two-layer wound closure. In addition, the tracheostomy was performed between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Finally, after completion of the operation, sterile neck dressing and reintubation of the patient on a 9-gauge tracheostomy tube. Conclusion: Transoral resection of a tonsillar carcinoma on the right side and selective neck dissection on both sides with preservation of all non-lymphatic structures. Right oropharyngeal defect coverage with a radial flap graft from the left forearm. Defect coverage on the left forearm with split skin from the right thigh. Additional tracheotomy performed. Unsuccessful attempt to insert a PEG in the absence of a diaphanoscopy.","Transoral resection, Selective bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Preoperative CT showed a cT1 cN0 cM0 uvula/oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left side. Sonography also showed a cN0 neck status. There is now an indication for panendoscopy and tumor resection. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carry out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesiologist. Induction of anesthesia. Transition to tracheoscopy: problem-free passage of the non-irritated glottis and endotracheal entry. Mucosal conditions are normal on all sides up to the tracheal bifurcation. Intubation of the patient. Transition to esophagogastroscopy: insertion of the endoscope under visualization and constant air insufflation into the stomach. Insufflation of the same. This reveals a typical gastric mucosal relief without irritation on all sides. Occasionally, small, broad-based polyps can be seen in the area of the large curvature. Inversion and inspection of the gastroesophageal junction. This appears to be altered in a reflux-like manner. After desufflation, slow withdrawal of the endoscope with circular inspection of all sections of the esophagus. This reveals leukoplakic-like changes to the mucosa, particularly in the distal and cervical sections, which cannot be flushed away. Both the gastric polyps and the esophageal findings should be checked gastroenterologically at intervals. Then insert the mouth guard and enter with the size C small bore tube. Adjustment of the endolarynx. Mucosal conditions are normal on all sides. Enter the piriform sinus on both sides. This is lined with smooth mucosa on all sides and can be seen freely up to the tip of the piriform sinus. There is also no evidence of a tumor postcricoidally or in the area of the esophageal opening. Adjustment of the findings described above using the McIvor oral spatula. This shows the exophytically growing mass in the area of the left soft palate. The main tumor mass appears to be localized on the posterior surface of the velum. Medially, the tumor growth extends over the posterior surface across the base of the uvula to the opposite right side, where it only reaches the anterior palatal arch. Laterally to the left, the tumor extends macroscopically to the upper tonsil pole. Velotractio is applied in the typical manner and the posterior surface of the velum is inspected. The tubes appear free on both sides. The tumor does not extend very far cranially on the posterior surface of the velum. Hence the decision to resect the tumor. As the tumor grows macroscopically on the posterior surface of the uvula to the opposite right side, the decision is made to resect the uvula completely. Starting parauvularly on the right and resection of the tumor with an electric needle and pointed scissors. The tumor can thus be exposed well and resected macroscopically in sano. In the area of the anterior palatal arch on the left side, a resection specimen is taken with macroscopically close in sano resection. The main specimen is thread-marked at the corresponding site. A biopsy is also taken in the area of the left caudal tonsil lobe. The mucosa here also appears to be leukoplakically altered. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation and insertion of H2O2-soaked ball swabs. If the wound bed is dry, the operation is completed without complications. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist. Due to the growth crossing the midline, a neck dissection should be planned on both sides during the inpatient stay. The placement of a PEG feeding tube was deliberately avoided for the time being.","Transoral tumor resection, Panendoscopy

The patient was also found to have CLL with manifestations in the vallecula area. However, no further measures were required here. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment was indicated. Preoperative sonography revealed a neck status of at least cN2b on the left side with conspicuous nodules in level Ia. After radial artery harvesting in the area of the left forearm, there were limited possibilities for graft harvesting.","After intubation by the anesthesia colleagues and preparation for the procedure, pharyngoscopy is performed to determine the extent of the mass. An exophytic mass was found in the area of the left tonsillar lobe. Infiltration of the anterior and posterior palatal arch. Growth over the glossotonsillar groove into the edge and base of the tongue with palpatory submucosal growth towards the posterior floor of the mouth, overall cT3, therefore primarily transoral resection. Incision of the tumor with a safety margin of a good 1 cm, including the anterior and posterior palatal arch. Resection in a parauvular direction. In the case of deep infiltration, expose the pterygoid muscles. Inclusion of the posterior palatal arch and here also the muscles basally here in sano. Resection up to the alveolar ridge, here small tumor extension, therefore circumscribed bone exposure in the area of the posterior mandible. Detachment of the periosteum here. Now resection towards the posterior floor of the mouth, here the tongue shows submucosal infiltration at the edge and base of the tongue. Resect the base of the tongue generously while maintaining a safety distance of at least 1.5 cm. Release of the tongue section. It is now apparent that the tumor has grown submucosally over the posterior floor of the mouth towards the cervical region, with insufficient control, so that the combined procedure via a transcervical approach is now decided upon. Imaging of the entire enoral tumor in the area of the mucosal margins as well as basally with margin samples, these are diagnosed as completely tumor-free. Then turn to the transcervical approach. Skin incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A rough, hard mass can be palpated in depth at the cranial edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The same applies to levels II and Ia. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose and dissect the platysma. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery and the superior thyroid vein, which is very strong here. Cranial dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle shows clear infiltration. Therefore, the muscle is removed at the level of the omohyoid muscle, cranial dissection with the neck preparation up to level Vb with numerous nodes, targeted ligation of the thoracic duct. After visualization, no evidence of lymphatic leakage. Cranial dissection, caudal preservation of the cervical plexus. Cranially, the metastasis is markedly coarse and hard to palpate, firmly infiltrating the surrounding tissue. Involvement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle up to its cranial origin. Involvement of paravertebral musculature. Resection of the accessorius nerve with parts of the cervical plexus. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, which is clearly infiltrated cranially. Retention of the outlet of the superior thyroid vein. In the case of extensive perinodally growing metastasis or soft tissue metastasis, the .............. The internal jugular vein as well as the vagus nerve, the carotid bulb and the branches of the external and internal carotid arteries are also surrounded by tumors. Clear infiltration of the hypoglossal nerve. Careful dissection of the common carotid artery and the carotid bulb with dissection of the perivascular tissue allows the tumor to be removed in toto from the carotid bulb and the internal carotid artery. No wall infiltration, but long-lasting involvement of the internal carotid artery. With removal of the entire perivascular tissue and resection of the structures already described as well as resection of the caudal parotid pole, a mass can now be resected in toto. Resection, the mass moves under the digastric muscle in the direction of the tonsillar lobe. Now there is no complete tumor growth, so that a direct metastatic pathway is present. Tumor infiltration towards the muscles of the floor of the mouth is now also evident. Palpation from the outside through the primary tumor initially leads to resection of the digastric muscle, triggering of the submandibular gland, here in level Ib multiple and macroscopically highly visible masses, which are excised in toto. Exposure of the long marginal mandibular ramus, which is not infiltrated and can be preserved. Resection of the submandibular gland. Here, creation of the connection inwards to the enoral transresection margin. Final resection of the primary tumor, including the floor of the mouth, muscles and lateral pharyngeal muscles. Here in toto on all sides. A complete image of the tumor and the basal musculature is now made at the caudal site of the base of the tongue and the caudal pharyngeal wall; these are also diagnosed as completely tumor-free in the frozen section diagnosis. Overall, an R0 situation can be assumed here as far as it can be imaged using marginal samples. The anterior excision of level Ib and the excision of level Ia are now performed. Level Ia shows a highly suspicious lymph node and a further soft tissue metastasis. Release under resection of the anterior venter of the digastric muscle, resection of the metastasis with surrounding and floor muscles but without infiltration. After enoral complete evacuation of level Ia. Careful inspection of the wound area. Overall dry conditions. The lingual artery was removed. Likewise, outlets of the facial artery, otherwise existing arterial supply and existing caudal internal jugular vein with ultimately remaining tributaries of the superior thyroid and middle thyroid vein. Subsequently, parallel neck dissection of the right side and elevation of the antero-lateral thigh graft from the right after measurement of the defect and confirmation of the R0 situation. First to the neck dissection on the right. This also involves a curved incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomatoid muscle, cutting through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid and omohyoid muscles. Exposure of the submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical vein, the facial vein, the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, clearing of the accessorius triangle and clearing of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. In level II, conspicuous nodes also paraglandular in the area of the submandibular gland, several nodes clearly suspicious in number and size. Release of the submandibular gland. Clearing of level Ib, exposure of the marginal mandibular ridge and careful protection of the nerve. Complete evacuation of level Ib, macroscopically highly conspicuous nodes in number and size. Complete the dissection to level Ia. Finally, extensive wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Then turn to the plastic tracheotomy: To do this, make a horizontal skin incision approx. 1 cm below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Ligation of the left-sided anterior jugular vein. Entering the linea alba, exposing the cricoid cartilage, exposing the anterior wall of the trachea. Dissection of the slender thyroid isthmus. Further exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap. Subsequent successive insertion of the tracheostoma. Subsequent problem-free intubation onto a size 9 low cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. Now to lift the anterolateral thigh graft. After marking the landmarks, double sonographic identification of the main perforator and 2 secondary perforators. Marking of the graft configured for the tonsil lobe, pharyngeal side wall and tongue, measuring approx. 11 x 9 cm in total. Medial incision. Separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue, exposure of the facia lata, reliable identification of the rectus femoris muscle, strictly subfascial preparation. Visualization of the pedicle vessel. Inspection reveals the sonographically visualized perforators which, however, are extremely slender. Execution of the relief incision and further exposure of the pedicle vessel. Complete resection of the graft, including the fascia lata. In the case of a circumscribed myocutaneous course of the perforators, a narrow muscle strip is removed after identification of the distal vascular pedicle. After identification of the perforator level, elevation of the graft, isolation on the vascular pedicle. Dissection of the vascular pedicle, visualization of a venous confluence. Exposure of the transverse ramus. Subsequently, if the graft is in proper vitality, the graft is removed after ligation of the feeding and draining vessels. Careful wound inspection and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drainage and then careful multi-layer wound closure with smoothing of excess skin. The combined transoral and transcervical insertion of the graft is now performed. Overall extremely good fit and intact conditions on all sides. Reconstruction of the soft palate, the tonsil lobe, the pharyngeal side wall and the base and edge of the tongue, as well as the posterior floor of the mouth. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery and the superior thyroid vein. Perform the arterial anastomosis using the single suture technique with 8-0 Ethilon. This succeeds immediately without any problems. Regular venous return and vital graft. Performing the venous anastomosis with the coupler system using a size 3.5 coupler. Finally, regular circulation, good pedicle pulsation as well as a positive smear test and a regularly vital graft enorally, so that after a final wound inspection a 10 redon drain is inserted and the wound is carefully closed in two layers. During the recovery phase, a moderate degree of ballooning of the neck becomes apparent if the right Redon drainage is not pumped, so re-exploration is performed at the end. Removal of the hematoma, hemostasis in the area of smaller muscle vessels, careful wound irrigation with H202 and Ringer's solution and, if the wound was absolutely dry, re-insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure and completion of the procedure with a vital graft. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with clindamycin 600 mg, which should be continued for 24 hours postoperatively. If possible, leave the suture-fixed cannula in place for 5 days postoperatively. Carry out an X-ray pre-swallow on the 10th postoperative day, then evaluate the swallowing function. Due to the radical tumor resection and the extended radical neck dissection on the left with resection of the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve, a protracted recovery of swallowing function can be expected here.

Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery is now indicated. Another endoscopic examination was indicated to clarify the question of whether laser resection is possible or an external approach. Patient was also informed about defect coverage by means of flap plasty.","Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. Pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: insertion of the size B small bore tube. A small exulcerated tumor can be seen in the area of the anterior piriform sinus wall up to the border of the lateral wall. However, this shows a deep ulcer, so that a risk-free laser resection ultimately does not appear to be possible with pulsations on the lateral wall. The decision was therefore made to proceed transcervically. Initial PEG insertion: insertion with the flexible esophagoscope. Advance into the stomach. After creating the diaphanoscopy and sterile covering of the abdomen, insertion of an abdominal wall probe using a typical technique in a typical manner. Sterile fixation to the abdominal wall. Repositioning for neck dissection and tumor resection. The patient is also prepared for radial lobectomy. Therefore, all relevant surgical areas are covered. Injection of Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline 10 ml into both sides of the neck. Start with neck dissection level II to V on the right: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the digastric and omohyoid muscles and the infrahyoid muscles. Dissection of the fat-lymph node package. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein. Exposure of the internal/external carotid artery, superior thyroid artery and facial artery. Exposure, displacement and at the end of the operation re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, branches of the cervical plexus and the border cord in the sense of a neurolysis. Lymph nodes are firmly attached to the vessels in the upper area, but can be dissected, even in depth, and dissected from the border cord. Level II to V dissection is performed while preserving all structures. Neck dissection on the left: This is performed in the same way as on the opposite side. Here too, all structures are preserved as on the opposite side. Then tumor resection: Exposure of the hyoid bone, which is also resected laterally. Exposure and resection of the upper horn of the larynx. Mobilization of the pharyngeal tube. Entering the pharynx just below the hyoid bone at the level of the epiglottis. The tumor can be visualized. This is resected with a safety margin of at least 1 cm on all sides, macroscopically in healthy tissue. Resection includes the anterior piriform sinus and parts of the lateral wall. As the tumor has its deepest ulcer basally in the direction of the thyroid cartilage, the lateral thyroid cartilage is also resected and is attached basally to the specimen. The superior laryngeal nerve can also not be preserved in direct contact with the tumor. The specimen is then marked with sutures and sent in. In addition, a marginal sample is taken from the medial area. A strip is taken from the area of the arytenoid fold down to the piriform sinus. The frozen section shows that the tumor has been removed from the healthy area. However, carcinoma in situ can still be seen in some places in the medially removed marginal sample. A further resection is recommended here. Therefore, another resection of an almost 1 cm wide mucosal strip from the area of the arytenoid fold is performed, whereby the border to the postcricoid area is already reached. The frozen section still shows very clear carcinoma in situ infiltrates in most areas with a transition to microinvasive carcinoma in some places. Based on the overall situation, field carcinomatization can now be assumed in the entire hypopharyngeal region. At the very least, this cannot be ruled out. A further resection in the direction of the postcricoid area would in any case be accompanied by significant dysphagia and possibly necessitate a laryngectomy. However, this was not discussed in detail with the patient in advance. Therefore, the decision was made not to perform a further resection. The pharynx is closed using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures, whereby the mucosa is closed directly in the lower area to the piriform sinus, and in the upper area the mucosa is sutured to the inside of the residual thyroid cartilage. In the upper area, the mucosa is sutured again. Pharyngeal muscles are stitched over this and sutured around the thyroid cartilage to the infrahyoid muscles, suprahyoid muscles or hyoid bone. This results in a stable closure. Extensive irrigation of the entire surgical area. Careful hemostasis. Layered closure of the wound on the left with insertion of a Redon drain, on the right with insertion of two Redon drains. Application of a wound and pressure dressing on both sides. Creation of a tracheotomy: Subcutaneous tissue is prepared via a Kocher collar incision in the typical manner, veins are ligated. The thyroid isthmus is then severed. Exposure of the trachea. Thyroid isthmus is cut off. The trachea is opened like a visor flap at the typical location and an epithelialized tracheostoma is created. Finally, an 8 mm tracheal cannula is inserted after removal of the laryngectomy tube. Application of a wound dressing. Subsequent completion of the procedure without complications. Final consultation with the anesthesia department. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Here, please continue the antibiotic treatment that was started preoperatively with Unacid for a further week. Nutrition via the inserted PEG tube. Wait for the final histology. According to the current state of knowledge, field carcinomatization is present, particularly in the direction of the postcricoid area, which would ultimately necessitate a laryngectomy in the event of surgical treatment. However, due to the still microinvasive carcinoma parts, postoperative radiochemotherapy should also be discussed.","Resection transversely through the neck, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement

Therefore, indication for laryngoscopy for the purpose of planning further measures.","First, induction of anesthesia and transoral endotracheal intubation by the anesthesia colleagues and positioning of the patient by the surgeon. Laryngoscopy is performed using the Kleinsasser C-tube. Adjustment of the endolaryngeal findings. This reveals an exophytic mass affecting the anterior and middle third of the right vocal fold, the entire anterior commissure and the anterior third of the left vocal fold, without narrowing of the glottis lumen. The supraglottis and the subglottis are not affected by the tumor. Therefore, due to the massive involvement of the anterior commissure, the decision was made to proceed transcervically. Skin spray disinfection. Application of local anesthesia in a skin fold directly at the level of the thyroid cartilage. Skin ablation and sterile draping. Horizontal skin incision. Separation of the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Formation of a subplatysmal flap up to the thyroid incisura and caudally to the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior jugular vein with its branches. Ligation of the same. Exposure of the surface of the thyroid cartilage. Exposure of the ligamentum cornicum and the bovine cartilage.

On palpation, this extends up to the midline. The floor of the mouth and the base of the tongue are not infiltrated. Due to the large extension in the area of the tongue body, there is an indication for resection with possible defect reconstruction. The surgical procedure was discussed in detail with the patient and her family. A panendoscopy performed in domo showed no other suspicious lesions in the area of the upper aerodigestive tract.","Transfer of the patient to the operating theater. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleagues and induction of intubation anesthesia by the colleagues. After anesthesia has been administered, the surgeon positions the patient's head. First, the flexible gastroesophagoscopy is performed in the usual manner. This reveals the presence of an axial hiatal hernia. Despite a positive diaphanoscopy, a PEG tube is not inserted in consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The nasogastric tube is inserted. The right arm is then repositioned, the surgical field is wiped sterile after injection of Suprarenin cervically on both sides in the area of the skin incision. Sterile wiping and draping of the patient. Start of the operation by performing a protective tracheostomy. To do this, make an incision just below the cricoid cartilage over 1.5 cm. Cut through the cutaneous-subcutaneous tissue. Identification of the infrahyoid musculature. Identification of the thyroid isthmus. Sharp incision of the cricoid cartilage. Undermining the thyroid isthmus with the clamp. Performing isthmus splitting after extensive bipolar coagulation. Exposure of the anterior tracheal wall and incision in the 2nd to 3rd intertracheal space. A visor tracheotomy is inserted and epithelialized in the usual manner using sutures. The patient is then reintubated and enoral tumor resection begins after insertion of the mouth retractor. Snare the tongue and begin tumor resection with the harmonic knife from anterior to posterior. A palpatory distance of approx. 1 cm from the tumor is maintained. During dissection, a branch of the lingual artery is exposed in depth. This can be safely exposed and ligated. After removal of the tumor specimen, it is placed on a cork plate and the anterior, posterior, lateral and medial resectate margins are marked. Basally, the specimen is marked short long anterior basally and long long posterior basally. The specimen is sent for frozen section diagnostics. After receiving the histology, a narrow resection margin of 0.4 cm is seen basally anteriorly. A new piece is then removed from the anterior basal wound bed and also sent for final histopathological assessment, this time marked with a suture. After subtle hemostasis using bipolar coagulation forceps, the radialis graft is lifted from the right arm by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (4.5 x 7.5 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to protect the ulnar artery. Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vascular clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clip. After 5 minutes under good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation. Visualization of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First the radial artery is removed, then two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Defect coverage of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Neck dissection is first performed on the left side. Here, regions I - IV are removed while sparing all non-lyphatic structures, including the gl. submandibularis. The superior thyroid artery and the facial artery are then dissected for subsequent anastomosis. Now also similar neck dissection on the right. Here, region Ia and Ib are also completely removed, but the submandibular artery is only mobilized as far as necessary and then refixed in its old position. After removal of the radialis graft, the graft is pulled through the defect tunnel. Insertion of the graft in the specified location and suturing using several single button sutures in the usual manner. Anastomosis of the radial artery to the superior thyroid artery and of 2 veins in an end-to-side manner to the internal jugular vein. At the end, subtle hemostasis using bipolar coagulation forceps. The neck is now dry. Wound closure using cutaneous and subcutaneous sutures in the usual manner after insertion of a flap.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage

A sample was taken alio loco, which revealed a G2 squamous cell carcinoma. CT imaging of the primary was not conclusive due to dental artifacts. Sonography showed a cN0 neck status. The patient was informed in detail about the procedure and had sufficient time to ask questions.","After induction of anesthesia by the anesthesiology colleagues, first rigid tracheoscopy. The trachea is free of irritation up to the tracheal bifurcation. Subsequently intubation by the anesthesia colleagues and transition to flexible esophagoscopy. Under constant air insufgflation, pre-scopy up to the stomach, the mucosa is free of irritation even with inversion, no ulcer, no bleeding. Then aspirate the air from the stomach and carefully mirror back. No abnormalities in the esophagus. Subsequent low head position and mircolaryngoscopy. The vocal folds and anterior commissure are smooth and without irritation, as are the arytenoid cartilage and postcricoid region. The piriform sinus and vallecula are freely unfoldable, no mass. Tonsils and base of trachea also without irritation and free to palpate. Subsequent addition of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Snaring of the tongue and insertion of a covered mouth guard. A whitish mucosa with extensions and palpatory hardening, approx. 2x0.5 cm in size, is visible on the left edge of the tongue in the posterior third. The mucosa appears to be easily displaceable against the muscle. The area was then resected with an electric needle, suture marking at ant/post and superior. The mass was completely removed by palpation and inspection. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section examination. This revealed higher grade dysplastic cells in the superior margin up to 0.1 cm from the resection margin, which is why a further resection was performed here, which was then sent for final histology. Subsequent meticulous hemostasis using bipolar coagulation and adaptive sutures with Vicryl 4-0. Removal of the mouth retractor, removal of the tongue loop, dental status as preoperative. Conclusion: the patient underwent an excision biopsy for cT1 cN0 tongue margin carcinoma with alio loco confirmed squamous cell carcinoma at the left tongue margin. The frozen section resulted in a complete resection; in the case of higher grade dysplasia in the superior margin, a further resection was performed.

Due to the number and shape of conspicuous lymph nodes on both sides of the neck, which were described on CT, the indication for tumor removal and neck dissection on both sides was given in advance.","First, the patient is positioned and another panendoscopy is performed to confirm the findings. The findings are essentially unchanged compared to the previous examination, with the tumor extending as described above. Otherwise no indication of a secondary tumor. Then insertion of the Olympus oral retractor and adjustment of the tonsil lodge. Then insertion and positioning of the robotic arms. Use a monopolar spatula and Maryland forceps. Then expose the tumor. With a sufficient safety margin, start the resection on the anterior soft palate parauvularly. The resection is then performed along the posterior molar to the base of the tongue via the glossotonsillar groove. As the tumor cannot be reliably separated from the base of the tongue here, a small part of the base of the tongue is resected. The tumor is then developed and a partial resection of the posterior palatal arch is performed. The dissection is performed in such a way that a soft tissue margin remains on the tonsil capsule. There is no evidence of tumor infiltration in the area of the lateral tonsil capsule. After complete removal, the specimen is then thread-marked and sent for histopathological assessment. In the area of the scarce resections at the glossotonsillar groove and at the base of the tongue, additional marginal samples are taken, which are assessed as tumor-free in the frozen section. After tumor removal, the most subtle hemostasis is performed. Then absolutely dry wound conditions. Then removal of the oral retractor and removal of the surgical instruments. The patient is then repositioned for neck dissection on both sides. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline on both sides of the neck. Then start the neck dissection on the left side via a skin incision along the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then layer-by-layer dissection in depth after cutting through the platysma, exposing the anterior edge of the muscle. Then expose the cervical vascular sheath. Now dissect along and expose the cervical vascular sheath. A large conglomerate of lymph nodes can be seen in the area of the venous angle. The lymph nodes also appear clinically conspicuous here. Then dissection of level Ib while preserving the branches of the external carotid artery and the internal jugular artery. The capsule of the submandibular gland is not removed during dissection. Subsequently, further dissection of levels II, III, IV and V. Numerous lymph nodes already extend caudally along the cervical vascular sheath, so that the dissection is also carried out far caudally. When the specimen is placed in the caudal section, an opening of the thoracic duct can be seen, with fluid leaking out here. This area is then sutured over with a small amount of sternocleidomastoid muscle and the entire region carefully stitched over. Even when the intrathoracic pressure was raised via a peep by the colleagues in the anesthesia department, there was no further leakage of chyle. Subsequent subtle hemostasis and insertion of a Redon drain. Then two-layer wound closure. Now move to the right side. Here too, skin incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then layer-by-layer dissection in depth. Cut through the platysma, then expose the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the cervical vascular sheath. Subsequently, a clearly smaller conglomerate can be seen at the lymph node in the venous angle. Then evacuation of level Ib, sparing the branches of the external carotid artery and internal jugular artery. Level II and III were also removed. After no further suspicious nodes are found in the caudal region, which are also not described on CT, and the tumor is nowhere near the midline, no further clearing of levels IV and V is performed. Subtle hemostasis is then performed and a Redon drain is then inserted. Here too, subsequent two-layer wound closure. After bandaging, the procedure is completed and the patient is transferred to the recovery room after extubation.","Transoral robot-assisted tumor removal, Neck dissection

The same applies to the postcricoid region and the esophageal entrance. Inspection of the vallecula and the base of the tongue. Inconspicuous conditions here too. Subsequently, removal of the small drainage tube and insertion of the reinforced retractor. Inspection of the oral cavity and the oral vestibule. An exophytic, highly visible mass can be seen in the area of the dorsum of the tongue at the transition to the right edge of the tongue. Mark the planned resection margins. The tumor is then cut around using the electric needle and scissors. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. The definitive lateral and medial margin samples are then taken and sent for definitive histological processing. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Injection of ropivacaine for postoperative analgesia. Repeated hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Adaptation of the wound edges using inverting sutures with PDS 4-0. The mucosa in the area of the remaining oral cavity and the oral vestibule is free of irritation on all sides. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Removal of the mouth blocker and completion of the operation without complications. Note: The gastric polyps should also be assessed gastroenterologically at intervals.","Resection and Panendoscopy

Here, dysplasia is still found in the dorsal part, and a new microlaryngoscopic ablation is performed in the dorsal part, well within the normal healthy area, for final histological assessment. Hemostasis with a supratip. If the wound is inconspicuous, repositioning for modified radical neck dissection on the right side: curved skin incision. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid after cutting through the platysma. No ligation of the external jugular vein, but lateral displacement to reduce lymphoedema. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. Now from caudal to cranial mobilization of the sternocleidomastoid. Locate the accessor nerve, which is found, dissected further cranially and spared in the further course of the operation. Establish the upper resection margin at the belly of the digaster muscle, which is followed ventrally. Now lateral to the internal jugular vein, place the caudal neck preparation in the area of region IV. No conspicuous lymph nodes here and from caudal to cranial, after exposing the vagus nerve and phrenic nerve on the scalenus muscles, consecutive development of the lateral neck preparation up to the accessorius triangle. Detachment of the same along the digastric muscle. Dissection of the submandibular gland, which is then deposited at the whartonian duct. The facial artery and facial vein are selectively dissected and spared. In the depth of the submandibular region (region Ib), removal of a conspicuous lymph node without capsular perforation. Careful hemostasis and dissection of the carotid bifurcation, especially the thyroid artery for subsequent vascularization. Now complete the ventral neck preparation and repeat hemostasis. Irrigation with H2O and repositioning for neck dissection on the left side: also here skin incision and dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and, while preserving the accessorius nerve, the jugular vein, exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and here a modified radical neck dissection of levels II, III, IV and V is performed. Here too, meticulous hemostasis and completion of the procedure on the left side of the neck. Now horizontal skin incision for tracheotomy. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue to the infralaryngeal musculature, blunt, partly sharp cutting of the same and mobilization of the thyroid isthmus. This is undermined, grasped with 2 clamps and treated with a tobacco pouch suture after transection. The tracheal lumen is now opened between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp. Formation of a Björk flap and transfer to a Rügheim cannula. Further ventilation is problem-free. Fixation of the cannula to the skin of the neck with 2 retaining threads. Now repositioning for tumor resection: After setting the tonsil stop, the tumor is now resected far into the healthy tissue with the electric knife, in some cases also sharply with the .................................... coagulation, initially from the anterior and posterior palatal arch, the cheek region is partly included and thus the tumor is resected far into the macroscopically healthy tissue. The tumor is detached from the hard palate with the freer, also from the mandible and traced further caudally into the depth of the lateral pharyngeal wall. Resection of the inner mandibular corticalis, which is sent with the tumor specimen. Now develop the entire tumor specimen transcervically and carefully stop the bleeding. Now take representative marginal samples from all 4 quadrants, which are found to be tumor-free in the frozen section assessment. Now reposition for radial artery flap harvesting: After abjuring and sterile draping, make an S-shaped incision from the antecubital region to the distal. Preparation of a skin graft corresponding to the defect and preservation of the same after preparation of a broad-lumen arterial connection and a venous drainage route. Inguinal skin harvesting: Spindle-shaped, adapted detachment of a full-thickness skin graft in the right inguinal region. Meticulous hemostasis and under slight tension, the primary wound closure is quite successful. A Redon drain is inserted beforehand. After irrigation with ............ solution of the graft, the forearm graft is subtly sutured into the defect. The superior thyroid artery is now dissected caudally transcervically and anastomosed to the arterial segment of the forearm flap.

Now insert the tonsil retractor and resect the mass with the electric needle. With a safety distance of approximately 1 cm. Deep dissection up to the medial pterygoid muscle and leaving a minimal layer of the posterior palatal arch. After cranial resection directly at the posterior edge of the alveolar ridge of the maxilla and also resection in the area of the cheek with a clear distance from the stenon's duct. As the mass is firmly attached to the posterior alveolar ridge of the mandible and also appears to infiltrate into the depths, it is dissected there with a safe distance to the periosteum of the mandible and from there the periosteum is pushed away from the bone with the <LOCATION> Raspa. At one point, the tumor appears to have attacked the cortical bone. The resection extends along the posterior floor of the mouth in the base of the tongue, here with an increased safety margin. The submandibular gland of the right side is exposed in depth and separated from the tumor preparation. After complete removal, the specimen is now marked with a thread (short/short = towards the uvula; short/long = towards the upper jaw; long/long = towards the base of the tongue and green thread along the lower jaw). On closer inspection, a small region between the lower jaw and the base of the tongue appears to be infiltrated right into the resection margin. Therefore, a resection is performed starting from the lower jaw along the floor of the mouth to the base of the tongue. Both preparations are sent for frozen section examination. The subsequent result shows that one site of the main preparation was indeed not healthy, but the corresponding resection no longer shows a tumor, so that a local R0 resection is present. An additional frozen section examination of the wound bed was performed, which was also tumor-free. Now insertion of a hydrogen swab and turning to neck dissection. First modified radical neck dissection type III left, level Ib to V: Curved skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Dissection through subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure and sparing of the external jugular vein. Identification of the vagus nerve, the omohyoid muscle and the posterior digaster venter muscle. An approx. 4 cm large metastasis is seen in the area of the venous angle, which makes the entire dissection difficult. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, which can be easily separated from the tumor mass. A facial vein is not found in the typical location, but much further caudally. This is now dissected from caudal to cranial, can be dissected for about 5 cm, but must then be separated due to very close contact with the tumor conglomerate. After identification of the hypoglossal nerve and skeletonization of the submandibular gland from the caudal side, the tumour conglomerate is separated from the carotid artery and sent for final histology. At the same time, the superior thyroid artery can be visualized well. Now turn to the lateral neck preparation. Expose the vagus nerve and the scalene muscles and dissect around level IIb caudally while sparing the plexus branches. Now turn to selective neck dissection of the left side, levels II to IV: Similarly curved skin incision along the sternocleidomastoid anterior edge. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Long dissection and sparing of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Identification of the accessorius nerve, the omohyoid muscle and the posterior digaster venter muscle. Dissection along the internal jugular vein while sparing the cervical vein. First form and remove the medial neck preparation after identifying the hypoglossal nerve and the superior thyroid artery and then form the lateral neck preparation from cranial to caudal while protecting the plexus branches. Now turn to the tracheotomy: Approx. 2 1/2 cm long, horizontal incision over the cricoid cartilage. Dissection through subcutaneous tissue, identification and spreading of the prelaryngeal musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Directly caudal to it, the first tracheal ring on the right side appears fractured and scarred. Exposure of a very small thyroid isthmus and bipolation of the same. Now expose the anterior tracheal wall, which shows normal anatomy again caudal to the first tracheal ring. Horizontal incision into the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring and formation of a small Björk flap. Epithelialization of the flap using tracheostomy sutures.

Alternation, assistance: <CLINICIAN_NAME>) Lifting of the radialis flap initially from the subfascial radial side. In doing so, protection of the nerve.......................... The radial artery is exposed and clamped. Continue the operation under pulse oximeter observation. Elevation of the radialis flap now also subfascially from the ulna, incision is continued along the forearm along the brachioradialis muscle up to the crook of the elbow in a curved shape. Inclusion of the cephalic vein in the flap as a superficial drainage system. Subcutaneous tissue is still included cranial to the skin island. Flap pedicle is exposed up to the crook of the elbow. No changes in saturation on the finger after approx. 45 min. This always remained at 100%, even after clamping the radial artery. The radial artery is therefore now disconnected and supplied caudally and cranially by means of a puncture ligature. Successive elevation of the flap along the course of the pedicle and treatment of smaller vascular branches with clips. The flap pedicle contains the superficial and deep venous system as well as the radial artery. The radial artery is dissected up to the olecranon and removed before the outlet of the interosseous artery and treated with a puncture ligature. The venous outflow is removed after the confluence of the superficial and deep venous system in the area of the cephalic vein. The vein is ligated. Flap is removed and flushed with heparin. The vascular pedicle was already freed from adventitia during dissection. Subsequent insertion of the flap into the oral cavity oropharyngeal defect: First cut through the digastric muscle from the neck side. A tunnel, 2 transverse fingers wide submandibularly, is then created as a passage for the pedicle. The flap is then inserted into the defect and the pedicle is passed through the tunnel. Successive suturing of the flap into the enoral defect using single button Vicryl 3/0 sutures. Complete defect coverage without tension. The superior thyroid artery is then exposed, dissected, freed from the adventitia, cut and ligated distally. The proximal part is prepared with the arterial anastomosis and sutured with 8/0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, strong pulse and strong venous return. The access of the facial vein to the internal jugular vein is chosen for the venous anastomosis. The flap pedicle is first sutured with infrahyoid muscles to prevent kinking. The vein size is measured. A coupler size 3/0 is selected. The veins are trimmed while they are anastomized with the coupler without tension. Gelitta is inserted to prevent kinking of the vascular pedicle. The wound is then carefully rinsed again and the blood is stopped. The wound is closed in layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. A tracheal cannula with a core is inserted and fixed with sutures. The vessels of the vascular pedicle were fixed to the neck skin area using markers and checked using Doppler sonography. The procedure was completed without complications. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue the antibiotic treatment started with Unacid i.v. 3 x 1.5 g. Heparin perfusor with 500 E/h for 3 days in total. Please keep patient ventilated for one night. Regular checks of the vascular pedicle by ultrasound and clinically according to the scheme. Please feed patient via inserted PEG for 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, build up diet.","Transoral resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

The tumor originates from the medial hypopharyngeal wall, just extending laterally onto the arytenoid hump, but neither affecting the interary region nor the postcricoid. Laterally, the tumor extends in the entrance of the piriform recess along the anterior wall and just reaches the lateral side wall. The tumor is quite easy to move with the suction cup, in particular there is mobility towards the arytenoid cusp on the left. A deep infiltration of the cusp does not appear to be present here. The vocal cords are also clinically mobile on both sides. A PEG tube is inserted as part of the final esophagoscopy. The left-sided hypopharyngeal tumor is then adjusted with the Steiner tube. Adjustability is good. The tumor is then completely ablated with the CO2 laser under microscopic vision. The safety margin is at least 0.5 cm. The tumor can be easily removed from the deep layers, especially from the arytenoid cusp, in healthy tissue. Nevertheless, a final resection is taken from the left arytenoid hump and sent for final histology. Careful hemostasis. This is followed by repositioning for neck dissection, first on the left: For this, skin incision in a skin fold, 2 to 3 transverse fingers submandibularly. After skin incision, dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and exposure of the platysmal flap. Creation of platysmal flaps caudally and cranially. Dissection of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid to the vascular nerve sheath. Expose the posterior venter of the digastric muscle cranially. Dissection now along the omohyoid muscle from distal to proximal to the hyoid bone. Dissection of the lower edge of the submandibular gland and completion of the neck resectate to the hyoid bone. Dissection along the posterior digastric venter muscle to the base of the skull and subsequent dissection of the internal jugular vein. The dissection reveals numerous conspicuous lymph nodes. Level IIb and Va in particular show pronounced lymph node involvement. All vascular nerve structures were spared during the dissection. After elevation of regions II, III and IV, level 5 is completely elevated while sparing the plexus and the accessorius nerve. Subsequent neck dissection on the right side: The same procedure is used here with a corresponding skin incision 2 to 3 transverse fingers submandibularly. Creation of cranial and caudal platysmal flaps and dissection of the vascular nerve sheath by exposing the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Dissection along the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid bone and along the posterior digastric venter muscle in the cranial region. Dissection along the internal jugular vein and also here elevation of the neck block in regions II, III and IV. Conspicuous nodes are found particularly in level IIb. Finally, also sparing the accessorius nerve and the cervical plexus, elevation of level V. Careful hemostasis on both sides. Insertion of 10 Redon drains on both sides, subcutaneous sutures and skin sutures on both sides. Sterile wound dressing.","Laser resection, Bilateral neck dissection, PEG placement, Tracheostomy, Panendoscopy

Laryngoscopy was then performed using a Kleinsasser C-tube. Inspection of the endolarynx, revealing an exophytic mass originating from the right interaryngeal region and affecting the posterior 2/3 of both vocal folds without significant subglottic spread. Thus verification of the indication. Skin spray disinfection. No local anesthesia after consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Cervical skin ablation and sterile draping. Creation of a skin incision, lifting of a subplatysmal apron flap. Placement of bridle sutures. Exposure and ligation of the anterior jugular vein with its branches. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side. Exposure and sparing of the right external jugular vein. Exposure and sparing of the right auricularis magnus nerve. Exposure of the right accessorius nerve, the posterior venter of the digaster muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Successive evacuation of the posterior and anterior neck preparation while sparing the above-mentioned structures and the plexus branches.

Hemostasis on both sides using bipolar coagulation and subsequent skeletonization of the hyoid bone, skeletonization of the thyroid cartilage at its posterior ..................................... on both sides. Strict care is taken to ensure that the dissection is performed subperichondrally on the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage, thus sparing the piriform sinus as much as possible on both sides. Dissection of the prelaryngeal muscles at the level of the hyoid bone. Subsequent exposure of the free epiglottis margin and median pharyngotomy. Dissection along the lateral edge of the epiglottis on both sides and the aryepiglottic folds on both sides. Maximum protection of the pharyngeal mucosa in the area of the piriform sinus on both sides, transverse mucosal incision postcricoidally. Joining the lateral incision with this transverse incision and entering the region between the posterior wall of the trachea and the anterior wall of the oesophagus. Dissection caudally in this layer. Repeated hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Dissection of the thyroid gland from the side wall of the trachea on both sides, inspection of the specimen from the caudal side and easy removal of the specimen at the level of the already inserted tracheostoma. A tracheal cartilage clip is then resected and sent with the specimen for final histology. The anterior border samples are then taken: posterior edge of the tracheal sedimentation, postcricoid mucosa, medial wall of the right piriform sinus, medial wall of the left piriform sinus, base of the tongue. All marginal samples were found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleagues. Subsequently, cricopharyngeal myotomy in the typical manner. Subsequently, three-layer pharyngeal suture (thin submucosal connective tissue layer, transversely striated pharyngeal wall muscles, prelingual residual muscles). The pharyngeal suture is then reinforced using several cut pieces of Tachosil. Dry conditions. Placement of 2 Redon drains on both sides. Completion of the epithelialization of the tracheostoma at its cranial and lateral edges. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure dressing. Completion of the procedure without complications.

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment was indicated. Sonographically, a cN1 neck status on the right was suspected.","First confirmation of the extent. There is an exophytic tumor of the right tonsillar lobe, completely consuming the tonsillar lobe with transition to the soft palate up to the right-sided uvula base. In addition, the tumor extends slightly over the caudal tonsillar lobe, growth over the glossotonsillar groove to the free edge of the tongue on the right and here infiltration of an area of the tongue measuring approx. 3 cm with a penetration depth of approx. 1 cm. Infiltration also of the circumscribed posterior floor of the mouth. The PEG tube is inserted first. For this, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. With good diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach. The PEG tube is then inserted using the usual suture pull-through method. Transoral tumor resection is now performed. The tumor is cut around with a safety margin of 1 cm. Removal of the uvula and subtotal removal of the soft palate. Resection up to the buccal. Release of the tooth pocket of the posterior mandibular tooth; if close to the tumour, push off the periosteum here and thus achieve good mobilization in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth. The floor of the mouth is also resected with a safety margin of 1 cm. Resection of the tongue section with a safety margin of approx. 1.5 cm. Also safe in sano resection in depth. Basal resection up to the submandibular gland. The tumor area is now completely covered with marginal samples. These are all assessed as free of dysplasia and tumor. Only in the area of the base of the tongue is there an unclear change that cannot be further differentiated histologically. For this reason, a resection is performed later, which is again assessed as completely tumor-free and dysplasia-free. This results in a defect of the posterior floor of the mouth, the edge and base of the tongue, the lateral wall of the pharynx, the posterior wall of the pharynx and subtotally the soft palate. Therefore a clear indication for defect reconstruction. Neck dissection of the left side is performed first. To do this, make a skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid, digastric and omohyoid muscles. Exposure and release of the capsule of the submandibular gland. Subsequent evacuation of levels II a to V a with careful preservation of the facial vein, superior thyroid artery, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve as well as the cervical plexus branches. Final wound inspection. If the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Macroscopically, there are no suspicious nodules. Neck dissection is now performed on the opposite side. The procedure is basically the same here. However, in the area of the jugular facial angle, a coarse and therefore highly visible mass measuring approx. 2 cm can be seen. This can ultimately be extirpated while preserving the facial vein, without definite evidence of perinodal growth. Otherwise, after release of the submandibular gland, in addition to levels II a and V a, while sparing the structures already mentioned on the opposite side. Release of level I b. Here several macroscopic but not suspicious nodules. Subsequent extirpation of the gland. Partial resection of the digastric muscle and thus creation of a wide access to the enoral side, good overview. Protection of the hypoglossal nerve is possible. The radialis graft is now removed. After marking the graft specially configured for the tongue edge and soft palate, cut around the graft. Expose the cephalic vein. Exposure of the superficial ramus, radial nerve, which can be preserved. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle. Release of the radial artery. Strictly subfascial dissection. The cephalic vein shows no confluence with the deep venous system in the antecubital region, so it is clipped later and not used further. Exposure of a venous confluence and a further venous outflow. Exposure and preservation of the ulnar artery and common interosseous artery. Later, with a normal vital graft and normal blood supply to the hand, removal of the graft after ligation of the feeding and draining vessels. Careful hemostasis. Subsequent careful two-layer wound closure and insertion of the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the right groin. Application of the vacuum pump and application of the Cramer splint in the functional position for full-thickness skin harvesting from the right groin. For this purpose, cutting around an area of skin measuring a good 12 x 7 cm. Strict cutaneous elevation, subcutaneous mobilization. Insertion of a 10 Redon drain. Multi-layered subcutaneous wound closure and skin suture. The graft is now inserted. This is considerably more difficult due to the swelling that has now occurred. Overall, however, sufficient reconstruction of the defect is achieved, combined transorally and transcervically. Positioning of the stem. Preparation of the facial artery in the case of a very slender superior thyroid artery. Passage of the artery in anastomosis with 8-0 Ethilon. Finally, regular venous return via the draining veins. First condition the superior thyroid vein. Perform a venous anastomosis with the coupler system using a coupler size 3.0. There is now largely strong venous return via the second vein. The facial vein is therefore also conditioned and a further venous anastomosis is performed with the size 3.5 coupler. Regular circulation is then achieved. Positive smear tests and excellent graft perfusion, so that a size 10 Redon drain is subsequently inserted and the wound is closed in two layers. Due to the advanced swelling, a final protective tracheostomy is performed. This involves a skin incision at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and sucutaneous tissue. Entering the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior wall of the trachea. Dissection of the thin thyroid isthmus. Subsequent insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap. Subsequent problem-free transfer to a size 8 low-cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT3 cN1 oropharyngeal/oral cavity carcinoma on the right. If the graft heals properly and the graft is intact, a gradual diet can be started from the 8th postoperative day after inspection. Decannulation should be possible in a timely manner.","Pharyngeal partial resection, Neck dissection, Free flap coverage (ALT)

Tumor resection and neck dissection on the left. After positioning and sterile washing and draping of the patient, insertion of the McIvor mouth blocker and inspection of the tumor region. The tumor extends from the left tonsil onto the anterior palatal arch up to the uvula and caudally to the glossotonsillar groove and the base of the tongue. The resection is first started with the monopolar needle in the area of the soft palate. Safety distance 1 to 1.5 cm. The entire anterior palatal arch must be removed. Then move on to the tonsil region. Further dissection with scissors and bipolar forceps so that the tonsil is removed together with the tumor tissue. The musculature must also be removed in depth and the soft tissues of the neck are accessed. The neck fat becomes visible. Then further dissection in the area of the glossotonsillar groove and the base of the tongue, part of the base of the tongue is also removed. Medially, the largest parts of the posterior palatal arch are also removed due to tumor infiltration. The specimen is placed on cork for frozen section. The frozen section still shows moderate dysplasia in the area of the soft palate. A superficial resection is performed and a marginal sample is sent to the frozen section. This is then tumor-free. Then transition to neck dissection on the left side. Skin incision in a transverse skin fold. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Removal of the neck preparation II a to V a, sparing the plexus branches. The accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve are exposed and spared. Now widen the opening enorally so that 3 transverse fingers can be comfortably inserted into the mouth area. The flap pedicle is to be pulled through here later. Now dissect the connecting vessels. Dissection of the superior thyroid and facial vein as well as the external jugular vein. The patient has a good vascular situation and several options for connection. Radialis flap: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap boundaries (size) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa.

Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Covering of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Neck dissection on the right: injection of 10 ml Suprarenin along the skin incision on the front edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. Use the 15 mm scalpel to sharply cut through the skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma. The external jugular vein is now ligated. The ramus auricularis magnus is severed. Dissection of the platysma flap and dissection along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. The accessorius nerve is explored cranially. The nerve can be visualized without difficulty. The nerve is traced cranially to the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. The posterior belly of the GSM is also visualized. The omohyoid muscle is dissected and traced cranially. The jugular vein is now dissected from caudal to cranial. Level II b is detached, followed by II a, III, IV and V in depth. The ACC and the vagus nerve are exposed and spared. The anterior neck preparation is detached from the internal jugular vein and facial vein without any problems. The hypoglossal nerve is exposed and spared. Hemostasis using bipolar forceps. At the end of the procedure, there is no bleeding. Placement of a 10 Redon drain. Platysma suture using 4.0 Vicryl and skin suture using 4.0 Ethilon. The nervus accessorius showed an anatomical variant and ran above the jugular vein. The nerve was also spared. After removal of the graft, it is rinsed with heparin, then the flap is sutured into the defect: first sutures are placed, the graft is inserted and the pedicle is passed through the large tunnel. The flap is successively sutured into the defect with 3-0 Vicryl single-button sutures, folded in the palatal arch area. This results in tension-free, complete defect coverage. The superior thyroid artery and radial artery are then conditioned for vascular anastomosis. This is performed with 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. Subsequent conditioning of the veins, here conditioning of the two outflows from the superficial venous system. The deep venous system is clipped in the course of the operation. Two outlets of the facial vein are selected, the larger outlet is anastomosed with the larger outlet of the cephalic vein after conditioning the veins using a 3-0 vascular coupler. Here, after opening the clamp, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The smaller vein with a smaller outlet from the facial vein is then anastomosed using a 2-0 coupler. Here too, after opening the clamp, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. Subsequent irrigation of the wound area. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain on the right and 2 flaps on the left. Subsequently, after epithelialization of the tracheostoma, fixation of the cannula using sutures. Close inspection of the flap. This is vital. The procedure is then completed without complications. The patient is ventilated postoperatively for monitoring in the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics, which were started intraoperatively with Unacid, for 1 week. Continue heparin perfusor 500 units per hour for a total of 5 days. Flap control according to the scheme for 5 days, both clinically and by Doppler sonography. A suture marker was placed on the left side of the neck for this purpose. Feeding via the PEG tube for approx. 10 days, then gruel swallowing and, if necessary, diet build-up. After receiving the final histology, presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference to plan further treatment.","Tumor tonsillectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Then, entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the tumor. The tumor starts at the lower edge of the left tonsil and extends over the entire oropharyngeal side wall on the left side to the left vallecula and epiglottis edge, then sterile washing and draping and insertion of a Mc Ivor mouth block and start with a transoral tumor resection with a safety margin of 1 cm to 1.5 cm. Then repositioning for neck dissection on the left side. Skin incision at the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid of the submandibular gland, the digaster and the accessorius nerve, exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and exposure of the internal jugular vein. It becomes clear that there is a metastasis in level II that cannot be separated from the internal jugular vein, so the neck dissection is temporarily stopped on the left side and the procedure is switched to the opposite side so that the internal jugular vein can be safely preserved there. Here also skin incision in the usual manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle, the accessorius nerve, release of the medial neck block while sparing the facial vein. Then release of the neck block in levels IIb, III and IV while sparing the plexus branches. The internal jugular vein can be completely preserved. Now switch back to the left side and complete the neck dissection on this side while ligating and repositioning the internal jugular vein so that the metastasis in level II can be safely removed. Release the neck blocks IIb, III, IV and Va while sparing the plexus branches. The facial vein, which in this patient originates very far caudally from the internal jugular vein, can be preserved. The superior thyroid artery can also be preserved. Then remove the submandibular gland while sparing the lingual nerve and the lingual artery. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle and creation of an enoral access. Further tumor resection from the transoral side. The tumor can be retrieved en bloc and is suture-marked for frozen section. There is still carcinoma in situ on the posterior pharyngeal wall towards the medial side. Here, another large resection is performed and a final margin sample is taken. The final marginal sample R0, finally all R0. Lifting of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The radialis graft is lifted 9 x 7 cm, from the left side. To do this, first mark the graft and the skin incision on the forearm up to the elbow. Then make a skin incision in the marked area, expose the venous plexus in the elbow area, then expose the brachioradialis muscle. Visualization of the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve, then visualization of the superficial ramus, the radial nerve with its branches. Locate the radial artery, clamp the radial artery using a vascular clip for 10 minutes. The connected pulse oximeter shows a continuous 100 % oxygen saturation, so that the radial artery can finally be severed and stitched with an overlocking suture. The radialis graft is then lifted off the tendons while sparing the ulnar artery and the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Dissect the pedicle cranially while clipping off the branches. A superficial and a deep vein are taken from the venous system with good confluence. Deposition of the radialis graft first in the venous limb, here it becomes apparent that only the deep vein conveys blood to the outside, the superficially prepared vessel does not convey blood and probably cannot be used for anastomosis. Now the arterial limb is removed and the radialis graft is fitted into the defect. This is very difficult as the defect is three-dimensional and sutures must be placed transcervically and the graft sutured in place. The rest is sutured in from the transoral side. This is again very difficult on the posterior pharyngeal wall in the cranial region, as the defect also extends very far towards the border of the nasopharynx due to the resection. Then preparation of the blood vessels. The superior thyroid artery is prepared as the artery and the facial vein as the vein. Now perform the arterial anastomosis in the usual manner with Ethilon 8-0 and then the venous anastomosis with a size 3.5 coupler. Insertion of a Redon drainage very far dorsally and two-layer wound closure on both sides. A Redon drain was also inserted on the right side. A tracheotomy was performed at the same time as the flap was lifted. Skin incision below the cricoid cartilage, separation of the fatty tissue, then exposure of the musculature and the linea alba, splitting of the musculature in the linea alba. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus, visualization of the anterior wall of the trachea. Entering the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. No Björk flap is created and later reintubation to a tracheal cannula 9.0 without any problems. The split skin is also removed from the right thigh at the same time as the graft is lifted; this is then sutured to the forearm in the usual way and a dorsal forearm splint is fitted. The patient is ventilated in the intensive care unit, given antibiotics for at least 24 hours and the flap is checked according to the usual schedule.","Resection, Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

The carcinoma at the base of the tongue showed deep ulceration, so that defect coverage using a radial flap was indicated.","Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Transoral tumor resection: insertion of rubber-reinforced wound blockers. Attachment of the tongue with a reining suture. Now a good overview of the tongue. The tumor is now resected far into the healthy tissue, at least 2 cm to all sides. This results in an almost complete hemi-glossectomy on the right, parts of the floor of the mouth as well as the sublingual gland and the sublingual/submandibular gland at the back are also removed. The lingual nerve is included in the resection. The tumor is thread-marked and sent for a frozen section. In the frozen section to all sides in healthy tissue, thus R0 resection. PEG insertion: Advancement of the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach. After creating a diaphanoscopy, placement of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube in a typical manner without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall. After patho-histological confirmation of the R0 resection, transfer to neck dissection on both sides: skin disinfection both in the head/neck area on both sides as well as the left forearm and right groin. Injection of a total of 20 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline in the area of both sides of the neck. Start of neck dissection on the left: Curved skin incision in a neck fold or along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Subsequent exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the digastric muscle and submandibular gland. The capsule is also removed in the caudal region. Subsequent exposure of the internal and external carotid artery, internal jugular vein and facial vein. Dissection and exposure, neurolysis and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve, accessorius nerve, vagus nerve, cervical artery and superficial branches of the cervical plexus. Successive clearing of levels II-IV. In the anterior neck area, the facial artery, the superior thyroid artery and the superior thyroid vein are exposed and preserved. Neck dissection on the right side: This is performed in the same way as on the left side. Level II-IV evacuation in the same way. In addition, level Ib excision including the submandibular gland and the sublingual gland. Both structures were resected as part of the tumor resection, here also with resection of the lingual nerve. Dissection and exposure, neurolysis and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve, accessorius nerve, vagus nerve and cervical nerve. The hypoglossal nerve is preserved here, as on the opposite side. Slightly enlarged lymph nodes on the right more than on the left, no significant signs of metastasis macroscopically. Removal of the forearm flap: marking of the skin island of approx. 5x8 cm. Apply a tourniquet. Cut around the skin island subfascially, incision up to the crook of the elbow in a curved manner. Exposure of the superficial venous system. Successive development of the radialis flap subfascially also from the radial side. Preservation of the antebrachial nerve if it does not run into the flap. Caudal clipping of veins. Exposure of the radial artery. This is clamped and supplied using 4.0 Prolene puncture ligatures, whereby a .................... suture to the skin area is also made in the flap area. The flap is then lifted subfascially under the vascular pedicle Outgoing vessels are clipped. Dissection up to the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the connection between the deep and superficial system. Outgoing veins are clipped. The artery is very thin. Therefore, dissection up to the division of the radial and ulnar arteries. Exposure of the confluence of the radial artery. Exposure of the cephalic vein. Now open the tourniquet. Good perfusion of the flap. Hemostasis again. Deposition of the flap on the cephalic vein, which is ligated cranially at the confluence of the radial vein, which is ligated cranially and shortly after the exit from the brachial artery, which is supplied by means of a clip and puncture ligatures. Subsequently good further perusion of the ulnar artery. Irrigation of the flap with heparin solution. Flap is voluminous overall due to the very thick subcutaneous layer. Subsequent insertion of the flap into the defect. Enlarge the tunnel again until it is three transverse fingers wide and one transverse finger high. The pedicle can be inserted through the tunnel into the soft tissues of the neck. Suture the flap, creating a slight tension through the thick subcutaneous layer. The flap is trimmed anteriorly in the area of the tip of the tongue. Complete defect coverage. The flap was partially sutured in place with sutures. Subsequent vascular anastomosis. Trimming of the superior thyroid artery and the radial artery. Suturing of these with 9.0 Ethilon. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and good venous return. Then suture the cephalic vein at an outlet from the relatively thick facial vein. Select a 3 mm outlet for this purpose. The confluence of the radial vein is treated with clips. In the area of the facial vein, the cranial parts were ligated or supplied with clips. The distal superior thyroid artery was also supplied with clips. With good arterial flow, the alignment test shows good venous return. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Irrigation of the wound area on both sides. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain on both sides. The wound in the forearm area was closed with full-thickness skin. A piece of full-thickness skin of the appropriate size was removed from the groin for this purpose. After mobilization of the skin edges and subcutaneous tissue, the groin is now closed in layers with minimal tension. The skin is closed using back-stitch sutures and a Redon drain is inserted. The forearm is closed in layers in the proximal area. The full-thickness skin from the groin is sutured into the defect. Complete closure of the defect. A Mepilex hydrogel dressing is then applied. Wölckchen compresses are then applied. The arm is then wrapped with absorbent cotton and a splint is fitted. Fixation of the arm to the Cramer splint with a loose bandage. Forearm always well supplied with blood after flap removal. Due to the situation of significant swelling in the tongue/oral cavity area, decision to perform a temporary tracheotomy: Kocher's collar incision. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue up to the infrahyoid musculature. Division of these. Splitting of the very small thyroid isthmus after bipolar coagulation. Mobilization of the caudal skin. Subsequent creation of a small broad pedunculated Björk flap. Epithelialization of this in the typical manner with thibond sutures. Insertion of a 7 mm tracheal cannula. This is fixed with sutures. Slit compresses are applied to the inserted Redon drains, otherwise no further dressing. The site suitable for Doppler control was marked with a thread, right cervical. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue intraoperative antibiotics for approx. 1 week. Also continue heparin therapy, which was started intraoperatively at 500 I.U./hour. Flap control according to the scheme for 5 days. Nutrition via the inserted PEG tube for approx. 7-10 days.

Now indication for exclusion of a second malignancy and for enoral tumor resection. Sonography revealed a cN0 neck status.","After induction and deepening of the anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues, perform a rigid tracheoscopy under laryngoscopic control. Easy screening. The trachea is clear and inconspicuous up to the carina, as is the endolarynx including the subglottic region. Problem-free intubation by the surgeon and positioning of the patient. First, flexible esophagogastroscopy was carried out: the gastroscope was inserted under laryngoscopic control. Easy visualization of the stomach. This is inconspicuous and clear. Inspection of the oesophagus on reflection. Here there are ubiquitous small roundish, slightly papillomatous raised changes without suspicious conditions. No further measures required. Otherwise, the esophageal mucosa is free of irritation. Now enter with the small bore tube after inspection of the inconspicuous oral vestibule under dental protection. Inspection of the oral cavity. On the right side, in the area of the middle and transition to the posterior third of the right edge of the tongue, there is an exophytic, slightly exulcerated mass, easily delimited by palpation, approx. 2.5 cm in diameter with an estimated palpatory penetration depth of approx. ˝ cm. On the surface, there are whitish mucosal changes in the area surrounding the tumor, which are not primarily suspicious. The lateral floor of the mouth and the glossotonsillar groove are clear. On further examination, however, there is a circumscribed tear in the right glossotonsillar groove. In dry conditions, no further action is required here. The rest of the tongue is palpatorily and macroscopically free, as are the soft palate, the tonsil region and the base of the tongue. Inspection of the vallecula. A cystic change measuring approx. 1 cm on the median right side is seen here, macroscopically corresponding to a vallecula cyst. This is removed in toto with a double spoon and scissors in the sense of an excisional biopsy. Careful hemostasis using a suprarenal swab and no further measures in dry conditions. The epiglottis is clear. Inspection of the hypopharynx, which can be easily inserted into the tips of the piriform sinus and the esophageal opening and is clear. Adjustment of the endolarynx. Confirmation of inconspicuous findings with a normal glottic plane and inconspicuous supraglottic region. Transoral resection is now performed if the carcinoma is externally confirmed. The open mouth retractor is inserted for this purpose. Snare the free edge of the tongue. Cut around the lesion with a safety margin of approx. 1.5 cm. Also select a macroscopic safety margin of 1.5 cm in depth. Careful preparation with bipolar coagulation and monopolar dissection. The resectate is thread-marked for urgent definitive histology. Due to the whitish, leaking mucosal changes, a covering final margin sample is taken in the area of the free edge of the tongue and the floor of the mouth, which is also thread-marked for urgent histology. Macroscopically wide in sano resection. Meticulous hemostasis. Then adaptation of the wound edges with 3.0 Vicryl if there is a clear defect. Finally, intact conditions and with dry enoral conditions and slender tongue, completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Macroscopic in sano resection of a cT2 tongue margin carcinoma on the right. If the R0 situation is confirmed histologically, a neck dissection should be performed depending on the histology; in the case of G1 differentiation, a neck dissection may not be necessary, depending on ............, otherwise a selective neck dissection on the right should be performed from an infiltration depth of 4 mm.","Partial glossectomy

The above-mentioned procedure should therefore be performed.,"First alcohol disinfection. Application of local anesthesia. Apron-like skin incision. Subcutaneous preparation. Neck dissection is then performed on the left side. To do this, first expose the internal jugular vein, the accessorius nerve, the digastric muscle, the vagus nerve, the external and internal carotid artery. Then successive development of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the above-mentioned structures. Development of the medial neck preparation, also sparing the above-mentioned structures. Now repositioning for neck dissection on the right side. Infiltration, at least of the internal jugular vein. For this reason, the cranial and caudal ends of the internal jugular vein are exposed first. This is ligated. Then visualization of the accessorius nerve and the digastric muscle. Here it is already suspected that the accessor nerve is infiltrated by a large lymph node metastasis. This also infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The tumor block is now dissected laterally from the medial side along the external and internal carotid artery. During further dissection and visualization of the vagus nerve, this is also infiltrated at approximately the level of the carotid bifurcation and is therefore included. The tumor or neck preparation is then developed and removed, taking parts of the sternocleidomastoid muscle with it and partially taking the omohyoid muscle with it. Careful hemostasis, left and right. Now development of the larynx preparation. To do this, first expose the hyoid bone and the thyroid cartilage. Separation of the pharyngeal muscles from the thyroid cartilage on both sides. A tracheotomy is then performed beforehand. This involves cutting through the thyroid isthmus. This is stitched and then a tracheotomy is performed between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp. First incision of the caudal skin flap. Further development of the LE preparation. For this purpose, release of the piriform sinus on both sides. Then release the epiglottis at the free edge of the epiglottis. Then entering the pharyngeal tube and successive excision of the laryngeal preparation along the aryepiglottic fold. Incision united posteriorly postcricoidally. Detachment of the postcricoid mucosa, which is not affected by the cricoid cartilage plate. Further detachment of the laryngeal preparation. Separation in the area of the trachea and removal of the entire preparation for frozen section diagnostics. The edges of the incision are found to be tumor-free. Now rinse thoroughly. Cut through the pharyngeal muscles or the esophageal sphincter. Insertion of a Provox prosthesis 4 to 5 mm above the edge of the tracheal incision. This is successful without any problems. Then multi-layered, inverting pharyngeal suture. Readaptation of the infrahyoid muscles at the hyoid bone after subtle hemostasis has been performed. Now suturing of the tracheostoma and skin after insertion of 2 Redon drains, one on the left and one on the right. Multi-layer wound closure.

This was confirmed histologically. In addition, there is a simultaneous histologically confirmed hilar bronchial carcinoma. B-scan ultrasonography revealed a cN0 neck status. A CT scan was performed and a cT2-3 glottic carcinoma on the right was suspected, with no definite evidence of cartilage infiltration. The patient was informed in detail about the treatment options, surgery and radiotherapy. It was discussed in detail that a complete removal of the larynx may be necessary. The patient wishes to avoid this as far as possible. There is a history of occlusion of the right carotid artery in 1997 with apoplexy and hemiparesis on the left. This is also shown on CT. Based on the medical history and clinical findings, indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","Transfer of the patient to the operating theater. Followed by active patient identification. Consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Carrying out the team time-out. Two ECs in the blood bank. Induction of anesthesia and tracheo-bronchoscopy with 0° optics by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. This revealed the previously described finding of an exophytic mass of the entire vocal fold on the right side that extends subglottically and the anterior commissure could not be seen completely. Due to the extension, especially to the subglottic side, a partial laryngectomy, if necessary, was decided in the tumor conference. This is confirmed here. Now intubation by the anesthetist. Head positioning by the surgeon. Discussion of the skin incision with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Skin disinfection and infiltration anesthesia in the area of the planned skin incision and 10 ml Ultracaine. Skin disinfection and sterile draping of the surgical site. Marking of the landmarks of the jugulum, incisura thyroidea, cricoid cartilage and the central chin. Draw the skin incision from the hyoid bone in a zigzag shape running caudally in a skin fold, just below the cricoid cartilage. Now make the skin incision using a scalpel and cut through the subcutaneous and cutaneous tissue. Expose the platysma. Dissection of the platysma and subplatysmal preparation. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Enter the median plane and expose and dissect the thyroid cartilage as well as the ligamentum conicum, cricothyroid muscle and the ring button. Subsequent dissection of the perichondrium. An incision is made in the right paramedian using a scalpel. Then form a posteriorly pedicled periosteal flap to the right and left. Then open the thyroid cartilage paramedian on the left using a wheel. Prior to this, horizontal entry into the conic ligament with the scissors. Ensure that a sufficient piece of ligamentum conicum remains caudal to the thyroid cartilage for subsequent suturing. Now dissect alternately with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Endolaryngeal lumen is exposed. This shows the exophytic tumor, which occupies the entire right vocal fold and extends into the anterior commissure as well as subglottically and into the morgue sinus. First, the tumor is dissected subperiosteally on the left side using a Freer and the tumor is placed at a safe distance in the anterior third of the left vocal fold. Subperichondrial dissection is then performed on the right side using Freer until just before the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage. Ventrally, there is a questionable erosion of the thyroid cartilage, so saw it out as a triangular wedge on the right side. After further caudal dissection, the tumor can be completely resected down to the cricoid cartilage using a Freer and then using scissors down to the subglottic level. This is then thread-marked (vocal fold on the left, cranial sinus morgagni, caudal subglottic, dorsal posterior arytenoid and wound bed) for frozen section. The frozen section shows that the wound bed is just R0 and just reaches the resection margins in the area of the ary. For this reason, a resection is performed in the area of the wound bed between the cricoid cartilage and thyroid cartilage, which also goes to the frozen section. This is ultimately free. In addition, a resection and then a further marginal sample, dorsal ary, is again sent to the frozen section. This again shows CIS. Therefore, after demonstrating the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME> and as the patient wanted to avoid a laryngectomy if possible and had no previous history of swallowing problems, another resection was performed. The vocal process of the arytenoid is also resected. This is repeated as a resection for the frozen section. Finally, a third marginal sample is taken by skeletonizing the arytenoid up to the interary area. This ultimately reveals an R0 situation in the frozen section. Targeted and intensive hemostasis is then performed. Between the frozen section breaks and due to the tumor extension to the subglottic area, a tracheotomy is performed. This involves exposing the bovine cartilage. Undermining of the isthmus of the thyroid gland. This is narrow and thin. Therefore, successive coagulation of the same and transection of the same and exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. The skin was mobilized up to the jugulum and the incision widened again. Then, entry and identification between the second and third cricoid cartilage. Creation of tracheostomy sutures in the sense of caudal back-stitch sutures, as there are two in total, and two sutures cranially and reintubation. Now <CLINICIAN_NAME> recommends a selective neck dissection level II to IV due to the extent of the tumor in the sense of a transglottic carcinoma from supraglottic to subglottic. This is also performed during the frozen section break. To do this, mark the landmarks of the mastoid and sternocleidomastoid anterior margin on the right side and mark the skin incision. Then cut through the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma using a scalpel. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid anterior margin. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, which crosses over the jugular vein. Dissection on the sterno caudally and exposure and sparing of the accissor nerve. The neck is short overall and contains a lot of fatty tissue. Therefore difficult dissection conditions. Exposure of the course of the omohyoid muscle from caudal to cranial. Meticulous care is taken not to make any connection to the other surgical site. Exposure of the caudal belly of the submandibular salivary gland. Exposure of the digaster venter anterior muscle up to the omo. Exposure of the digaster venter posterior muscle up to the jugular vein. This is also visualized from caudal to cranial up to the junction with the digaster venter posterior muscle. Here the medial neck preparation is very voluminous. During careful dissection in this area, between the jugular vein and the digaster venter posterior muscle, i.e. medial/cranial to the internal jugular vein, there is an injury to an arterial vessel despite digital palpation. This was found not to be pulsating on palpation. Further dissection of this vessel revealed that it was a completely sclerosed internal carotid artery. Due to its kinking, in the sense of a vascular anomaly, it lies medially cranial to the internal jugular vein. There is no bleeding here as it is completely sclerosed. The vascular surgeon <CLINICIAN_NAME> is called in immediately. The pupils are equal at all times. The colleague confirms on CT that the internal carotid artery is completely occluded just above the bifurcation. She then completely transected the internal carotid artery. This shows that there is no reflux or flow. She ligated the cranial end and made several stitches around the caudal end using a prolene. This concludes the procedure. Now expose the hypoglossal nerve and the vagus nerve. Both are spared. Expose the facial vein and the cervical vein from caudal to cranial. The medial neck preparation is now removed. The superior thyroid artery is also exposed and spared. The vagus nerve and the accessorius nerve are exposed. The lateral neck preparation level V is left in place. Then, after insertion of a Redon and suturing of the same, two-layer wound closure. This was preceded by irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's. Another meticulous inspection of the surgical site. This is completely dry, after still occasional targeted bipolar coagulation. Then two-layer wound closure using subcutaneous suture and cutaneous suture. Finally, after re-inspection of the laryngeal site and bipolar coagulation, supra-tip swabs are inserted. For closure, the edges of the larynx are very well adapted using 4.0 Vicryl with three sutures. The perichondrium suture is then applied. This is placed completely over the larynx and closes it completely and very well. The coniotomy is also closed. This results in a very good aspect. Insertion of a narrow flap between the thyroid cartilage and the infrahyoid muscles. This is now also sutured successively from cranial to caudal over the thyroid cartilage using single button sutures, so that this is very well covered and there is no indication of a fistula. Subcutaneous suture, including the platysma, and cutaneous suture. Intraoperative administration of clindamycin and reintubation with a seven-gauge Rüsch cannula. Application of a pressure bandage. Intraoperative until the end of the operation, pupils equal and narrow on both sides. Now end of the procedure. The patient goes to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Conclusion: Postoperative administration of Clindamycin 4 x 600 mg over 24 hours. Continue with pressure bandage. A nasogastric tube was placed. Ligation of the ACI on the right in a complete stenosis that had been present for 20 years in post-apoplexy on the right with hemiparesis on the left. Check of the neurological status. Please note the final histology. Presentation at the tumor conference and clarification of the procedure regarding the bronchial carcinoma.","Partial laryngeal resection, Visor tracheotomy, Selective neck dissection

Emergency intervention already <2012>. <2012> the panendoscopy was performed to plan the surgical procedure and the PEG was placed. CT scan and clinically extensive laryngeal destruction with extensive growth per continuitatem in the soft tissues of the neck on the left. The multimorbid patient has a pronounced peripheral arterial occlusive disease with a history of leg amputation on both sides.,"After intubation via the supine tracheostoma and preparation by the anesthesia colleagues, a pharyngo/laryngoscopy was first performed. As described above, the tumor was found in the area of the left hypopharynx with extensive laryngeal destruction, extensive postcricoid growth towards the esophageal opening and extending directly in front of it. Growth towards the crania, also into the pre-epiglottic fatty tissue. Fixation of the hyoid on the right side, free conditions, with the tumor clearly reaching the midline, especially in the caudal transition. Inspection of the tracheostoma: the tracheostoma is reddened peristomally. Close inspection reveals a suspicious lesion in the area of the mucocutaneous anastomosis on the left side. This is a growth in the area of the tracheostoma. Therefore, skin incision to the apron flap with complete circumcision of the tracheostoma. Elevation of the apron flap with elevation of the platysma. Elevation of the platysma. First expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side, expose the omohyoid muscle of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle and initial attempt to visualize the laryngeal skeleton. This shows that the laryngeal skeleton on the right side has also been penetrated by tumor. Therefore, a muscular cuff was then left in place. Exposure and release of the hyoid on the right side. Ligation of the upper laryngeal bundle. Exposure and separation of the entire cervical vascular sheath. Dissection down to the prevertebral fascia. Mobilization of the larynx from the prevertebral fascia. This shows no infiltration by the tumor. Then, after complete loosening of the soft tissue on the right side, entry on the left side. This reveals infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and tumor infiltration of the right-sided cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Exposure and later ligation of the facial vein. Release of the sternocleidomastoid muscle cranially and caudally in the area of origin. Exposure and later removal of the accessorius nerve. Removal of the neck preparation. Here complete. First expose the internal jugular vein cranially and caudally. Release of the cervical part of the tumor, including level V and partial revision of the cervical plexus. Despite the previous mobilization of the surrounding tissue, there is now evidence of widespread infiltration of the cervical vascular sheath. Therefore now careful opening. Exposure of the common carotid artery and cranial dissection. Exposure of the vagus nerve. Tumor growth is now clearly visible in the internal jugular vein. This is therefore removed cranially and caudally. In addition, there is a small growth on the vagus nerve and a circumscribed macroscopic change in the nerve. In addition, direct infiltration of the perivascular tissue of the common carotid artery with detachment of the perivascular tissue. The tumor can now be separated by initially bluntly detaching the vagus nerve. A marginal sample was taken in the area of the common carotid artery on the detached perivascular tissue, also in the marginal area of the vagus nerve. Clear cranial infiltration of the superior thyroid artery, which is separated. The further course of the external carotid artery is now free, so that after visualization and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve, no extension of the radicality is required here. In the frozen section diagnostics, the marginal samples in the area of the vagus nerve as well as in the area of the common carotid artery are now tumor positive. Therefore, after discussing the case and demonstrating the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, long-distance resection of the vagus nerve and resection of the remaining perivascular connective tissue, but with preservation of the actual vessel wall. The vagus nerve is resected in an elongated fashion and sent for definitive histology. The post-resectate in the area of the common carotid artery is assessed as tumor-free. Exposure of the prevertebral fascia and complete detachment of the pharyngeal tube. Left-sided partial thyroidectomy also on the right side with adherence to the tumor DD scarred by the tracheotomy. Complete incision of the tracheostoma. Exposure of the trachea caudally, which is macroscopically and palpatorily free. Now turn to definitive tumor resection. To do this, enter above the hyoid on the right side, enter the right-sided vallecula, snare the epiglottis, widen the pharyngotomy. Resection along the right aryepiglottic fold. Due to the extensive laryngeal infiltration, the right-sided piriform sinus can only be partially released. Significant extensive postcricoid growth, here growing submucosally. Therefore, the entire postcricoid region must also be resected. As described above, the tumor can be seen in the area of the left piriform sinus as well as the left pharyngeal wall, in some cases extending to the midline. Excision of the tumor with a safety margin of approx. 1 cm, macroscopically in sano, macroscopically altered parts of the pharynx were removed. After removal, a caudal complete pharyngotomy with circular pharyngeal resection is performed; cranially, an approx. 2-5 cm wide pharyngeal strip can be preserved. Completely imaged marginal samples are now taken from the entire area of the detached mucosa as well as in the area of the base of the tongue and towards the esophagus. A marginal sample is also taken in the area of the separated trachea and in the area of the peristomally separated skin. These are diagnosed as completely tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics, so that a local R0 situation can be assumed overall. Now complete the neck dissection of the right side. Due to the tumor resection, an extended radical neck dissection of the left side was performed en bloc on the specimen. Complete exposure of the digastric muscle on the right side. Exposure of the accessory nerve, exposure of the internal jugular vein, exposure and preservation of the facial vein, exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Dissection of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Dissection of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Finally, the defect is measured when the wound is dry. Due to the highly critical vascular supply and the radical resection, microvascular reconstruction is not performed. Elevation of a pedicled pectoralis major graft measuring up to 14 x 9 cm in total from the left. For this purpose, marking of the flap for complete pharyngeal reconstruction and marking of a temporary deltopectoral flap. This is lifted up to the 2nd angiosome, strictly subfascial preparation. Incision of the pectoralis major flap. Broad-based caudal dissection up to the rectus aponeurosis. Release of the pectoralis major muscle. Suture fixation of the muscle to the skin island. Cranial dissection strictly subfascial including the pectoralis major muscle. Exposure of the pectoralis minor muscle and the pedicle vessels. Subsequent resection of the muscle, leaving a cuff around the vascular pedicle. Cranial complete release of the pedicle vessel to allow maximum rotation and maximum freedom from tension. Creation of a wide cervical skin tunnel. Complete tension-free placement and insertion into the pharyngeal defect. A nasogastric tube was previously inserted into the separated esophagus. The surrounding skin is then carefully and extensively mobilized pectorally. Careful hemostasis. Subsequent strong and multi-layered wound closure after insertion of two 10-gauge Redon drains. Resection of protruding skin and subsequent repositioning of the temporarily elevated deltopectoral flap. Cervically, the graft is successively sutured to the separated esophagus under visualization. Strictly inverting suture at the mucosal level. Reanastomosis of the caudal part of the pharynx into the esophageal reconstruction to avoid subsequent stenosis, successive incorporation of the graft. Final good fit. Creation of a wide pharyngeal tube as well as intact and tight conditions on all sides with the flap in proper vitality. After final wound inspection, the tracheostoma is sutured and a 10-gauge Redon drainage tube is inserted and the wound is carefully closed in two layers. Re-intubation onto a 12 Rüsch cannula, which is suture-fixed, and completion of the procedure at this point. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g, which should be continued for 24 hours postoperatively. Careful postoperative wound control in case of high risk of fistula due to complete pharyngectomy. Overall intraoperatively, a narrow R0 situation can be assumed in the area of the left common carotid artery, with overall extensive findings of a cT4a cN0 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the left.

Right-sided process with clear laryngeal penetration on CT and subglottic extension on panendoscopy.,"After bronchoscopic intubation and preparation by the anesthesia colleagues, the patient is positioned. Initially, the Kleinsasser tube is inserted under dental protection. The oral cavity and oropharynx are unremarkable, and the hypopharynx up to the tips of the piriform sinus and the entrance to the oesophagus is also unremarkable and clear. Subsequent endoscopically controlled insertion of a nasogastric feeding tube. Adjustment of the endolarynx. The exophytic tumor process can be seen on the right side, but in the area of the anterior commissure there is also a transition to the opposite side and palpation reveals a clear fixation on the laryngeal skeleton. Posteriorly, the mass extends to the arytenoid, so that a laryngectomy is indicated for oncological and functional reasons. The patient was then repositioned. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. Skin incision and lifting of an apron flap. Palpation of the laryngeal skeleton reveals the tumor section that has broken through, but this does not go into the skin. To ensure that a soft tissue mantle is preserved, the platysma is left on the specimen in the relevant area, otherwise the platysma is dissected cranially. High suture of the apron flap on both sides Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Carry out the neck dissection starting with the left side. First dissect the anterior part of the neck, preserving the cervical anterior aspect of the facial vein, the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Expose the accessory nerve and complete level V while carefully preserving the cervical plexus roots. Macroscopically no suspicious nodes on the left side. Careful hemostasis and turning to the opposite side. Same procedure in principle here, also not resected separately. Left-sided release of the thyroid cartilage horn, release of the piriform sinus. Subsequent right-sided release of the piriform sinus. Caudal free dissection of the trachea and the cricoid cartilage. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus and exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Release of the hyoid and preservation of the surrounding musculature. Entering the vallecula. Extension of the pharyngotomy. Resection of the specimen along the aryepiglottic folds. Now a good overview of the tumor, which adheres to the right or anteriorly to the thyroid cartilage and infiltrates it. The laryngeal musculature on the right side is not perforated, but all soft tissue is left on the specimen as described above, so that a safe in sano resection is achieved in the anterior region. Postcricoid resection sparing the mucosa. Release of the piriform sinus. In the case of inital subglottic expansion, resection of the first tracheal clasp and removal of the preparation. As suspected, this shows a clear subglottic expansion with growth approx. 1.5 cm below the glottic level, but here too a safe in sano resection. Also on the specimen in sano resection with here also supraglottic expansion in the area of the petiolus and the beginning laryngeal epiglottis area. To confirm the R0 situation in the area of the mucosa covering the margins as well as in the area of the tracheal margin. No higher-grade dysplasia or tumor is found here, meaning that a safe R0 resection has been achieved. The anterior wall of the trachea is then resected. A Provox prosthesis of size 8 mm is placed at the cranial tracheal margin. The two-layer inverted closure of the pharyngeal defect is then performed under wide and strong mucosal conditions. Overall intact conditions. This is followed by transection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle insertions close to the stone on both sides. Subsequent wound inspection and wound irrigation and, if the wound was completely dry, insertion of two size 10 Redon drains and subsequent insertion of the tracheostoma as well as careful two-layer wound closure and finally reintubation with a size 10 low cuff cannula and completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Note: The patient received 3 g Unacid intraoperatively; please continue this for 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT4a cN0 G3 glottic laryngeal carcinoma with thyroid cartilage perforation and both supra- and subglottic extension. In the absence of clinical signs of a pharyngeal fistula, please perform a postoperative X-ray pre-swallow on the 8th to 9th postoperative day.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy

Intubation transnasally by the anesthesia colleagues. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the hypopharynx, piriform sinus and postcricoid region. No abnormalities here. Attempt to adjust the tumor, which can be seen on the left side in the area of the glottis and supraglottis. Adjustment of the tumor is extremely difficult as the adjustability is very low. CT morphologically, the tumor breaks through the thyroid cartilage. Placement of a nasogastric tube. Repositioning for PEG insertion. Entering with the flexible esophagoscope and advancing into the stomach. Insertion of a PEG using the thread pull-through method. With good diaphanoscopy, this can be done without any problems. Sterile washing and draping. Creation of an apron flap. Preparation of the platysma. Raising and fixation of the apron flap. Start with the neck dissection on the left side. Here you can see a large rough metastasis which macroscopically infiltrates far into the sternocleidomastoid. Therefore, expose the sternocleidomastoid and the submandibular gland, the omohyoid muscle and remove the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the caudal region. Raise the muscle and dissect along the cervical vascular sheath in a cranial direction. It can be clearly seen that the internal jugular vein has a very small caliber, so that it can be assumed that the tumor has also penetrated the vein. This also becomes clear on further dissection. The vein is therefore clamped and cut in the caudal area and the ends are ligated. Further dissection cranially along the external and internal carotid artery. The metastasis can be easily pushed away from these vessels. The metastasis also infiltrates the posterior digastric venter muscle. This is also partially removed. The hypoglossal nerve can be spared and the facial vein must unfortunately also be removed. Removal of the metastasis and removal of the legal neck block II a to V a, sparing the plexus branches, whereby it must be said that the accessorius nerve and the cranial plexus branches were also partially resected, as these have penetrated directly into the metastasis. Turning to the opposite side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid, digastric and submandibular gland and exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein, the facial vein and removal of the neck levels II a to V a, while sparing the plexus branches. Detachment of the neck vessels from the pharynx and larynx area. Exposure of the hyoid bone. Detachment of the base of the tongue from the hyoid bone. Skeletonization of the larynx with detachment of the oblique laryngeal musculature. Entering the pharynx, just above the hyoid bone. Pulling out the epiglottis and cutting along the epiglottis to the postcricoid region, initially on the right side. Inspection of the tumor region. This breaks through the thyroid cartilage ventrally and also laterally on the left. A great deal of tissue is left in the ventral and lateral region of the laryngeal preparation. The thyroid gland is difficult to dissect and is therefore sharply dissected to avoid getting into the tumor. Further dissection of the laryngeal preparation and removal of the larynx below the cricoid cartilage. Before this, a tracheostoma was created and the ventilation tube was intubated. Removal of a resected specimen with a marginal sample from the thyroid gland area, as the tumor is at least very close here macroscopically. The marginal sample from the thyroid gland is tumor-free. The laryngeal specimen is sent for final histology. Insertion of a Provox prosthesis in the usual manner with the auxiliary trocar, approx. 1 cm below the upper edge of the tracheostoma. A myotomy of the esophageal sphincter is omitted, as this could be passed loosely with a transverse finger. Perform a myotomy in the sternocleidomastoid muscle to achieve a flat stoma. Performing the pharyngeal suture in a three-layered manner with single button sutures, without creating a T.

An attempt is first made to intubate bronchoscopically. This is not possible due to the large tumor masses. The bronchoscope cannot pass through the tumor masses and the glottis. Therefore withdrawal and decision for tracheotomy in LA. Ultracaine is injected in the tracheotomy area. Then a skin incision is made slightly below the cricoid cartilage, dissected in depth down to the prelaryngeal muscles. This is pushed to the side. Then dissection down to the thyroid gland. Exposure of the thyroid gland. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea and entry into the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Insertion of a laryngectomy tube and repositioning in preparation for surgery. Then sterile washing and draping. Creation of an apron flap in the usual manner, while protecting the platysma. Start with neck dissection/tumor resection on the left side. This reveals a very large metastasis that initially appears to be attached to the larynx and merges into the tumor per continuitatem. This metastasis is first detached from the cervical vascular sheath. It can be seen that the internal jugular vein runs directly into the metastasis. This must be cut off. The common carotid artery, the external carotid artery and the internal carotid artery can be detached from the metastasis, as can the vagus nerve. Most of the sternocleidomastoid muscle must also be removed, but the outer layers of the muscle can be preserved and the accessorius nerve also preserved, as there is clearly no tumor infiltration here. Exposure of the hyoid bone. Then release of the larynx and detachment of the cervical vascular sheath, also on the right side. Detachment of the suprahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone and opening of the pharynx at the exact point of the epiglottis. Pull out the epiglottis and incise the pharynx downwards along the free edge of the epiglottis. The tumor can be easily palpated macroscopically and the tumor is resected up to the posterior side of the pharynx, leaving a sufficient safety margin in the pharynx. Then release the piriform sinus on the right side and complete the tumor resection and laryngectomy by cutting around the pharynx and piriform sinus from the opposite side. Then the laryngeal preparation is also removed posteriorly below the cricoid cartilage so that a good tongue-shaped flap can remain on the posterior wall of the trachea. Now demonstrate the entire preparation on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and also on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. It is recommended not to perform a flapplasty as sufficient mucosal tissue is present. Due to the good safety distance, it is possible to take margin samples directly from the specimen without any problems. The specimen is completely covered by margin samples and cut around. The pathologist classifies everything in the frozen section as R0. Then insertion of a voice valve prosthesis in the usual manner by creating a tracheoesophageal fistula using the trocar provided for this purpose. The voice valve prosthesis is then inserted using the pull-through method and the edges are carefully rolled out. The Provox prosthesis is positioned approx. 1 cm below the tracheostoma. Now perform the pharyngeal suture in the usual way, starting at the top at the base of the tongue. Then switch to the distal area and place the 1st suture, then place the 2nd suture. Then complete the neck dissection in level V on the left side. Then perform the modified radical neck dissection on the right side levels II to IV using <CLINICIAN_NAME>. For this, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is further released, the accessorius is exposed, the hypoglossus is exposed, the neck preparation is released from the neck vessel sheath and removed. Now perform the 3rd safety suture, fixation of the constrictor pharyngeal muscle. Finally, incision and completion of the tracheostoma with formation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis. Two Redon drains were inserted and a two-layer wound closure was made. Please X-ray pap smear examination after 10 days, then, if there is no fistula, problem-free, step-by-step diet reconstruction and presentation of the patient to the tumor conference to plan adjuvant therapy.","Partial pharyngectomy with laryngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Provox

As described above, an approx. 3 x 2 cm large mass can be seen in the right hypopharynx, which was positively biopsied as a squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor appears to be resectable by lateral pharyngotomy. The PEG is now initially inserted: the esophagoscope is inserted into the stomach. Due to the thickness of the subcutaneous layer, conditions are much more difficult. Nevertheless, a clear diaphanoscopy can now be seen when pressure is applied with the finger. Clear conditions under sonographic control. No liver or intestinal loops in the abdominal wall. Placement of the PEG with the thread pull-through method in the usual way. No bleeding. Primary wound dressing on the abdomen. Intraoperative administration of 250 mg SDH. Now infiltration anesthesia in the area of the right neck. First incision of a platysmal flap and careful dissection of the platysma further cranially. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is also exposed in depth. Further dissection of the platysmal flap over the submandibular gland in a cranial direction. Now dissection of the internal jugular vein and facial vein in depth. Very difficult dissection conditions. A large metastasis infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle. For this reason, part of the muscle must be sharply separated from the metastasis. Finally, the internal jugular vein can be freed from the metastasis. Deep dissection of the vagus nerve and the external and internal carotid arteries as well as the accessorius nerve. Expose the posterior digastric venter muscle. Now complete the posterior neck by clearing out the accessorius triangle and dissecting the mass caudally to supraclavicular. Separate the soft tissue there and cut around it. Finally, dissection of the venous angle. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Removal of the capsule of the submandibular gland. The previously described metastasis is now also completely separated from the facial vein. The vein remains intact. Dissection of the superior thyroid artery and completion of the neck preparation on the right with removal of all soft tissue and lymph nodes. Now proceed to the left.

Now dissect the posterior neck preparation from cranial to caudal. Protect the cervical plexus. Set down caudally after repositioning. Now dissect the submandibular gland. Remove the capsule. Dissection of the hypoglossal nerve and completion of the neck preparation anteriorly, including the capsule of the submandibular gland and the soft tissue in front of and above the common carotid artery. Perform the tracheotomy. Median skin incision for this. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and the infrahyoid musculature. Difficult dissection conditions due to the very deep larynx. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining, cutting through and perforating it. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a Björk flap and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Relatively high tension due to the deep trachea. Re-intubation of the patient. Now turn back to the tumor side on the right and skeletonize the larynx on the right side or the thyroid cartilage. Enter the pharynx. The tumor becomes visible. This is also clinically incised in healthy tissue. It reaches up to the arytenoid cusp. Extremely difficult dissection conditions here. It is finally possible to resect the entire tumor from cranial to caudal, including part of the larynx and half of the thyroid cartilage on the right. Removal of marginal samples. These are found to be tumor-free. Extensive hemostasis with H2O2 and bipolar coagulation. Now perform the pharyngeal suture. The previously prepared platysmal flap is not required. Primary wound closure can be performed. Invert the sutures from caudal to cranial. Multi-layer wound closure. Mobilize the right thyroid gland and suture the thyroid gland over the pharyngeal suture again. Extensive hemostasis in the area of the right neck. Irrigation with H2O2.

Base of tongue not infiltrated macroscopically. Overall indication for laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy, if necessary with flap coverage. Sterile draping and injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck follows. Then lift an apron flap in the typical manner up to the submandibular gland on both sides and subplatysmal at the level of the hyoid bone. Then neck dissection on the left: Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein and external and internal carotid arteries. Exposure of the accessory nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve. Clearing level II to V. Here also visualization and preservation of the branches of the cervical plexus. Macroscopically no clear evidence of lymph node involvement. Subsequent right neck dissection Level II to V: Identification and visualization of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissection down to depth. Identification of the omohyoid muscle. Dissection along the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid bone. Now cranial identification of the digastric muscle and detachment of the submandibular gland from the glandular capsule. Now identify the accessorius nerve. The nerve is safely spared and dissected free from the neck preparation. Also identification of the hypoglossal nerve. Sharp dissection along the V. jugularis interna and lateral tapping of the neck preparation. Now free the cervical vascular nerve sheath from the neck preparation. The carotid artery, vagus nerve and jugular vein must be safely identified and protected. Now remove the neck preparation in the usual manner from cranial to caudal while sparing the deep plexus branches. Completion of the neck dissection on the right side without complications. Subsequent laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy: first exposing the hyoid bone and separating it from the suprahyoid musculature. Pre-epiglottic fatty tissue is included in the resection. Exposure of the left superior cornu and exposure of the laryngeal skeleton. Hypopharynx remains on the laryngeal skeleton. Caudal dissection of the thyroid gland. Subsequent isolation of the right superior cornu, dissection of the hypopharynx from the laryngeal skeleton. Caudal dissection of the thyroid gland. Subsequent entry into the larynx, initially from the right paramedian side. Exposure of the tumor. Cut around the tumor macroscopically with a safety margin of at least 1 to 1.5 cm. The larynx is integrated into the resection. Caudal dissection of the larynx from the distal hypopharynx or esophageal entrance. Deposition of the larynx above the tracheostoma. Prior to this, preparation of a mucosal flap from the cricoid cartilage, which is dissected off here and sutured to the tracheal cartilage remaining cranial to the tracheostoma. This creates a Hermann ridge. Sutures with 3 or 4-0 Vicryl. The larynx is marked with sutures. In the area from the middle of the base of the tongue to the left pharyngeal wall, a further marginal sample is obtained and also marked with sutures; this is sent to the frozen section. The frozen section still shows carcinoma in situ infiltrates in the area of the middle of the tongue base and moderate dysplasia in the area of the left pharyngeal wall. Therefore, another 1 cm resection was taken from the base of the tongue, which extended to the left pharyngeal wall. No more infiltrates in the tumor-free part in the frozen section. However, there is still moderate dysplasia at several edges, no further surgical measures in the case of suspected field carcinomatization. Myotomy on the left in the typical manner and insertion of a size 8 provox prosthesis in the typical manner. Subsequent suturing of the hypopharynx, partly continuous, partly inverting single button sutures. Subsequently 2nd suture inverted over the 1st suture. Further inverting sutures are made, particularly in the area of the base of the tongue. Then 3rd suture of the musculature over the 2nd suture, also with Vicryl 4-0 single button sutures. A gastric tube was inserted as a splint before pharyngeal closure. Subsequently, careful irrigation of the wound area with hemostasis and layered wound closure with insertion of a Redon drainage in both sides of the neck. The tracheostoma was also epithelialized. Subsequent completion of the procedure without complications. Patient received preoperative antibiotics with Unacid. Please continue this antibiotic treatment for one week.

There is a history of alcohol and nicotine abuse. A sample was taken in the panendoscopy <2016>. This revealed a P16 negative G3 squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.,"Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesiology colleagues, then the PEG is inserted first. For this purpose, the flexible oesophagogastroscope is used to enter the stomach. The mucosa is unremarkable. If the diaphanoscopy is good, the PEG is inserted using the thread pull-through method without complications. Repositioning and insertion of the spandex and a covered wound blocker. Inspection of the tumor region. The tumor is located in the area of the glossotonsillar groove on the left, merges into the base of the tongue, merges onto the alveolar ridge of the lower jaw and merges into the lateral floor of the mouth. Now snare the tongue and start resecting the tumor in the tongue area with the monopolar needle. The tumor is cut around the edge of the tongue up to the base of the tongue. The tumor is then cut around in the area of the floor of the mouth and the side wall of the pharynx. Then push the tumor away from the lower jaw in the area of the alveolar ridge. This was successful without any problems. Extension of the resection in the area of the glossotonsillar groove. Although the mouth opening is very small, it is possible to resect the tumor completely transorally with maximum relaxation and opening of the mouth. The tumor is retrieved en bloc. Subsequent resections are performed in the area where the tumor is macroscopically close to the resection margins. At the end, marginal samples are taken and the tumor specimen is sent in thread-marked. All marginal samples are free of tumor, carcinoma and dysplasia in the frozen section. Now measure the defect and proceed to neck dissection. At the same time, the radialis graft is lifted by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Lifting of the radialis flap using <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Marking of the graft in the presence of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Skin incision along the previously defined flap boundaries and S-shaped skin incision into the antecubital fossa. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue, initially in the area of the flap pedicle down to the forearm fascia. Identification of the superficial cutaneous veins. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein. It can be seen that the vein can be included in the skin graft on the radial side. After inspecting the superficial venous situation, the forearm fascia is incised along the flexor carpi radialis muscle and the brachioradialis muscle in a distal direction. The forearm fascia is then incised in the area of the flap edges. In this case, the ulnar fascia is first dissected subfascially, leaving the peritendineum and perimysium of the adjacent muscles and tendons of the forearm intact. Identification of the ulnar artery. This can be left uninjured without any problems. Distal skin incision through the forearm fascia and subfascial dissection up to the anterior edge of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Radial incision with inclusion of the cephalic vein in the graft. Here too, subfascial dissection is performed up to the anterior edge of the brachioradialis muscle. Particular care is taken here to preserve the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Identification of the distal radial artery. Undermining of the radial artery with the clamp and clamping of the artery. After clamping the radial artery, there is no decrease in oxygen saturation (measured on the index finger). After approx. 5 minutes, the distal radial artery is severed and the stumps are supplied with a bypass ligature. The radial artery flap is now lifted from the depth alternately from the radial and ulnar side along the septum under constant bleeding control using the bipolar coagulation forceps and clip supply. After insertion of a proximal retractor between the muscle bellies of the .............................. carpi radialis and brachioradialis muscles, the flap pedicle is also dissected. The radial nerve can be spared here. The radial nerve can be spared. Dissection is carried out up to the confluence of the veins and up to the exit of the interosseous artery. The artery is also clamped with a clip for a few minutes. Here, too, there is no decrease in oxygen saturation (measured on the index finger). Once the interosseous artery has been ligated and ligated, the flap can be lifted without any problems. The wound is closed in two layers in the area of the S-shaped skin incision on the flap pedicle and split skin is sutured in the area of the former skin flap. The split skin is sutured in place with Ethilon 5.0 in single button sutures. Exposed tendons are covered with muscle tissue beforehand. Preparation swabs are attached to the split skin with deep skin sutures to fix the split skin graft to the substrate. This is followed by the application of a wound dressing with absorbent cotton and the application of a dorsal splint in a slightly extended position of the wrist as well as the application of a flexible bandage. Completion of flap elevation without complications. Start with neck dissection on the left side. Skin incision in a transverse skin fold. Exposure of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. Overall difficult preparation conditions as the neck is very voluminous and short. Exposure of the nervus accessorius and the cervical vascular sheath. The hypoglossal nerve and the lingual artery were already removed during the tumor resection. Now remove the neck specimen II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. This causes the internal jugular vein to tear due to traction. This is carefully sutured over so that further flow is possible. As an anatomical variation, the facial vein emerges directly from the external jugular vein and the internal jugular vein has no further outlets in the area of the aforementioned level. Now remove the submandibular gland and clear level I b. Cut through the digastric muscle and create an enoral tunnel so that 3 transverse fingers can fit through. Now turn to the neck dissection on the opposite side. Here also skin incision in a transverse skin fold. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. Then evacuation of neck levels II a to V a, sparing the plexus branches and hypoglossal nerve and the accessorius and cervical nerves. Here, too, the internal jugular vein is torn by hook traction. The entire venous tissue is extremely fragile. Unfortunately, it is not possible to close the tear of the internal jugular vein on the right side by suturing it over. Recall from <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Ultimately, the internal jugular vein must be completely closed above an outlet and ligated. Then insertion of Tabotamp and completion of the neck dissection. Dissection of the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein and external jugular vein for flap connection. Removal of the radialis graft. It can be seen that although there is a good radial artery on the radialis graft itself, the venous situation is extremely critical. There are 2 tiny concomitant veins and a slender venous confluence between the superficial and deep system. In the end, the decision is made to use the radialis graft anyway. It is now sutured in place by placing sutures in the deep area of the oropharynx in the area of the base of the tongue and the side wall of the pharynx. The graft is then successively retracted and finally sutured in the area of the soft palate, the cheek and the anterior part of the edge of the tongue. The stalk is transferred to the right side and anastomosed with the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein and a further outlet from the facial vein. In the meantime, the tracheotomy was performed using the visor technique. At the end, a Redon drain was inserted on the left side and a flap on the right side. The patient went to the intensive care unit on a ventilator and was to continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours. The patient's diet should be resumed from the 14th postoperative day at the earliest.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Reconstruction, Free flap (Radial)

This is not possible due to the tumor masses. Therefore quick decision to perform an emergency tracheotomy. Brief washing and injection of ultracaine mixture. Skin incision in the usual manner just below the inguinal cartilage. Rapid dissection in depth. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation. Exposure of the thyroid gland. Undermining of the thyroid gland. Bipolar coagulation of the thyroid gland and transection of the isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Entering the trachea below the cricoid cartilage and intubation with a laryngectomy tube. Transfer for PEG insertion: insertion with the flexible oesophagoscope and pre-scanning into the stomach. If diaphanoscopy is good, perform the PEG insertion using the thread pull-through method. Enter with the small water tube and inspect the hypopharynx and larynx: The hypopharynx itself is unremarkable. Adjustment of the larynx. Here, an exophytic growing tumor can be seen on the right side with an inconspicuous epiglottis, which completely fills the endolarynx and extends to the other side. The vocal fold plane and pocket folds are no longer visible. The piriform sinus is free on both sides. Sterile washing and draping. Marking of the skin incision. Creation of an apron flap. The platysma is extremely thin and so is the skin. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland, the accessorius nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein and excavation of neck levels II to V while sparing the plexus branches. Turning to the opposite side. Identical procedure. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland, accessorius nerve, lingual nerve. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and removal of the neck block II to V while sparing the plexus branches. Very little fatty tissue and no conspicuous lymph nodes are visible on either side. Level VI is integrated into the respective sides. Detachment of the cervical vascular sheath from the larynx. Skeletonization of the larynx with exposure of the hyoid bone and detachment of the infrahyal musculature. On the left side and in the middle, the musculature is left on the larynx preparation, as a thyroid cartilage perforation is described in the CT. Exposure of the upper horn of the thyroid cartilage on both sides and release of the piriform sinus. Enter the pharynx at the level of the hyoid bone and pull out the epiglottis. Cut along the edges of the epiglottis in a postcricoid direction while protecting the piriform sinus on both sides. Release of the postcricoid region and removal of the larynx below the cricoid cartilage. It can be clearly seen that the tumor does not extend far into the subglottic region and that the mucosa of the cricoid cartilage is inconspicuous at this point. To be on the safe side, a marginal sample was taken from the pharyngeal area at the pharyngo-epiglottic fold and sent in for a frozen section, as the resection margins were very narrow here. Pathology revealed no invasive carcinoma, no carcinoma in situ and no dysplasia. The esophageal myotomy was performed posteromedially on the left side so that a QF could be passed without any problems. Perform a myotomy on the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides to create a wide tracheostoma. Insertion of a Provox prosthesis 1 cm below the tracheostoma posterior edge in the usual manner. Incision of the tracheostoma initially at the front. Perform the pharyngeal suture in the usual manner. Fold back the apron flap and integrate it into the tracheostoma. Insertion of two Redon drains. Two-layer wound closure. The patient goes to the intensive care unit ventilated. Please carry out an X-ray pre-swallow 10 days postoperatively. Until then, the nasogastric tube remains in place as a splint. Unacid 1.5 g for 24 hours.","Laryngectomy, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement

The tumor also infiltrates the base of the tongue. Then change to the transcervical region. Skin incision in the area of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid. Exposure of the lower part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein in the lower part. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Then transection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, because the N3 neck metastasis infiltrates the upper part of the muscle and also the vein. Then removal of the internal jugular vein. Dissection of the tumor from the internal carotid artery. The external carotid artery must also be removed due to tumor infiltration. In addition, superficial plexus branches and the accessorius nerve must also be removed, as well as the hypoglossal nerve and the submandibular gland. Level I also contains large, conspicuous nodes. Level I is therefore also removed. The tendon of the omohyoid muscle, which is also infiltrated, is severed. The caudal part of the parotid gland is also infiltrated and the oral branch must also be resected. The tumor is in direct contact with the N3 neck metastasis, but is not completely connected to it, so it is possible to remove the metastasis separately from the tumor and also the remaining neck tissue. The tumor is then pulled outwards from the transcervical area and resected. The result is a fairly large, three-dimensional defect from the vallecula up to the soft palate. The defect is then measured and the graft designed. The graft is designed so that it is 17 cm long and has an angled section for tongue reconstruction, which is also approx. 8 to 9 cm in size. This graft is then lifted by <CLINICIAN_NAME> on the arm. Mark the graft for this purpose. Skin incision. Visualization of the vascular situation in the crook of the elbow and the vascular pedicle. Exposure of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve, which is divided into 2 branches. One branch is severed by <CLINICIAN_NAME> due to the size of the graft. However, the main branch remains intact. Now change the operators from <CLINICIAN_NAME> to <CLINICIAN_NAME> and complete the graft elevation. To do this, lift the graft from the tendon bed. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle and preparation of the pedicle in the usual manner. Then further dissection of the vascular situation in the crook of the elbow and removal of the graft while preserving 3 venous vessels. Marking of the radial artery. Now conditioning of the vessels in the neck area. The stump of the internal jugular vein is already thrombosed, as is the stump of the external jugular vein. This is no longer an option for the transplant. An accompanying vein in the area of the omohyoid is prepared. The stump of the external artery is also already occluded and is no longer suitable as a connecting vessel. The superior thyroid artery is therefore prepared and conditioned. Now fitting the graft into the defect and suturing the graft, mostly transcervically. This is extremely difficult because the graft is very large and very bulky and also because of the considerable swelling in the palate, uvula and tongue. In the end, the graft was able to fit completely. Now the vessels are anastomosed, first the arterial and then the venous vessels. Only one venous vessel can be connected, as the other two do not show any blood return; they are clipped. A flap is then inserted and the wound is closed in two layers. Parallel to the graft elevation, the neck is dissected on the left side, initially through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Representation of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Clearing of the medial neck block with preservation of the facial vein and artery. Exposure of level IIa with preservation of the accessorius nerve. Then transfer of <CLINICIAN_NAME> and removal of neck levels II b to V a while preserving the plexus branches. Insertion of a Redon drainage, two-layer wound closure. Then perform the tracheotomy through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Make a skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection down to the musculature. Splitting of the musculature in the linea alba. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Entering the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis and reintubation on an 8 mm tube. A flap is inserted in the area of the right side of the neck and a two-layer wound closure is performed. The patient goes to IOI intubated and ventilated due to heart and lung problems. Please perform an X-ray gruel swallow on the 10th postoperative day. Continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours.","Tumor resection, Left neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

The above-mentioned intervention is therefore indicated for treatment.,"First, pharyngoscopy and MLE again: The exophytic tumor is visible, which starts at the palatal arch next to the uvula on the left, extends over the tonsillar lobe to the base of the tongue. In the area of the pharyngeal side wall up to the edge of the posterior wall. The tumor shows exulcerative character and deep growth. Therefore primary indication for combined resection. Sterile draping and injection of a total of 20 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline in the area of both sides of the neck. Start with transoral resection: Cut around the tumor with a safety margin of 1 ˝ to 2 cm on all sides, initially from the enoral side. Smaller parts of the palatal arch on the right, the uvula, the entire palatal arch on the left, mucosa along the alveolar ridge up to the glossoalveolar groove and the beginning of the tongue base, pharyngeal posterior wall falls to the middle, caudally the resection extends from the transoral side to the entrance of the piriform sinus. Then repositioning for neck dissection on the right with subsequent completion of the resection from transcervical: submandibular incision. Cut along the sternocleidomastoid muscle caudally. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Showing digastric muscle, submandibular gland. Showing the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein, external and internal carotid artery. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Successive evacuation level I b to V. Co-resection of the submandibular gland. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. The facial artery is ligated cranially in preparation for tumor resection. The transoral resection is then completed by transcervical resection: the entire pharyngeal wall is included up to the cervical vascular sheath. A portion of the base of the tongue is resected caudally as well as the mucosa up to the piriform sinus entrance and all soft tissue up to the cornu superius or hyoid bone. In total, marginal samples are taken from the palatal arch, laterally to the alveolar ridge, from the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall. In addition, a cranial basal margin sample and a caudal basal margin sample are taken. All marginal samples are sent to frozen section diagnostics with the tumor specimen, which is marked with a thread. In the frozen section, all margin samples are tumor-free, as is the specimen. Thus R0 situation intraoperatively. Subsequent left neck dissection and tracheotomy (<CLINICIAN_NAME>). Neck dissection left: Skin incision. Then exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Visualization of the cervical vascular sheath. Level II shows several lymph node metastases, which are removed while sparing the vessels of the jugular vein, the external and internal carotid arteries and while sparing and exposing the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Then further successive evacuation of levels I, III and V. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery and facial artery. Then repositioning for tracheotomy. Skin incision in the usual manner. Dissection of the musculature. Push the muscles to the side and expose the thyroid gland. Undermining of the thyroid gland and clamping on both sides. Then transection of the isthmus and ligation on both sides. Exposure of the trachea. Opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage gap. Omission of a Björk flap and epithelialization of the skin. Insertion of a laryngectomy tube, which was later intubated with a tracheal cannula. The radial flap is then removed: first the size and dimensions of the flap are measured at the situs. Maximum length 14 cm, maximum width 9 cm. The size and dimensions of the flap are marked on the forearm. Flap elevation is performed without tourniquet. Saturation at the beginning 100%. Cut around the flap first from the ulnar, then from the radial side. Extension of the incision curved in the direction of the crook of the elbow. Subfascial elevation of the flap successively. Exposure of the flap pedicle below the brachioradialis. Previously, the superficial venous outflow was also exposed above it. The radial artery was visualized and clamped for 20 minutes. There was no deterioration in saturation, which was always 100%. Subsequently, the radial artery was removed and treated with 4-0 Prolene stitches caudally and cranially. Flap is successively lifted subfascially, smaller vessels are coagulated bipolarly or supplied with clips. Lifting of the flap pedicle up to the elbow. Exposure of the radial artery, brachial artery, ulnar artery and interosseous artery. Also show the radial vein and the superficial venous outflow, which ends in 2 branches in the area of the cephalic vein. There is a stable connection to the deep venous system. Subsequent removal of the flap, ligation of the veins, removal of the radial artery before the interosseous outlet. Here clip and stitch sutures with 4-0 Prolene. Flap is irrigated with heparin. Subsequent insertion of the flap into the defect: The flap is inserted into the defect according to the size and shape lifted. The flap pedicle is inserted caudally below the preserved hypoglossal nerve on the left and passed through a previously created tunnel to the right side. Successive suturing of the flap, partly with sutures in the defect. Tension-free, anatomically correct suturing is achieved. Subsequent anastomosis of the vessels on the right side: conditioning of the radial artery and the superior thyroid artery. These are sutured using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and very good venous return. Subsequent conditioning of the radial vein and cephalic vein. Also conditioning of a small outlet from the facial vein and the external jugular vein. The smaller radial vein is anastomosed to the outlet from the facial vein using a 1.5 mm coupler. The cephalic vein is also anastomosed with the external jugular vein using a second coupler size 3.5 mm. Good venous return in each case. Positive smear phenomenon. Flap very well perfused intraoperatively. Subsequent irrigation of the wound area, careful hemostasis. Layered wound closure with insertion of a Redon drain in each case. The position of the anastomosis in the area of the external jugular vein is marked. Then insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula, which is fixed with sutures. Defect coverage of the forearm using inguinal skin from the right: An appropriately sized piece of full-thickness skin is removed from the groin area in the typical manner. The inguinal skin is mobilized accordingly and then closed in several layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. Skin sutures using the Donati technique. Full-thickness skin is then thinned out and successively sutured into the defect on the caudal forearm. This is done without tension. The upper sections of the wound on the forearm are closed in layers in the typical manner. A hydrogel-Mepilex dressing is then applied, followed by a loose compress dressing and wrapping in absorbent cotton. Fitting of a Kramer splint and wrapping in an elastic bandage. The procedure is completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics, which were started preoperatively, for a total of 1 week. Heparin perfusor 500 units per hour for 5 days. Flap control in typical clinical manner and by means of Doppler control for 5 days. Total cT3 cN2c oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left. R0 resection intraoperatively. Postoperatively, due to the overall situation, RCT to be discussed. Feeding via a PEG tube for 10 days, then control of swallowing of gruel and diet build-up.","Transcervical resection, Pharyngoscopy, MLE (Microlaryngoscopy and Endoscopy), Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial)

Sonography shows a roundish nodus on the left in level II, but only 5 mm, therefore cN1 neck status is possible in principle. The primary tumor cannot be delineated on computed tomography; there are unspecific, most likely reactive, enlarged lymph nodes on both sides, no evidence of lung metastases. There is therefore now an indication for the above-mentioned operation.","First induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. Then tracheoscopy and intubation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. This reveals an inconspicuous mucosa up to the caudal carina. Subsequent inspection and palpation of the tongue, base of tongue, tonsil lobe and soft palate. A slight induration is palpated on the front of the soft palate on the left side, just above the upper alveolar ridge, measuring just under 1 cm2 on inspection. The tongue, base of the tongue and floor of the mouth are inconspicuous on palpation. Now insert the size C Kleinsasser tube. Mirror forward into the piriform sinus, which can be freely unfolded on both sides. The postcricoid region, interaryngeal region and endolarynx are inconspicuous. The esophagogastroscopy was then performed. This is completely unremarkable. Now proceed to tumor excision. Insert the Mc Ivor oral spatula for this. Marking of the subsequent resectate borders using a monopolar and subsequent monopolar incision around the tumor. Subsequent cold dissection in depth and removal of the tumor, which appears to be growing on the surface. Marking at 12 o'clock short short and at 9 o'clock median short long and sending for frozen section. Subtle hemostasis and positioning of the patient for neck dissection. Injection of 10 ml xylocaine with adrenaline in the area of the subsequent skin incision. Then abjode and sterile draping of the surgical field. Now start with the skin incision on the mastoid, curving forward to caudal to supraclavicular. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure of the auricularis magnus nerve and the external jugular vein. Ligation of the external jugular vein and protection of the auricular nerve. Subsequent exposure of the platysma and separate dissection. Exposure of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle from caudal to cranial. Subsequently, cranial preparation on the capsule of the submandibular gland and removal or tapping caudally of the capsule in the anterior neck preparation. Dissection on the digaster venter posteriorly and dissection anteriorly. Then caudal dissection of the omohyoid muscle with dissection anteriorly and union with the anterior neck preparation cranially. Subsequent dissection of the lateral neck preparation. Free preparation of the vein with removal of the outer leaf and tapping into the neck preparation. Develop the neck preparation from caudal to cranial. In doing so, protect the cervical plexus. The common carotid artery is dissected in depth and the vagus nerve is exposed. Further dissection in a cranial direction. Exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve. Dissection of level IIb. Detachment of the lateral neck preparation in toto. Subsequent detachment of the previously dissected anterior neck preparation. Subtle hemostasis, followed by insertion of a Redon drain, subcutaneous and platysma suture with 5-0 Ethilon. Subsequent transition to enoral resection after the frozen section revealed that the squamous cell carcinoma was resected at 9 o'clock with less than 1 mm in sano, but the carcinoma in situ was margin-forming at the same site. Therefore, resection from 12 o'clock median to after 6 o'clock on a width of approx. 0.5 cm and removal of a margin sample. Both are sent for final histology. Subtle hemostasis and termination of the operation at this point without complications. Conclusion: Squamous cell carcinoma cT1 oral cavity soft palate anterior left side removed in sano in a frozen section. However, here carcinoma in situ forming a margin, a resection and a margin sample were removed, these were sent for final histology.

Overview and adjustability not optimal, therefore external surgery indicated.","Once again, the size C and D small bore tube is used. The tumor is visible from the middle third to just before the commissure. Overall setting suboptimal. Therefore, resection from the outside. Repositioning for laryngeal resection: injection of a total of 8 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline in the prelaryngeal area. Sterile draping after skin disinfection. Z-shaped skin incision. Subsequent exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. This is split medially or dissected to the side. Exposure of the laryngeal skeleton. Formation of a soft tissue perichondrium flap, which is started parapharyngeally on the left and dissected over the front edge of the larynx. Subsequent thyrotomy. Opening of the larynx. The tumor can be seen from the front and reaches just in front of the commissure. Due to the proximity, a small, triangular piece of cartilage is removed from the right side. The perichondrium is then pushed away from the cartilage on the right over the entire length of the vocal fold. This is due to the deep infiltration of the tumor. No breakthrough through the perichondrium. Resection of the vocal fold up to the processus vocalis of the arytenoid cartilage, also including parts of the pocket fold, as the tumor grows somewhat into the ventriculus laryngeus. The tumor is then removed in a specimen. Suture marking. A marginal sample is taken from the left front at the transition to the left vocal fold, another marginal sample from the arytenoid region. Subsequent careful hemostasis. In the frozen section, both tumor and marginal samples in healthy tissue, thus R0 resection. The left vocal fold is now refixed to the cartilage using a 4-0 Vicryl suture. Subsequently, the most careful hemostasis again, no bleeding for a long time after hemostasis and Suprarenin swab insertion. Then suturing of the thyroid cartilage using Vicryl 3-0 sutures. Repositioning of the perichondrium soft tissue flap and suturing to the opposite side with 4-0 Vicryl single-button sutures. Complete closure. Subsequent suturing of the infrahyoid musculature using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. This with insertion of a flap. Subsequent layered wound closure. Followed by a light pressure bandage. The procedure was completed without complications. Overall cT1 laryngeal carcinoma, more cT1a than b, but with some proximity to the anterior commissure. Due to the less than optimal overview, resection from the outside. Please arrange another check-up or follow-up MLE in 8 to 12 months.","Partial laryngeal resection according to Leroux-Robert

For this reason, a panendo and sampling of the left vocal fold had already been performed externally in <LOCATION>. A moderately differentiated partially keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the left vocal fold was diagnosed. The patient had 40 pack years and consumed 3 beers per week. There is an indication for the above-mentioned operation.","Transfer of the patient to the operating theater and positioning of the patient. Consultation with the anesthesiologist. Start with inspection of the oral mucosa. This is non-irritating and inconspicuous. The tonsils and base of the tongue are also palpable and clinically unremarkable. The lateral and posterior walls of the pharynx are also unremarkable, as are the cricoid region and both piriform sinuses. The left vocal fold shows a whitish, exophytic mass over the entire length of the vocal fold. Reinke's edema can also be seen. The mass is carefully cut around with the CO2 laser. A swab on the tube protects the cuff, which remains intact. A sufficient safety margin was left anteriorly at the anterior commissure. If the patient is difficult to adjust, it is necessary to switch between the small bore tube C and D and to readjust the tumor several times. However, complete resection of the tumor is possible without any problems. Dorsally, the resection margin extends to the vocalis process, basally to the vocalis muscle. The vocalis muscle can be identified as tumor-free muscle tissue. There is no increased bleeding after resection. Now take 3 marginal samples. These are taken dorsally at the vocal process, basally at the vocalis muscle and caudally at the sedimentation margin or subglottic slope. Insertion of a suprarenal swab. All these marginal samples are tumor-free. Removal of the swab. If there is no bleeding, the operation is ended. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist. Conclusion: The patient has a cT1a glottic carcinoma of the left vocal fold. The final histology should be awaited, the marginal samples were clear today. A follow-up MLE is recommended in 8 weeks.","Laser resection, Panendoscopy

Preoperative extent determined. Tumor extends from the anterior palatal arch over the pharyngeal wall into the base of the tongue on the right. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned operation.,"First transoral tumor resection: Firstly, bridle suture of the tongue. Followed by Mc Ivor spatula or retractor insertion. Tumor is resected on all sides with a safety margin of 1 to 1.5 cm. Later, the anterior palatal arch, the tonsil and parts of the pharyngeal wall and the base of the tongue up to the middle of the tongue are also resected. During resection, the deep external tongue muscles are also resected; the lingual nerve cannot be preserved and must be resected as well. The resection extends deep down to the submandibular gland. The entire preparation is marked with sutures. In addition, frozen sections are taken basally. Parts of the pharyngeal wall and the submandibular gland as well as external tongue muscles are sent in as basal margin samples for the frozen section. In the frozen section, basal margin samples are tumor-free, but the tumor extends at least as far as the cranial edge of the specimen. Therefore, the cranial mucosa including soft tissue is resected again. In addition, a cranial margin sample is taken from the soft tissue area. Now tumor-free in the frozen section. Thus R0 situation. Subsequent careful hemostasis in the entire wound area. Fatty tissue is already partially exposed next to the pharyngeal muscles. The submandibular gland and the facial artery are exposed caudally. The facial artery is ligated once. Muscle tissue is then sutured over the gland and the facial artery using Vicryl 3/0 sutures. Finally, irrigation and further careful hemostasis. No more bleeding on final inspection. No neck dissection on the right due to the extent of the resection on the right. The decision is made to perform the left neck dissection first. PEG placement and tracheostomy are also indicated. First modified radical neck dissection on the left (<CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME> in alternation) Skin incision in a typical manner in front of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then dissection of the lymph node fat packet from the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the digastric and omohyoid muscles. Exposure of the accessor nerve, internal jugular vein, internal and external carotid artery, vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Development of the dorsal neck preparation and preservation of the branches of the cervical plexus. Some conspicuous lymph nodes. Then develop the anterior neck preparation, exposing and preserving the hypoglossal nerve and superior thyroid artery. Then irrigation of the wound area with H2O2 and Ringer's solution and careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers and insertion of a Redon drain. Subsequent PEG insertion: advancement of the esophagoscope into the stomach. Insertion of a 9-bore abdominal wall tube in a typical manner without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in a typical manner. Then tracheostoma creation: Small Kocher collar incision. Dissection through subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature. This is split medially. Subsequently expose the thyroid isthmus, pass under it, clamp it, cut it open and treat it with stitches. Now expose the trachea. Entering the 2nd intercartilaginous space. Creation of a small Björk flap. Epithelialization of the same. Re-intubation and insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. Finally, enoral inspection again. No bleeding. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Overall extensive resection transorally for cT2 to cT3 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Due to the depth, neck dissection is certainly not indicated for another 2 to 3 weeks. If there is an R1 situation somewhere towards the basal area, a resection with flap coverage would be indicated. If neck dissection remains the case, removal of the submandibular gland should not be performed in any case, as otherwise there is a risk of a continuous defect.","Transoral resection on the right, Modified radical left neck dissection, PEG, Tracheotomy

Subsequent laser resection: First insert the small bore tube again and assess the findings. The carcinomulcus can be seen in the area of the left vallecula with transition to the lingual epiglottis up to the cartilage and slightly towards the arytenoid fold. Subsequent insertion of the spreading laryngoscope. Tumor is successively resected. Due to the involvement of the epiglottis up to the cartilage, an approx. 2/3 resection of the epiglottis on the left is performed, the subsequent vallecula is removed with hanging pre-epiglottic fatty tissue. Resection towards the base of the tongue far into the healthy tissue, resection at the transition from the pharyngeal wall to the base of the tongue far into the healthy tissue as well as resection of the upper parts of the aryepiglottic fold. The specimen is then thread-marked. Another marginal sample is taken at the border to the vallecula on the right side of the epiglottis extending to the base of the tongue. Both specimens are sent for frozen section. In the frozen section, the edges of the specimen and the marginal specimen are tumor-free. Thus R0 resection here. Thorough hemostasis is performed. Subsequent repositioning for neck dissection and tracheotomy: start with the tracheotomy. Creation of an epithelialized tracheostoma by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> and reintubation of the patient by the anaesthesia colleagues. Now proceed to radical neck dissection on the left side. First, a skin incision is made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the left side. Dissection from the cranial to the caudal side, directly encountering multiple large, coarse metastases in region II b to region V on the left side. Cranial exposure of the posterior venter of the digaster muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, which can be preserved. Cranial exposure of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, which could also be spared. Exposure of the internal and external carotid artery. Showing the caudal part of the omohyoid muscle, which unfortunately has to be removed. Showing the caudal aspect of the internal jugular vein. The entire lymph node package is dissected out in toto from cranial to caudal, taking the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein with it, and removed without difficulty. Removal of the internal jugular vein caudally in region V. Creation of a bypass ligature there. Creation of several bypass ligatures to avoid a postoperative chyle fistula on the left side. During the dissection, it was found that the external carotid artery was also affected by the tumor and also had to be treated by means of a bypass and removed. Dry conditions there. Multiple wound irrigation with hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Dry conditions. No evidence of a chyle fistula on the left. Placement of a 10 Redon drain. Subcutaneous suture. Skin suture. Application of a pressure bandage. Now repositioning of the patient to perform a neck dissection on the right side. Skin incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

Re-inspection of the tumor region. The tumor extends in the posterior third of the edge of the tongue, extends to the base of the tongue, the glossotonsillar groove and the alveolar ridge, but is displaceable in relation to these. Now insertion of the retractors. Place a retaining thread and pull out the tongue. Establish the resection margins with a sufficient safety margin around the tumor. Now successive dissection of the tumor, taking the right palatine tonsil with it. Careful protection of the right posterior palatal arch, the lingual nerve, the lingual fibers of the hypoglossal nerve and the Wharton's duct. Excision of the tumor with sufficient safety margin in toto. The specimen is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. Careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. In the frozen section, the tumor is found to be R0 resected, but the specimen shows a carcinoma in situ that is probably not connected to the tumor and reaches the edge of the palatal arch. Before resecting the tumor, the patient was first examined with an esophagogastroscope. Pre-viewing to the stomach and placement of the PEG tube using the thread pull-through method in the typical manner, after positive diaphanoscopy. Now turn first to neck dissection on the right. After skin disinfection, infiltration anesthesia with Ultracaine with added adrenaline. Skin incision on the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath with jugular vein, carotid artery and vagus nerve. Sparing of the structures. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and protection of the same. Now successive dissection of the lateral neck preparation while carefully protecting the plexus branches. Subsequent dissection of the remaining soft tissue below the plexus from level V. Careful hemostasis with bipolar coagulation. Several large nodes are seen in level II, these are excised in toto, the accessorius nerve can be spared here. Resection of the medial neck preparation while sparing the hypoglossal nerve. Now turn to the left neck dissection. Here too, infiltration anesthesia with Ultracaine with the addition of adrenaline after skin disinfection. Skin incision on the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure and dissection of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and protection of the same. Dissection of the cervical vascular sheath with jugular vein, carotid artery and vagus nerve. Now successive dissection of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the plexus branches. Careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Now, post-dissection in the area of the medial neck preparation and removal of the remaining soft tissue while carefully protecting the structures mentioned. Now irrigation on both sides using hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a Redon drain. Subcutaneous suture, skin suture. Now insert the mouth retractor again and turn to the primary tumor region. Post-resection in the area of the right uvular margin and the palatal arch. The specimen is sent for final histology. Removal of a marginal sample, which is again sent for frozen section diagnostics. Once again careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. In the frozen section, moderate dysplasia is still seen in the marginal sample, no evidence of carcinoma or carcinoma in situ. The operation was therefore terminated after further careful hemostasis. Conclusion: Enormal resection and neck dissection on both sides of a cT2 tongue margin carcinoma on the right. In the frozen section, in addition to the carcinoma, a carcinoma in situ in the area of the palatal arch, therefore, due to the clinical suspicion of field cancerization, adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated.

After appropriate preparation, the gastric tube is first inserted through the left nasal cavity, the correct position of which is then checked by auscultation. Skin disinfection. Infiltration with local anesthetic containing adrenaline in the area of the subsequent skin incision. Sterile washing and draping. Marking of the apron flap incision with the tracheostoma in place. Dissection of the apron flap and cranial fixation in the usual manner. Then perform the neck dissection, initially on the left side. After skeletonization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the auricularis magnus nerve is exposed and spared until the end. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the auricularis magnus nerve in the sense of neurolysis. The same is done with the accessorius nerve. Displacement and re-embedding of the accessorius nerve at the end of the operation in the sense of a neurolysis. Skeletonization of the digastric muscle with exposure and protection of the hypoglossal nerve on the left side. Displacement and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve at the end of the operation. Opening of the cervical vascular nerve sheath and skeletonization of the internal jugular vein after identification of the vagus nerve. Regions II to V are then successively resected while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. Exposure of the lateral horn of the hyoid bone. Removal of the supralaryngeal vascular nerve bundle. Separation of the left larynx caudal to the hyoid bone. Exposure of the left lobe of the thyroid gland and lateral dissection. Separation of the straight neck muscles just above the clavicle. Undercutting of the isthmus, clamping, and removal and ligation on both sides. Separation of the constrictor pharyngis muscle from the thyroid cartilage and release of the piriform sinus on the left side. Transition to the opposite side. Similar procedure here. Here, too, there is no clinical evidence of a cervical lymph node metastasis. After complete mobilization of the larynx, the tracheostoma is first created. The 2nd tracheal clasp is incised in an H-shape and the caudal mucocutaneous anastomosis is created first. The lingual side of the epiglottis is then exposed through the pre-epiglottic fat body. Then open the pharynx and develop the larynx caudally along the epiglottis and the aryepiglottic folds. The tumor appears to be purely endolaryngeal. Both incisions are then connected caudally on the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage. Dissection caudally up to the 1st tracheal clasp. The entire laryngeal preparation is then removed together with the 1st tracheal clasp. Circular marginal incisions are taken from the pharyngeal defect as well as from the specimen itself at the right sublaryngeal margin. All marginal incisions proved to be free of tumor and dysplasia. Myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle. Insertion of a Provox voice prosthesis at the upper edge of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Then suture of the pharyngeal defect with a continuous inverting Conley suture. The second suture layer is performed using single button sutures. Insertion of a Redon suction drain on both sides. Completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis of the tracheostoma. Two-layer wound closure on both sides. Sterile wound dressing. Application of a pressure dressing. Final consultation with the anesthetist.

The tumor was found to be the same size as in the previous panendoscopy. The patient is then repositioned and tumor resection begins from the soft palate. Here, the tumor does not reach the uvula so that it can be preserved. However, the anterior and posterior palatal arches must be partially removed. Careful coagulation, dissection and partial ligation of the vessels are then performed. Dissection from cranial to caudal. The main tumor mass then begins in the area of the lower tonsil pole and moves into the hypopharynx and from there onto the pharyngoepiglottic fold. The dissection is performed in the layers of the parapharyngeal musculature. Larger arterial vessels are cut several times during dissection if there is a clear tendency to bleed. Dissection is now carried out in the direction of the pharynx. In the area of the glossotonsillar groove, the tumor extends slightly onto the base of the tongue, so that a partial resection must also be carried out in the area of the base of the tongue and the tonsil at the base of the tongue. Careful hemostasis is also required here. It now appears that the tumor is draining at the level of the hypopharynx and piriform sinus entrance and can be deposited here at the pharyngoepiglottic plica. A separate margin sample is then taken in the area of the caudal margin. The corresponding area on the tumor specimen is also marked with a thread. This margin sample and the tumor specimen are then sent for frozen section assessment. However, this shows that the marginal specimen in the area of the deposit margin at the base of the tongue cannot be assessed due to thermal alterations. The sedimentation margin sample in the area of the caudal sedimentation margin shows broad tumor infiltrates, so that the decision is made to reposition the patient and use the spreading laryngoscope to adjust the area of the hypopharynx and the caudal sedimentation area. This is done easily after insertion of the mouthguard. Then pre-segmentation under vision up to the hypopharynx and adjustment of the caudal tumor bed. The surgical microscope and CO2 laser are now added so that this area can be resected again over a large area with the laser. Again, careful bipolar coagulation of larger vessel stumps. A marginal sample is then taken again. Both the resected specimen and the marginal specimen are then sent again for frozen section assessment. The findings here are that broad tumor infiltrates can again be found in the post-resectate. The marginal sample is again strongly thermally altered, but shows no tumor infiltrates. However, due to the poor findings, a second margin sample was taken, which was then designated as margin sample caudal no. 3 and was again sent for frozen section. This is then found to be tumor-free, so that an R0 resection of the tumor can now be assumed. Therefore, after repeated careful hemostasis, the PEG tube is inserted. To do this, the flexible esophagoscope is inserted into the esophagus and the tube is advanced under visualization into the stomach, where the PEG tube can then be placed without difficulty if the diaphanoscopy is positive and the tent phenomenon is positive. This is done using the typical thread pull-through method. The patient is then mirrored back and the esophagus is carefully inspected again, where the mucosa is found to be normal. The patient is then repositioned for the tracheostomy. Inject local anesthetic with adrenaline on both sides of the neck as well as prelaryngeally and tracheally. A door incision is then made pretracheally and dissected in layers in depth. Pre-tracheal vein branches are then partly ligated and partly bipolar coagulated. The pretracheal musculature is then exposed, separated in the midline and dissected apart. Further layered dissection in depth and exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is then undermined and, after separation of the isthmus, is ligated on both sides. Then expose the anterior surface of the trachea. Now enter the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp. Dissection of the Björk flap. Then circular suturing and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Then reintubation, which is also possible with an 8 mm tube. Now reposition the patient for neck dissection on the right side. First make a skin incision along the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then dissect in layers in depth after cutting through the platysma. Expose the cervical vascular sheath. In the cranial area, exposure and neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the auricularis magnus nerve. Then further dissection of the cervical vascular sheath in layers as far caudally as the omohyoid muscle and cranially to the digaster muscle. Here, lateral exposure of the accessorius nerve. Here too, neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the nerve. Then complete release of the lateral neck preparation from the accessorius triangle caudally, in the sense of levels II and III as well as IV and V. There is a lymph node conglomerate in the area of the vein angle, but this can be easily dissected away from the vein so that it can be well preserved. During dissection of the cervical vascular sheath, neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the vagus nerve. Subsequently, in the area of the hypoglossal triangle during preparation of the level Ib neck specimen. Then protection of all branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery. Here also neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve. The cervical profunda is also completely preserved during dissection and is also relocated and re-embedded in its course after neurolysis. Now dissection of the caudal medial neck preparation, where no conspicuous lymph nodes are found. All branches of the cervical plexus were also preserved during dissection of the lateral neck specimen. After significant arterial bleeding occurred intraoperatively in the area of the tumor resection, the decision was made to cut off the external carotid artery above the exit of the superior thyroid artery, which was then carried out without any problems after the external carotid artery had been clearly identified. The wound is then carefully irrigated. In summary, this results in a level Ib-V neck dissection. A Redon drain is then inserted. Two-layer wound closure and dressing. The patient is then repositioned for neck dissection on the left side. Here too, skin incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the left side. Subsequent dissection in layers in depth. In the cranial area, neurolysis, exposure and protection of the auricularis magnus nerve, after displacement of the nerve cranially. Further layered preparation in depth after cutting through the platysma. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the caudal and cranial borders. Exposure, neurolysis and displacement as well as re-embedding of the accessorius nerve. Then, here too, release of the lateral neck preparation from the accessorius triangle caudally. Dissection of the venous angle and hypoglossal triangle. In doing so, protect all branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery. Also exposure, neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve with the cervical profunda. Then complete dissection of the anterior neck preparation. Here too, the branches and branches of the external carotid artery and internal jugular vein are preserved. During dissection, the vagus nerve is also exposed, neurolyzed, displaced and re-embedded. Here, too, careful hemostasis was performed. Overall, this also results in a level Ib-V neck dissection. A Redon drain is then inserted and the wound is closed in two layers. Once the dressing has been applied, the procedure is completed after another enoral bleeding check with dry wound conditions. The patient is ventilated via the tracheostoma and transferred to the in-house intensive care unit. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist.","Transoral tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection

Sonographically, there is a yN2c neck status.","Introductory consultation with the anesthetist. Positioning of the patient and injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline in the area of the scar of the apron flap. Then skin incision along the old neck scar and preparation of an apron flap. Then exposure of the front edges of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides. Start with the neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Long dissection of the cervical vascular sheath with the internal jugular vein and the carotid artery and its branches as well as the vagus nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Exposure of the cervical plexus. A small lymph node conglomerate lateral to the vein can be seen caudal to the cervical plexus. This is excised. Careful hemostasis is performed. Dissection on the deep cervical fascia cranially up to the accessorius triangle. The hypoglossal triangle and the anterior neck preparation are also excised. Overall, there is massive scarring here, which is why the preparation conditions are significantly more difficult. Transition to the left side. Slightly less scarring here and therefore easier preparation. However, after exposing the cervical vascular sheath, the lateral neck preparation is still relatively complete. Therefore, exposure of the accessorius nerve, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the accessorius nerve and removal of the lateral neck preparation. Subsequently, the hypoglossal triangle and the anterior neck preparation were exposed and evacuated while sparing all branches of the external carotid artery and the internal jugular vein. On the right side, the facial vein was ligated. This results in neck revisions of levels Ib, II, III, IV and V on both sides. This is released cranially. This is followed by caudal release of the infrahyoid muscles. Separation of the prelaryngeal musculature in the median line so that the infrahyoid musculature and infralaryngeal musculature can be dissected away to the side. This exposes the laryngeal framework. The tumor does not appear to have penetrated the larynx on the right side, the cartilaginous border is intact here. Dissection up to the exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Dissection of the anterior wall of the trachea. Separation of the scarred parts of the thyroid gland. Hardened or suspicious nodules are not palpable in the thyroid gland if multinodular goiter is known. Visualization of the old scar of the former tracheotomy. Enter the trachea and prepare a visor tracheotomy. Subsequent intubation via an endotracheal tube via the tracheostoma and removal of the nasal tube placed by the anesthesia colleagues. Insertion of a McIvor blade into the vallecula and opening of the pharynx. Widen the pharyngeal opening so that the restepiglottis is visible. The supraglottic tumor described on the right side can now be seen in the view. Partial resection of the restepiglottis and caudal dissection. The dissection is performed above the level of the ligament. Lateral incision on the right side. Here it can be seen that the tumor has grown subepithelially paraglottically to far caudally, well below the vocal cord level. There is extensive tumor infestation here, which no longer allows partial laryngeal resection, so a switch is made to total laryngectomy. This completely exposes the lateral edges of the thyroid cartilage and dissects the pharyngeal wall. Complete the incision via the aryepiglottic fold of the right side into the postcricoid region so that the pharynx can be separated from the larynx here by cutting around the aryepiglottic fold of the right side, which is completely consumed by the tumor. Further dissection caudally at the posterior edge of the larynx up to the cricoid cartilage plate. The larynx is then deposited below the cricoid cartilage. Examination of the specimen. The tumor is resected in sano. Despite this, marginal samples are taken from the base of the tongue. It appears that the tumor may have invaded this area. The tissue appears conspicuously hardened and somewhat restless, so that a small portion of the base of the tongue is resected first. A marginal sample is then taken for a frozen section assessment. Also take marginal samples from both pharyngeal side walls and the postcricoid region. All marginal samples are assessed as tumor-free. Insertion of the Provox prosthesis in the form of a Provox 2 size 6 at the typical location. Subsequent closure of the pharynx after myotomy on both sides. The pharynx is closed with single button sutures and then in a second layer using continuous sutures. TachoSil is glued to the ends on both sides and to the intersection of the horizontal and vertical pharyngeal suture. Suture the infrahyoid muscles in front of the pharynx again. Then release the medial parts of the insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to prevent the tracheostoma from sinking in deeply for later treatment. Repeated careful hemostasis. Insertion of large Redon drains into the neck on both sides. Two-layer wound closure of the apron flap and circular suturing of the tracheostoma. Application of a pressure bandage on both sides. A nasogastric tube was placed in the patient at the beginning of the operation. This is now reattached and remains in place. The patient received intravenous antibiotics preoperatively and at the end of the operation, which were to be continued for 3 days postoperatively. Final consultation with the anesthesia department. The patient is kept awake in the in-house intensive care unit for monitoring.","Laryngectomy, Neck dissection

The PEG is inserted in the usual manner using the pull-through technique. The skin is then disinfected and infiltrated with local anesthetic containing adrenaline in the area of the right neck or the right half of the subsequent apron flap incision. Here, sharp dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue and the platysma with exposure of the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is exposed along its entire length. Then expose and skeletonize the digastric muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Now dissect the vascular nerve sheath starting caudally. Expose and protect the vagus nerve and the common carotid artery as well as the internal jugular vein up to ............................................... The large metastasis is then painstakingly dissected along the internal jugular vein to below the digastric muscle. Both the accessorius nerve and the hypoglossal nerve can be exposed and secured to the end. The metastasis can finally be dissected free from the vein and the entire resectate together with the neck dissection specimen of region II to V can be removed in toto. The last layers of tissue on the vein as well as a vein outlet supposedly located in the metastasis are examined using frozen section histology and reveal no tumor infiltration, so that a healthy dissection can be assumed. Therefore, the apron flap is widened on the left side and folded up to above the hyoid bone. This is followed by radical neck dissection on the left side. Here, the vascular nerve sheath is first exposed under the digastric muscle and distally at the level of the omohyoid muscle. The metastasis here encompasses the internal jugular vein and can thus just be separated from the common carotid artery and the bifurcation as well as from the internal carotid artery in a healthy layer. However, the hypoglossal nerve and the accessorius nerve cannot be preserved. The internal jugular vein is then removed caudally and cranially and the entire specimen, including the neck dissection section, is completely resected. The larynx is then released. The suprahyoid muscles are first removed up to the pre-epiglottic fat body on both sides. First release of the laryngeal skeleton on the left side. Dissection of the right thyroid lobe and ligation of the isthmus so that the right thyroid lobe can be folded laterally. Subsequently, separation of the muscular insertions of the constrictor pharyngis muscle from the thyroid cartilage. Release the piriform sinus. Same procedure on the opposite side. The upper trachea is then exposed on the first 5 tracheal clamps. Opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasps and reintubation of the patient. The lingual epiglottis is then exposed submucosally up to its superior edge. There, the pharyngeal mucosa is incised and the epiglottis is turned ventrally. After releasing the epiglottis, one looks at the rather large tumor located on the left side in the area of the arytenoid region. This is first incised on the left side. The same is done on the right side. The larynx is then removed under the cricoid cartilage and dissected cranially. The tumor and the laryngectomy specimen are then removed in toto under visualization and the two pharyngeal incisions are joined together in the area of the esophageal entrance. During the subsequent inspection, the resectate appears to be somewhat closer to the right hypopharynx. Therefore, another resection is performed here, which is not sent for frozen section histology. Subsequently, marginal sections are taken from all sides of the remaining pharynx, all of which are found to be tumor-free by frozen section histology. Particularly in the caudal part of the pharynx with the transition to the esophagus, there is just enough mucosa left to allow primary closure to be performed. Subsequent myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle. Implantation of the Provox voice prosthesis in the usual manner. Then resection of the 2 upper tracheal clips so that the trachea can then be drained directly. The pharyngeal suture is then applied. The first layer forms a continuous T-shaped Conley suture. The second layer above this is performed in a single button suture. Finally, Redon suction drains are placed on both sides. Folding back of the apron flap and multi-layer wound closure with completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis in the area of the tracheostoma and reintubation of the patient onto a 10-gauge tracheostomy tube. End of the operation after sterile wound dressing and handover of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Totae laryngectomy for a squamous cell carcinoma located mainly on the left side of the arytenoid region with primary wound closure. Radical neck dissection on the left side and selective neck dissection on the right. Primary voice rehabilitation by implantation of a Provox voice prosthesis and myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle. PEG placement. Due to the pronounced metastasis, adjuvant therapy in the form of radiochemotherapy is certainly recommended.","Total laryngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, PEG placement, Provox placement

CT showed deep infiltration of the ................... so that primary transcervical resection and flap coverage had to be planned. Radial flap not possible in the planning, therefore defect coverage planned as ALT.","First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The exophytic tumor is seen in the tonsillar lobe area extending from the palatine arch down to the hypoharyngeal entrance, involving the base of the tongue, on the edge of the tongue on the left side, tumor extends medially over the vallecula and lingual epiglottis to just above the midline, here in the supraglottic area. Base of tongue palpatorily affected up to the midline. Indication for surgery with flap coverage confirmed. Now repositioning of the patient. Injection not possible due to the cardiologic situation. Start with extended radical neck dissection on the left: Typical skin incision in front of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This shows that the lymph node package has infiltrated the muscle in the middle and cranial area. The muscle is therefore removed cranially and caudally and also resected. Further dissection shows infiltration of the internal jugular vein, which is separated slightly below the exit of the inferior thyroid and ligated twice. However, the external jugular vein was preserved during dissection, and a supraclavicular vein and an additional outlet from the internal jugular vein, which could be used as a vascular anastomosis, can also be seen in the lower area. Further dissection shows infiltration of the lymph node conglomerate in the submandibular gland, hence resection of this gland and the caudal parotid pole as well as the digastric musculature. There is also infiltration of the external carotid artery. This must be placed just above the bulb and is supplied here by means of bypasses. The facial artery, lingual artery, superior thyroid artery and all other cranial ascending branches up to the superficial temporal artery must be resected and ligated. The external carotid artery is ligated twice cranially. It becomes apparent that the tumor is in contact with the primary tumor, so that per continuitatem growth at the level of the hyoid bone and in the area of the resected external carotid artery must be suspected. This is followed by repositioning for first transoral and then transcervical combined resection of the oropharyngeal carcinoma. First insertion of the tonsillar blocker from the transoral side, alternating with oral blockers. Tongue ligation. Tumor is incised on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm to 2 cm. This involves resection of the palatal arch from the uvula to the left, all tissue up to the lower jaw, whereby the periosteum is pushed away from the lower jaw. Pterygoid muscles are resected per continuitatem through the wall. The internal carotid artery is checked from the side here. The posterior wall of the oropharynx is resected almost to the middle. The posterior half of the tongue is initially resected superficially and only later in the tongue base area beyond the midline. The mobilized specimen is finally pulled through transcervically and the mucosa is resected under visualization up to the piriform sinus entrance in the oropharyngeal side wall area. The entire vallecula, the epiglottis and the base of the tongue are resected medially until a residual portion of approx. 25 % remains. This is still well supplied with blood. On the opposite side, the more cranial base of the tongue is still preserved and the caudal part is resected together with the vallecula. Resection ends at the beginning of the supraglottic area after removal of the epiglottis. The entire preparation and a marginal sample from the palatal arch and from the area of the base of the tongue and vallecula on the right side are sent in. Here the specimen on all sides in healthy tissue, including basal, cranial and caudal as well as the marginal specimens are also tumor-free. The intraoperative situation is therefore R0. Neck dissection now follows on the right side. Skin incision in the typical manner, dissection of the fat lymph node package of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The lymph node is adherent to the facial vein and internal jugular vein, but can be dissected here while preserving the vessels. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Final exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossus. Development of the dorsal neck preparation while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Subsequent development of the anterior neck preparation. The result is a neck dissection level II to V on the right side and Ib to V on the left side. Now the tracheostoma is created in the typical manner. Longitudinal section between the neck sections. Depiction of the trachea. Entering the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Small, broadly pedunculated Björk flap. This is epithelized in a typical manner. Re-intubation and insertion of laryngectomy tube. The defect is then covered using a pectoralis major flap: The planned defect coverage using a free flap proves to be unfeasible intraoperatively. The remaining residual stump of the left external carotid artery shows clear calcific plaques on palpation. If the patient has had an apoplexy, clamping without an increased risk of reapoplexy does not make sense here. Venous anastomosis on the left via the external jugular vein is possible. However, the arterial connection on the same side is missing. The evaluation of the vessels in the supraclavicular region also shows no corresponding possibilities for a vascular connection. ........................ The right side shows an external carotid artery, which is too short for a primary anastomosis of the ALT and also too small for a possible interposition. The first outlet appears to be a thyro-lingual artery. The transection of the lingual artery is not possible due to the previous resection of the opposite side. This also rules out the external carotid artery as an option for arterial anastomosis. The only remaining option is to use a pectoralis major flap to cover the defect. The patient is therefore repositioned. Sterile covering of the entire thoracic area up to the upper abdomen. After measuring the length of the flap pedicle and the size of the skin island, the island is marked according to the extent and shape of the defect. A subfascial skin bridge is then created from the neck area to the lower end of the marked deltopectoral flap, which is not lifted distally. Then expose the pectoralis major muscle and expose the vascular pedicle. The flap is then cut to the appropriate size and length and securing sutures are placed. The flap has a length of 11 1/2 cm and a width of 6 cm in the distal area and 9 cm in the proximal area. Successive development of the flap on its muscle pedicle including the vascular nerve bundle up to the clavicle. The flap is then pulled under the skin bridge. Insertion of the flap into the oropharyngeal defect. The flap is first sutured cranially, including the palatal arch. Caudally, the flap extends to the piriform sinus entrance, it then swivels towards the supraglottic area. The skin island is sutured directly supraglottically to the thyroid cartilage. Complete low-tension closure of the defect. Subsequent layer-by-layer closure of the thoracic wound after skin mobilization, which is successful without tension. Skin closure after extensive hemostasis with insertion of 2 Redon drains. On the left cervical side, tension-free closure over the pedicle after radical neck dissection with insertion of 2 Redon drains. On the right, the wound is closed with the insertion of a Redon drain. An 8-gauge tracheostomy tube is inserted into the tracheostoma. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit postoperatively and ventilated. Antibiotic treatment, which was started intraoperatively, is continued with Unacid for one week. In the case of circulatory instability or previous cardiological illness and due to the use of Plavix or previous heparinization, the operation was characterized by a diffuse bleeding tendency in the advanced course. Factor replacement and preservatives were necessary. Post-operative nutrition via the inserted PEG for 10 days, followed by gruel and then, if necessary, diet reconstruction. Overall cT4a cN2c findings and continuous growth on the left. Postoperative RCT recommended if the patient's condition permits.","Resection and flap coverage, Pedicled flap (Pectoralis major)

Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.,"First induction of anesthesia and intubation with a laser tube transorally via the anesthesia colleagues. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and identification of the tumor. This is very difficult as the tumor has been reduced in size by the biopsy and only a scarred area is visible. A sample is therefore taken from this area to ensure that the tumor is resected correctly. The frozen section of this sample shows at least a carinoma in situ and suspected invasive carcinoma matching the preliminary histology and after consultation with the pathology department it is the site described. Therefore, insertion of the DaVinci oral retractor. Insertion of camera and dissection arm and dissector arm. The tumor is now robotically sectioned using monopolar coagulation and the specimen is thread-marked for the frozen section. In the frozen section, there is still invasive tumor in the basal/caudal margin. For this reason, a large resection is made here, thread-marked and also sent to the frozen section. Neither carcinoma in situ nor invasive carcinoma can now be detected at the basal and mucosal margins remote from the tumor, i.e. a definitive R0 situation. Moderate bleeding occurs during the post-resection, which is monopolar coagulated and thus stopped. Due to the relatively large wound area at the base of the tongue, a protective tracheotomy must be performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Skin incision below the cricoid cartilage for this. Dissection down to the trachea. Cut through the thyroid isthmus and enter the trachea between the second and third tracheal cartilage. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Re-intubation to an 8 mm tracheal cannula and completion of the procedure without complications.

Entering with 0° optics and inspection of the tumor. The tumor is located on the left side, completely infiltrating the vocal folds. Pass the tumor region and look subglottically. Here, there is a slight extension in the subglottic slope. The subglottis itself and the trachea are tumor-free. Intubation by the anesthesia colleagues transnasally. Entry with the small bore tube and re-inspection of the tumor region. It is clear that the tumor extends very far caudally in the area of the arytenoid cartilage. A visible mucosal infiltration extends as far as the arytenoid cartilage. The arytenoid cartilage itself is distended and thickened, suggesting a submucosal infiltration. Decision to perform a laryngectomy due to the age and extent of the tumor. Esophageal entrance and piriform sinus on both sides are free. Sterile washing and covering after injection. Creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Start with neck dissection on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the neck levels IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. There are several spherical and suspicious masses on all sides, especially in levels II and III. Exposure of the hyoid bone. Detachment of the hyoid bone on the left side. Detachment of the cervical vascular sheath from the larynx and pharyngeal region. Detachment of the thyroid gland. Exposure of the upper laryngeal bundle. Coagulation of the upper laryngeal bundle and transection of the upper laryngeal bundle. Turning to the opposite side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, submandibular gland, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Clearing out the neck levels IIa to Va. There are several suspicious lymph nodes, especially in levels IIa and b. Exposure of the hyoid bone here as well. Release of the hyoid bone. Removal of the hyoid bone. Exposure of the superior laryngeal nerve, A. and V. laryngea. Separation of these. Detachment of the cervical vascular sheath from the larynx and pharyngeal region and detachment of the thyroid gland. Detachment of the infrahyal musculature and the laryngeal musculature. Performing the tracheotomy between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Transfer intubation to a laryngectomy tube. Start skeletonization of the larynx on the right side. Release and push off the piriform sinus, same procedure on the left side. Here the piriform sinus can only be partially released, as this is the tumor side. Enter the pharynx at the level of the epiglottis from the right side. Pull out the epiglottis through the pharyngotomy and incise the mucosa along the edge of the epiglottis up to the arytenoid region. Here, detachment of the mucosa caudally from the arytenoid cartilage. Detachment and separation of the larynx. In the area of the piriform sinus on the left side, the mucosa and soft tissue are resected again and a marginal sample is taken. Unfortunately, this marginal sample still shows carcinoma. Therefore, a large resection and another marginal sample are taken. This marginal sample is ultimately tumor-free. Creation of an esophagotracheal fistula and insertion of a size 10 Provox prosthesis (Provox 1). Perform the pharyngeal suture in a three-layered manner as usual. Reduction of the insertions of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and insertion of Redon drains. Incision of the skin in the area of the tracheostoma and two-layer wound closure. The operation is completed without complications. The patient goes to the intensive care unit in an awake state. Please continue antibiotics for 24 hours.

Indication for the above-mentioned operation.,"First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: insertion of the Kleinsasser tube of medium size. The clearly exophytic tumor can be seen, which has consumed about 75% of the epiglottis, the tumor runs over the arytenoid fold onto the medial anterior and lateral wall in the area of the piriform sinus or pharyngeal side wall. Tumor does not appear to be optimally displaceable, particularly in the area of the vallecula, where infiltration is also evident; deeper growth is likely in the case of ulceration. The base of the tongue is not affected. In conjunction with the CT, where an infiltration of the pre-epiglottic space up to the hyoid bone is described and the proximity of the tumor to vessels, lymph node metastases. Decision to proceed primarily from the outside after discussing the findings with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. PEG insertion (<CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME>): Insertion of the esophagoscope in a typical manner. Advance into the stomach, where a 9-bore abdominal wall tube is inserted in the typical manner after a diaphanoscopy has been performed. Fixation of this. Then sterile draping, injection of a total of 12 ml xylocaine 1% with arenalin in the area of the neck on both sides. Then marking of a platysmal flap for possible defect coverage in case of pharyngeal wall infestation. Then elevation of an apron flap subplatysmal including the platysmal flap to be elevated. The platysmal flap is dissected in its skin island and lifted from the neck skin, including the subcutaneous tissue. However, dissection is not carried out up to the chin; this should only be done during the final flap suture. Dissection of the apron flap up to the level of the hyoid bone and submandibular gland on both sides. This is followed by radical neck dissection on the right: a large lymph node package is seen on the right. This is difficult to separate from the sternocleidomastoid muscle, so that the muscle is partially resected here. However, an actual infiltration is not recognizable. Depiction of the digastric muscle, omohyoid muscle. Depiction of the internal jugular vein. This appears clearly infiltrated after dissection of some lymph nodes in the middle area. Exposure of the vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and internal and external carotid artery. Depiction of the hypoglossal nerve. This can be dissected away from the lymph node conglomerate with some effort. Infiltrated internal jugular vein is resected in the middle area and double ligated cranially and caudally. Then develop the entire lymph node conglomerate together with the dorsal neck preparation, whereby some branches of the cervical plexus are also embedded in the conglomerate and must therefore also be resected. However, the most important branches including the phrenic nerve can be preserved. Subsequently, development of the anterior neck preparation with ligation of the superior thyroid artery. Then modified radical neck dissection on the left: Exposure of the omohyoid and digastric muscles as on the opposite side. Inclusion of the submandibular gland capsule as on the opposite side. Dorsal neck preparation is developed with exposure of the internal jugular vein, carotid artery, vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Removal is performed while preserving all cervical plexus structures. Subsequent development of the anterior neck preparation as on the opposite side. The superior thyroid artery is preserved. The hypoglossal nerve is also exposed and preserved. Then tumor resection: separation of the suprahyoid muscles from the right to the paramedian left. Exposure of hyoid bone. Exposure of ..................... superior. Detachment of the constrictor pharyngis muscle. All soft tissue behind the hyoid bone up to the larynx is also resected. Entry into the left paramedian larynx. Exposure of the epiglottis. After cutting around the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1-1.5 cm on all sides. Part of the left pharyngeal wall up to the middle of the lateral wall and the entire supraglottic area including both aryepiglottic folds are removed, leaving the thyroid cartilage intact. Vallecula and caudalmost parts of the base of the tongue are also resected. Tumor clearly removed in healthy tissue. Tumor is thread-marked. Marginal samples are taken from the arytenoid region as well as a resection in the tongue base region and a marginal sample in the tongue base region. The marginal samples and the marked tumor specimen are sent for frozen section diagnosis. Tumor in healthy tissue removed at the preoparate, marginal samples also tumor-free. Thus R0 resection. This is followed by complete irrigation of the entire wound area with H202 and Ringer's solution and careful hemostasis. The lingual artery is prophylactically ligated on the right side and severed. The lingual artery and superior thyroid artery on the tumor side are ligated and severed. The superior laryngeal nerve is preserved on both sides. Reconstruction as after Alonso resection. The posterior dorsal pharyngeal wall areas are adapted on the left and especially on the right using 3.0 single-button Vircyl sutures so that the defect remains towards the thyroid cartilage. The piriform sinus entrance is preserved. The arytenoid cartilage is exposed on the right side. Soft tissue largely removed up to the thyroid cartilage towards the front. The thyroid cartilage is then sutured with several Vicryl 0 sutures so that the thyroid cartilage comes to lie under the hyoid bone. This ensures stable and complete closure of the defect. The infrahyoid musculature is then sutured back to the hyoid bone. Before the tumor resection, a tracheostoma was also created. Here, the thyroid isthmus was exposed in a typical manner, passed underneath, clamped and supplied by means of stab ligatures. A Björk flap similar to a virsier flap was then created and epithelized in the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. This was followed by reintubation and insertion of a laryngectomy tube. The wound area was then irrigated again with H202 and Ringer's solution and careful hemostasis was performed. The wound was then closed in layers with epithelialization of the tracheostoma and re-suturing of the skin island of the platysmal flap. A Redon drain was inserted on both sides. Finally, reintubation and insertion of a 7-gauge tracheostomy tube. The patient received Unacid 3 g i.v. intraoperatively. Please continue this antibiotic treatment for one week. Please feed patient via PEG for 7-10 days. Afterwards, if necessary, gruel swallowing and diet build-up. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring.","Partial laryngeal resection according to Alonso, Right pharyngeal partial resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheostomy, PEG placement, Endoscopy

When the tumor growth was insufficiently reduced both clinically and on PET-CT, a laryngectomy was indicated.","Introductory consultation with the anesthetist. First placement of the nasogastric feeding tube. Then injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline and preparation of an apron flap. Dissection of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides. First expose the cervical vascular sheath on the right side. The venous vessels in particular are extremely fragile. There is therefore a greatly increased tendency to bleed and the surgical conditions are very difficult. First dissection of the lateral neck preparation. Tearing of the internal jugular vein, which must be sutured over. The vessel can thus be preserved in its continuity. Dissection of the accessorius nerve. Displacement to the cranial side and re-embedding of the nerve at the end of the operation in the sense of neurolysis. The same procedure is used for the vagus nerve, but it is moved medially. Re-embedding of the nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Same procedure for the hypoglossal nerve. Displacement to the cranial side and at the end of the operation re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Finally, dissection of the entire neck preparation of levels Ib, II, III, IV and V. Subsequent separation of the upper pole of the thyroid gland from the trachea and the laryngeal skeleton. Exposure of the hyoid bone. Transition to neck dissection on the left side. This shows a lymph node conglomerate in the area of the venous angle. Caudal exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Here, too, the situation is the same as on the other side of the neck. With very fragile vessels, there is a significantly increased tendency to bleed here. The preparation conditions are also very difficult here. First attempt at long-distance dissection of the cervical vascular sheath. However, it then becomes apparent that the conglomerate is firmly attached to the venous angle and cannot be separated. Therefore, first expose the internal jugular vein cranially and caudally. This is first looped here. Dissect caudally and separate the vein. Stitch around the distal vein stump. Dissection on the common carotid artery. Dissection is performed cranially up to the carotid bifurcation. The conglomerate can also be seen here to be firmly fused to the external carotid artery. The adventitia is partially resected from the artery in order to separate the conglomerate in sano from the external carotid artery. The specimen can be easily separated on the internal carotid artery. The vagus nerve is also dissected over a long distance. This can also be separated from the lymph node conglomerate with difficulty, but nevertheless in sano. The nerve remains completely intact in its continuity. Same procedure for the hypoglossal nerve. Displacement and re-embedding of the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. The course of the accessory nerve must also be dissected sharply from the preparation in part, but its continuity is also preserved. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Finally, the entire conglomerate can be removed from the carotid artery and the jugular vein can be traced further upwards. Proximal removal of the internal jugular vein. Stitch around the proximal venous stump. The same is done with the facial vein. Finally, the entire conglomerate can be removed together with the lateral neck preparation. Touch up in the area of the accessorius triangle. Finally, this also results in a neck dissection of levels Ib to V. Here too, separation of the thyroid gland from the laryngeal skeleton. Dissection of the anterior surface of the trachea after cutting through the thyroid isthmus. Opening of the trachea between the 1st and 2nd cartilage clasp and extubation of the patient and insertion of a laryngectomy tube into the distal trachea. Further exposure of the hyoid bone. Finally, opening of the pharynx caudal to the hyoid bone. Successive detachment of the epiglottis and recutting of the epiglottis on the right side over the arytenoid cusps. Partial resection of the pharynx on the left side, where a scarred change is visible in the former tumor area. This entire area is also resected. Finally, the incision is brought together below the arytenoid hump. Further separation of the laryngeal skeleton from the pharynx. The pharynx was first removed from the thyroid cartilage margins. The preparation is then made up to caudal to the cricoid cartilage so that the preparation can be removed in toto. Removal of a marginal sample from the lateral edge of the pharynx on the left side, which is assessed as tumor-free in the frozen section. This shows an R0 resection after all other margins were far away from the tumor. Subtle hemostasis. Closure of the pharynx in three layers. Reconstruction of the infrahyoid musculature, which is also closed before the pharynx. Before closing the pharynx, first perform a paramedian myotomy on the left side. Also insertion of a voice valve prosthesis. This is done retrogradely without any problems. The Provox prosthesis is positioned at a typical location on the upper edge of the tracheostoma to be reconstructed later. Shortening of the medial parts of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the base of the clavicle. Repeated subtle hemostasis. Insertion of a Redon drain into the neck on both sides. Fold back the apron flap, which is sutured in two layers. Application of a pressure bandage. Intubation of the patient onto a size 10 tracheostomy tube. Final consultation with the anaesthetist. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is transferred to the in-house intensive care unit for monitoring.","Laryngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Nasogastric feeding tube

Injection of 5 ml Ultracaine with added Suprarenin along the skin incision. Sterile abjoration. Marking of the skin incision. It runs in a line 5 cm long between the cricoid and a point 2 transverse fingers above the jugulum along the median line on the neck. Now sharply cut through the skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma with the 15 mm scalpel. The anterior jugular vein is exposed and is ligated and cut. Further dissection in depth. The linea alba and the infrahyoid musculature are found. Here dissection after bipolar coagulation. The thyroid gland is now revealed. With the Overholt clamp, the thyroid isthmus is undercut and bipolarly coagulated. A visor tracheotomy is performed between the 3rd and 4th tracheal ring and mucocutaneous anastomosis with Ethibond sutures in the typical manner. Then insertion with the flexible gastroesophagoscope and placement of the PEG through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Entry with the gastroesophagoscope and air insufflation into the stomach. Once in the stomach, endoscopy of the cardia after inversion of the endoscope. A spontaneous diaphanoscopy can now be seen. A PEG is now placed in loco typico on the anterior wall of the stomach using the suture pull-through method. This was performed without any problems. The patient received Unacid 3 g i.v. perioperatively. Then sterile washing and draping and positioning of the patient and start of inspection of the tumor region by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The tumor extends from the right tonsil to the right palatal arch, passes to the uvula and also extends to the left palatal arch, covering the anterior and posterior palatal arch and the entire soft palate. On the right side, the entire tonsil is tumorously altered and also the pharyngeal side wall up to the vallecula. The base of the tongue is only marginally affected. Now start with transoral tumor resection in the area of the soft palate, the uvula and the soft palate. Then further dissection along the pharyngeal side wall and in the area of the medial parts of the pharynx. Then perform the neck dissection on the right side. To do this, expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the submandibular gland, the omohyoid and digastric muscles, the accessorius and hypoglossal nerves and the cervical vascular sheath. Then removal of the metastases and the neck preparation from level II a to V a. Unfortunately, parts of the cervical plexus and the hypoglossal nerve must also be resected here. Then continue the tumor resection from transcervical. To do this, the submandibular gland must be removed and the digastric muscle severed. Then disluxate the tumor and remove the remaining tumor tissue. In the area of the medial pharyngeal border, the tumor resection appears relatively close. A generous resection and a marginal specimen are performed here. Ultimately, all margin samples in the frozen section are R0. Parallel to the tumor resection, the radialis graft is lifted. Due to the resection, the radialis graft is relatively narrow in the caudal section. The pharynx must be gathered here. Carry out the neck dissection on the left side through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>.Enter with the 15 mm scalpel and make a skin incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle from the mastoid to the caudal, in a curved line along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sharp transection of the skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma. The external jugular vein is exposed, ligated and cut. The platysma flap is now dissected using a scalpel. Dissection along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in depth. The accessorius nerve is now exposed and protected. The accessory nerve is followed in a cranial direction and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle can now be seen. Further medially, the submandibular gland can be seen, which is also easily visualized. The omohyoid muscle is visible caudally. The cervical vascular sheath is visible in the depth below several neck metastases. The internal jugular vein is exposed from caudal to cranial. There is no injury to the structures here. The superior thyroid vein and facial vein are dissected and spared. Medial to the jugular vein, the common carotid artery and the external carotid artery are exposed as well as the vagus nerve and the cervical artery. The neck preparation is now detached in level II b, followed by level II a while sparing the accessorius nerve, and levels III/IV and V are also detached without difficulty. The plexus branches are visualized and specifically spared. No chyle fistula occurs caudally when the neck preparation is removed. The anterior neck preparation is now also exposed and dissected along the facial vein and the superior thyroid vein. Clinically clear evidence of multiple cervical lymph node metastases on the left side. Thus cN2c neck status. The hypoglossal nerve is shown cranially; the nerve is also clearly spared on this side. Elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (13 x 7 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Defect coverage of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. The graft is sutured in place by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who also performs the anastomosis in the area of the neck vessels. After removal of the radial artery flap, it is flushed with heparin solution. Insertion of the flap into the defect. It becomes apparent that the defect size slightly exceeds the flap size due to the post-resection. However, the flap can be sutured successively into the defect without tension, sometimes with the sutures in place. Sutures with single button sutures 3-0 Vicryl. The entire defect is successfully covered, except for a small portion in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Here the flap is sutured to the prevertebral fascia. Otherwise, the base of the tongue, pharyngeal side wall and palatal arch area are covered. A gastric tube is inserted to ensure the nasopharyngeal passage. The stalk passed through the right side of the neck is then anastomosed. The superior thyroid artery is selected for the anastomosis. After conditioning, this is sutured to the radial artery or anastomosed with 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. Subsequent conditioning of the cephalic vein. This is relatively poorly patency distally, but after cutting it back there is good venous return further proximally. The accompanying vein of the radial artery is selected as the 2nd connecting vein, which is, however, very thin. After conditioning the vessels with a 2.5 mm coupler, the cephalic vein is anastomosed with a venous outlet from the middle thyroid vein.

Then, the Kleinsasser C-tube is inserted and the tumor, which occupies the base of the tongue on the right side, is inspected. The previously described, approx. 1.5 x 1.5 cm exophytic mass can be palpated again. Inspection of the rest of the hypopharynx and larynx, which is unremarkable. Now laser laryngoscope and start with laser excision with 5 watts, generous incisions are made. Monopolar coagulation in between. Removal of the tumor without problems and major bleeding. The tumor is marked on a piece of cardboard. The edges are scored differently as follows. 2 notches correspond to the upper end, 3 notches to the medial end, 4 notches to the lateral end and 1 notch to the lower edge. As the tumor extends to the lower right tonsil pole, a right tonsillectomy is now performed. Insertion of the tonsil plug and dislocation of the tonsil at the upper pole. Mucosal incision close to the uvula and successive dissection of the tonsil from cranial to caudal with the bipolar forceps. Removal with bipolar forceps and insertion of a hydrogen swab. No further bleeding. Now repositioning for neck dissection on both sides, starting on the right. After abjoration, infiltration of 10 ml xylocaine plus adrenaline. Curved skin incision from the tip of the mastoid to just above the jugulum. Locate the omohyoid muscle, then the digastric muscle and finally the accessorius nerve. Expose the accessory nerve and detach the posterior neck preparation from the superior triangle of the accessory nerve. Work out successively from cranial to caudal while protecting the plexus branches. At the lower third, a large metastasis is encountered, which rests on the jugular vein and extends anteriorly. Now turn towards the metastasis and successive sharp dissection of the metastasis from the vessel. However, this is not clinically infiltrated, so the jugular vein is removed. After removal of the large metastasis and protection of the surrounding structures, further removal of the posterior neck preparation while protecting the plexus branches. Hemostasis with the bipolar forceps. Now complete the neck dissection in the sense of the anterior neck region II, III and IV. Dissection of the submandibular gland, taking its capsule with it. Now expose the hypoglossal nerve. The vagus nerve and the common carotid artery could be visualized during the preparation without any problems. As the laser resection was performed far laterally and the fatty tissue is already visible, the superior thyroid artery and lingual artery are now selectively ligated to prevent bleeding. Locate the two vessels after identifying the common carotid artery and identifying the external and internal carotid arteries. Now ligature both vessels. This was successful without any problems. Then flush with hydrogen and Ringer. Now turn to the left side. After a curved skin incision, also from the tip of the matoid to just above the jugulum, expose the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the digastric muscle. Now dissect the digastric muscle in the direction of the submandibular capsule and remove it. Locate the accessor nerve and expose it. Now work out the posterior neck preparation from cranial to caudal starting at the upper accessorius triangle. The plexus branches can also be spared. Also clearly enlarged lymph nodes despite the sonographic cN2a status. Removal of all lymph nodes. Removal of a lymph vessel caudally ................. Now freeing of the internal jugular vein. Complete the anterior neck preparation and expose the hypoglossal nerve. After removal of the neck preparation, hemostasis with the bipolar, hydrogen irrigation and ring irrigation. Now insertion of 2 Redon drains on both sides and two-layer wound closure. Finally, perform the tracheostomy. First inject 4 ml xylocaine and adrenaline 2 cm above the jugulum. Modified Kocher collar incision and transection of the subcutis. A large prethyroid vein is ligated. Then dissect the trachea and expose the thyroid isthmus, which is massively enlarged. Undermining of the thyroid gland and removal of the isthmus by means of two re-punctures. Entry into the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp. Creation of a modified Björ flap. Suturing or epithelization of the tracheostoma and insertion of an 8-gauge cannula. Finally, re-inspection of the base of the tongue and the tonsillar larynx, followed by discrete monopolar coagulation.

Patient identification, consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Carrying out the team time-out. Induction of anesthesia and intubation by anesthesia colleagues. Tracheobronchoscopy is not possible here if intubation conditions are difficult. Now intubation with the small bore tube. No suspicious mass in the oral cavity, oropharynx, base of tongue, vallecula, epiglottis, aryepiglottic f......s and postcricoid area. The mass/tumor grows from the pocket fold on the left, completely infiltrating the vocal fold and extending over the anterior commissure to the vocal fold on the right, growing circularly on the left and extending 2 cm to the subglottic area. Skin disinfection of the surgical area. Infiltration anesthesia in the area of the apron flap. Repeated skin disinfection of the surgical area and sterile draping of the surgical area. Now mark the landmarks, jugulum, mastoid, chin, sternocleidomastoid anterior border, jaw angle and mandibular branch on both sides and mark the apron flap up to approximately 2 to 3 cm cranial to the jugulum. Make the skin incision using an electric needle through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequently, further preparation of the neck dissection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First cut through the platysma and develop the apron flap subplatysmal to cranial. This is fixed with holding sutures. Then expose the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid and dissect along it. Exposure of the omohyoid and exposure of the right mandibular salivary gland. Exposure of the digaster venter muscle anteriorly and posteriorly. Visualization of the auricularis magnus. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and protection of the same. Demonstration of findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. He recommends dissecting only level II from the jugular vein medially and an identical procedure on the opposite side. This is carried out. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, the jugular vein and the facial vein. All structures are spared. An enlarged lymph node is located in the jugulofacial angle, which does not appear to be primarily suspicious. This neck specimen is sent for final histology. Now identical procedure on the opposite side. The external jugular vein is exposed and spared. The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid, the omohyoid and the posterior and anterior digaster venter muscles and the mandibular salivary gland as well as the hypoglossus and the accessorius are also exposed and spared. The neck preparation is also dissected medially from the jugular vein and cranially from the bifurcation to the medial side. A lymph node is also enlarged here, but not suspicious. The facial vein and internal jugular vein are also exposed and spared here. Now expose the omohyoid muscle and skeletonize it. The tumor is now resected: the hyoid bone is exposed and the infrahyoid muscles are dissected on both sides, detached from the larynx and folded laterally and caudally. Detachment of the supraglottic soft tissues up to the pharyngeal wall. The soft tissues go with the larynx to the specimen. Expose the thyroid isthmus and cut it. Dissect the thyroid gland together with the overlying infrahyoid musculature caudolaterally from the laryngeal skeleton. This is done in the same way on both sides. Individual branches of the superior thyroid artery are supplied or ligated bipolarly, the artery remains intact on both sides. Exposure of the trachea on the upper 4 to 5 cm. The trachea is now opened in the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space with epithelialization of the caudal part. No tumor here. Then expose the cornu superius on both sides and detach the pharyngeal muscles or the constrictor pharyngis on both sides. Push off the piriform sinus on both sides. Subsequent entry into the pharyngeal space at the level of the epiglottis. Exposure of the tumor. Successive development of the larynx. Detachment below the postcricoid region from the esophageal tube. Subsequent separation of the larynx from the trachea, which remains slightly elongated dorsally towards the cranium. Larynx is suture-marked for frozen section. In the frozen section, the tumor is relatively close dorsally in the area of the cricoid cartilage, no tumor infestation in the area of the trachea, here the clearly subglottically growing carcinoma is tumor-free or removed in healthy tissue. Resection of soft tissue on the esophageal tube from paramedian right to left is now performed again. A portion of the caudal hypopharynx in the area of the postcricoid mucosa is also removed again. Both specimens are sent for frozen section. No more tumor infiltrates here, so the tumor is finally removed from the healthy tissue. The myotomy is now performed in the typical manner on the left. Significantly improved by passage of the finger. Muscle bundles are cut through to the mucosa. Subsequent insertion of an 8 mm Provox prosthesis in the typical manner without problems. Good fit. Then 1st inverting suture with 4.0 Vicryl single button sutures inverting. A 2nd inverting suture of the musculature is performed over the 1st suture, also in single button sutures with Vicryl 3.0. Then a 3rd suture with adaptation of the constrictor pharyngis musculature, suprahyoidal constrictor pharyngis muscle is also adapted to the supraglottic musculature. The thyroid gland is adapted caudally over the suture area. Subsequent careful irrigation and hemostasis of the entire area. Wound closure in layers without insertion of a Redon drain in each side of the neck and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Finally, insertion of a 10 mm tracheostomy tube. The procedure was completed without complications. Overall cT3 to 4 transglottic carcinoma on the left side, no clear clinical lymph node involvement observed. Further procedure after receipt of the final histology. Presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference. Postoperatively, the patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Nutrition here via the inserted gastric tube for 10 days, then gruel swallowing and, if necessary, diet build-up. Please continue antibiotics, which were started intraoperatively with Unacid, for 1 week.","Laryngectomy, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy

Transition to tracheotomy: X-shaped skin incision. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Spreading of the pretracheal muscles. Identification of the cricoid cartilage. The thyroid isthmus is revealed very far caudally and is only bipolized. Then open the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Formation of a Björk flap and epithelialization of the flap using six tracheostomy sutures. PEG placement: Flexible esophagogastroscopy. After positive diaphanoscopy, placement of the PEG tube in the typical manner using the thread pull-through method. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Subsequent combined transoral transcervical tumor resection: First dissection of the pharyngeal wall and dissection of all vessels from the outside. Cut around the tumor from the inside transorally as far as possible. This can be done cranially and along the lower jaw. Controlled dissection from the inside to the outside. Inclusion of the entire pharyngeal wall. Extraction of the tumor into the soft tissues of the neck. Further resection with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm on all sides. The tonsil lobe, pharyngeal side wall, glossotonsillar groove and base of the tongue up to half as well as parts of the vallecula and the pharyngeal wall up to the hypopharyngeal entrance were removed. As part of the resection, the submandibular gland was also resected as well as parts of the external tongue musculature with parts of the hyoid bone. The tumor is thread-marked after resection. Marginal samples are taken from the hypopharynx and from the area of the pharyngeal wall extending to the uvula, from the base of the tongue, from the body of the tongue and a marginal sample from the alveolar ridge, which extends to the base of the tongue via the glossotonsillar groove. No evidence of carcinoma in any of the marginal samples. No high-grade dysplasia. Therefore R0 situation. After measuring the defect in its three-dimensional dimensions, removal of the radial lobe on the left forearm: Flap length maximum 10 cm, width maximum 7 cm. Flap shape is adjusted to the defect towards the floor of the mouth and base of the tongue. First cut ulnarly and lift subfascially. The ulnar artery is carefully spared. The incision is then extended into the antecubital fossa. First expose the superficial venous system and dissect it. Then expose the pedicle under the brachioradialis. Then incision of the flap from radial and subfascial elevation. The antebrachial cutaneous nerve is carefully spared. Caudal clamping of the radial artery. Saturation always at 100%. After approx. 15 minutes without a drop in saturation, the radial artery is removed. This is stitched and ligated with 4.0 Ethilon single button sutures. This is done both proximally and distally. Lift the flap subfascially with the pedicle and superficial venous system successively up to the antecubital fossa. Outgoing vessels are either ligated, bipolar coagulated or treated with a clip. Exposure in the antecubital fossa, connection between superficial and deep venous system. Exposure of the radial artery. The interosseous artery is first clamped off and can be supplied with clips and cut after a constant saturation of 100%. No confluence of the radial artery can be shown. Two outlets from the area of the cephalic vein can be visualized, which can be considered as connecting vessels. The flap is then removed. The veins are ligated. The artery is treated with 6.0 Vascufil stitches. Careful hemostasis is then performed. Removal of an appropriately sized piece of full-thickness skin from the groin area. After skin mobilization, the skin is closed in several layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. The full-thickness skin is inserted into the forearm defect after appropriate thinning. Fixation using 4.0 Ehtilon sutures. Skin closure up to the crook of the elbow in layers. Application of a hydrogel/Mepilex dressing. Application of Wölkchen compresses on top.

Therefore indication for the above-mentioned operation.,"After induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues, the surgeon first performs a tracheoscopy using the 0 degree scope. Tracheoscopy is only possible up to approx. 1 cm subglottically. Here, the mucosal conditions are unremarkable with no evidence of stenosis. Subsequent nasal intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Start of flexible esophagogastroscopy. Careful screening with the flexible endoscope through the oesophagus into the stomach. Chronic inflammatory mucosa on all sides of the stomach in the form of gastritis with no evidence of exophytic masses. Retraction of the flexible gastroscope and detailed inspection of the esophagus. Mucosal conditions unremarkable on all sides. Position the patient and first inspect the oral cavity. This reveals a carcinoma of the edge of the tongue on the right side, which occupies approximately the anterior third of the tongue and extends just to the midline, appearing coarse on palpation, with no abnormalities on palpation of the floor of the mouth and the base of the tongue. Entry with the type C small bore tube and inspection of the oropharynx and hypopharynx. Epiglottis, vallecula and base of tongue free on both sides, the piriform sinus can also be freely unfolded on both sides, the arytenoid region and postcricoid as well as the esophageal entrance are also free. Endolaryngeal protrusion is extremely difficult even with the type D small bore tube. The anterior commissure cannot be seen, otherwise inconspicuous mucosal conditions and smooth vocal folds without exophytic masses. Subsequent transition to excision biopsy of the right edge of the tongue. Insertion of an oral retractor and looping of the tongue with a Vicryl suture. Marking of the resection margins using monopolar coagulation and palpation. Subsequent excision of the tongue tumor after bipolar coagulation with scissors. Ligation of a small vein in the area of the floor of the mouth and suture marking of the removed tongue resectate. A resectate is obtained in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth.

Adjustment of the endolarynx with the Kleinsasser B and JA tube. Demonstration of the findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. This shows tumor growth in the area of the right vocal fold, which occupies the entire right vocal fold and extends to the vocal process. Towards the anterior commissure, this appears to be reached. Laterally, the tumor is palpable in the area of the ventricle. Subsequently, a decision was made to perform an open partial laryngectomy. Subsequent sterile washing and draping. Serrated vertical skin incision with exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature, which is pushed apart along the linea alba. Then expose the laryngeal skeleton by pushing the cricothyroid muscle from the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage to the thyrohyoid membrane. Incision of the periosteum or perichondrium so that a right pedicled perichondrium flap of the thyroid cartilage is formed. Enter the subperichondrial layer in the area of the thyroid incisura and dissect caudally. Then pass through the thyrofissure in the median plane so that the thyroid cartilage can be pushed apart. There is no clinical evidence of infiltration in the area of the anterior commissure. Entry into the interior of the larynx in the area of the thyroid incisura. From here, the incision is first made caudally in a vertical direction and the anterior commissure is included in the resection. In this way, the tumour can be successively visualized. The resection proceeds to the right, including the perichondrium in the area of the medial half of the right half of the thyroid cartilage. The tumor is then removed caudally in the area of the subglottis as well as cranially, whereby the resection includes parts of the ventriculus laryngeus. Finally, the tumor and thus the entire vocal fold is removed dorsally using the Kittel scissors with resection of the vocal process on the arytenoid cartilage. Macroscopically, the resection margins are not suspicious. The entire specimen is then thread-marked and mounted on cork for a frozen section histological examination. The dorsal part of the subglottic resection margin still shows carcinoma extensions. A subglottic dorsal resection is therefore performed. Lateral to this resection, further marginal samples are taken as well as a further marginal sample in the area of the remaining arytenoid cartilage. These proved to be free of tumor and dysplasia in the frozen section histological examination, so that an R0 resection can be assumed here. Finally, careful hemostasis by bipolar coagulation. Sealing of the wound surface on the right side with fibrin glue. Drill holes are made for readaptation of the thyroid cartilage. Insertion of a Keel after appropriate individual modeling. Readaptation of the thyroid cartilage skeleton at the previously created cranial and caudal drill holes. Refixation of the ligamentum conicum to the caudal edge of the thyroid cartilage. Knock-back of the perichondrium flap, which is additionally fixed with fibrin glue. Multi-layer wound closure of the straight prelaryngeal musculature after insertion of a drainage flap. Finally, multi-layer skin suture. Sterile wound dressing. End of the operation and transfer of the patient to anesthesia after placement of a nasogastric feeding tube and microlaryngoscopic control of the dry wound bed endolaryngeally. Conclusion: Complete right chordectomy for right vocal fold carcinoma via thyrofissure. Inclusion of the anterior commissure as well as the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage. Control microlaryngoscopy in 8 weeks.","Frontolateral laryngeal partial resection/Chordectomy

The PEG is inserted and secured using the usual technique. Then transition to tracheostoma placement. After skin disinfection, infiltration with local anesthetic containing adrenaline in the area of the subsequent skin incision as well as the tracheostoma. Sterile washing and draping. Skin incision approx. 2 QF above the jugulum. Sharp dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue down to the prelaryngeal musculature. This is divided along the linea alba. Exposure of the very strong isthmus of the thyroid gland. The isthmus is then passed under the pretracheal lamina, clamped and repositioned. This clearly exposes the upper trachea and the cricoid cartilage. The visor tracheotomy is then performed between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of the mucocutaneous anastomosis with 2 sutures each cranially and caudally. Problem-free reintubation of the patient. Then transition to tumor resection. Here, the tumor is positioned with the tonsil retractor. The ulcerative tumor in the area of the right oropharynx, dorsal to the posterior mandibular molar, is not very well defined. First start with caudal tumor resection. The adjacent base of the tongue is biopsied first, which is found to be tumor-free on frozen section histology, as is the adjacent maxilla. Now first cut around the resection margins caudally in the area of the medial base of the tongue in a lateral direction towards the mandible. The mucosa of the lateral floor of the mouth is incised up to the penultimate premolar. The resection is then guided laterally over the gingiva between the last and penultimate molars and continues in an arc over the adjacent buccal mucosa cranially to the maxilla. From there, the right soft palate is parauvularly incised almost to the midline. The resection then proceeds, including the posterior palatal arch, to the back wall of the pharynx, where it is then rejoined at the lower pole of the tonsil or base of the tongue. During resection, the last morale on the right side is then removed. The tumor is then successively resected along these borders together with the surrounding soft tissue. The posterior part of the lingual nerve is exposed and must also be resected in order to maintain an appropriate safety distance. Finally, the tumor can be completely removed by pushing the periosteum away from the mandible and thus completely exposing the mandibular angle from the medial side down to the bare bone. Multiple frozen section histological samples are taken from the surrounding resection margin as well as from the base of the tumor, all of which prove to be tumor-free. The last molar on the right side is then extracted and the adjacent mandible is ground out with the drill and smoothed. Also the root canals. After tumor resection, measurement of a 9 x 6.5 cm long radial flap graft, which will be lifted from the left forearm by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Distal skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Expose the cephalic vein and dissect radially from it. Exposure of the muscle bellies of the flexor carpi radialis and brachioradialis muscles and exposure of the venous star as well as exposure of the pedicle in depth. Now free dissection of the muscle bellies distally and exposure of the complete pedicle. Dissection of the cephalic vein and the radial vein as potential connecting vessels. Exposure of the brachial and ulnar arteries and exposure of the proximal end of the radial artery. Clipping of small perforator vessels and ligation of larger veins and arteries. Now ulnar recutting of the flap while sparing the ulnar artery and dissection up to the flexor carpi radialis tendon. Now also radially recut the flap and follow the cephalic artery distally. This is included in the subcutaneous fatty tissue of the graft. The R. superficialis of the radial nerve can be preserved with its two branches. Separation of the cephalic vein distally. Complete removal of the transplant. Finally, removal of the radial artery distally and proximally and removal of the two venous outlets. Ligation of the vascular stumps. Arm closure after careful hemostasis using a split-thigh skin graft of the right thigh, which was obtained in the usual manner. Application of a plaster splint. Good recapillarization time after removal of the flap. Subsequent transition to neck dissection on the right side. After skin incision, dissection and skeletonization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then expose the cervical vascular nerve sheath caudally and dissect cranially, sparing all non-lymphatic structures. Regions II to V are thus completely cleared out first. Submandibulectomy and removal of region I are then performed. In the area of the submandibular lobe, the pharyngeal passage into the defect is also found. Insertion of a Redon suction drainage. Subsequently, transition to neck dissection on the left side. Here, regions II to V are completely evacuated while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. After placement of the radial lobe graft, it is then inserted into the oropharyngeal defect from the lateral side via the previously created access and initially fixed to its cranial attachment site with several sutures. Then suture via the transcervical access of the caudal flap edge. Finally, the flap is fixed in position with the remaining sutures from the transoral side. The microvascular anastomosis is then performed. The arterial anastomosis is performed with the ascending pharyngeal artery, as both the superior thyroid artery and the facial artery are extremely small in caliber. The venous anastomoses are performed in the usual manner via 2 veins to the internal jugular vein using the end-to-side technique. Finally, insertion of a drainage flap in the right side of the neck. Two-layer wound closure. End of the operation, transfer of the patient to the anesthesia department after the patient has been reintubated onto an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube, which is sutured to the skin. Prior to this, wound closure on the left side after insertion of a Redon suction drain. End of the operation, transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Transoral tumor resection of a cT3 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right side in the region of the mandibular angle with extraction of the last molar from the right mandible and corresponding grinding of the adjacent bone. Microvascular reconstruction with a radial flap graft from the left forearm and defect coverage on the left forearm with split skin from the right thigh, creation of a tracheostoma and a PEG.","Transoral tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy, PEG placement

After induction of anesthesia, the tumor is inspected again. This extends from the soft palate close to the uvula down to the lower tonsillar pole with transition via the glossotonsillar groove to the base of the tongue. Laterally, the tumor appears to extend to the posterior molars. After insertion of the tonsil retractor and insertion of the monopolar electric needle, the tumor is cut around far into the healthy tissue and removed, taking the uvula, the soft palate on the left up to the hard palate border and the upper alveolar ridge, from here to the lower alveolar ridge. Removal of the last molar and preparation via the glossotonsillar groove to the base of the tongue. Removal of the tonsil in its capsule. Mucosa up to the buccal mucosa and the floor of the mouth as a post-resection. Then take lateral and medial edge samples. These are now found to be tumor-free. To confirm the R0 situation, the bed of the two extracted molars is now removed from the medial side to the lateral corticalis with the rose bur, taking the corticalis with it, so that a safe R0 resection appears to be given. Intraoperative demonstration on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Removal of the tonsil plug. The bridge of the maxilla breaks out at the front. It becomes apparent that the tooth roots could not be preserved, so these are also removed. A residual root may have remained on the left paramedian side. Therefore, request a postoperative maxillofacial consultation. In the further course, repositioning for neck dissection, starting on the left side: skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Laborious exploration of the neck vessels and preservation of the same for later defect coverage. Dissection in the accessorius triangle and exploration of the accessorius, the hypoglossus and the cervical sinus. Dissection from the digaster to the caudal omohyoid. Removal of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the above-mentioned structures and the main plexus branches. Then dissect the capsule of the submandibular gland in the midline. Dissect caudally, preserving the above-mentioned structures and remove the medial neck preparation. Careful hemostasis and H2O2 irrigation. Now dissection on the right side, essentially identical. Here too, the accessorius nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, the cervical sinus and the cervical vascular sheath can be located and spared. After removal of the lateral and medial neck specimen in regions I to V, careful hemostasis, H2O2 irrigation and insertion of a Redon drain are performed. Subsequently, two-layer wound closure. Now perform the tracheotomy. Skin incision. Subcutaneous preparation of the prelaryngeal musculature. Push them apart in the midline. Dissection of the thyroid gland. Undermining of the thyroid gland, clamping, severing and repositioning of both thyroid globules. Now locate the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a Björk flap with the 3rd tracheal cartilage. Epithelialization of the stoma. Now the intubation is transferred to an LE tube. Then lift the radial flap by cutting around the skin island. Locate the radial artery. Clamp it with the bulldog and observe the saturation while the flap pedicle is dissected from caudal to cranial. Locate the flap pedicle in the crook of the elbow. A relatively small artery and even finer veins can be seen. Therefore, renewed demonstration on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Decision to lift and use the flap despite difficult conditions. Separation of the radial artery caudally and cranially. Subsequent transection of the same. Now separation of the vein. Dissection of the same. Now lift the split skin from the right groin. This is primarily closed by inserting a Redon drain. The split skin is sutured into the lifting defect of the forearm, the rest of the forearm is closed in two layers accordingly. The flap is then fitted into the lifting defect orally. Suturing in the area of the soft palate and the tonsil and caudally with covering of the exposed bone. Passing the flap pedicle through an artificial fistula between the mandible and the submandibular gland. Then dissection of the superior thyroid artery and the internal jugular vein in preparation for anastomization. The thyroid artery is then removed and an end-to-end anastomosis of the superior thyroid artery to the radial artery is performed. Then end-to-side anastomosis of the accompanying veins in their confluence with the internal jugular vein. This is achieved without any problems using 9/0 sutures as microsurgical re-anastomization. Finally, two-layer wound closure with insertion of a Redon drain on the left side of the neck and completion of the procedure with a vital flap and no indication of complications.","Resection of Tonsillar carcinoma, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

ENT examination and initiation of a panendoscopy. The panendoscopy revealed a tumor located mainly supraglottically, infiltrating primarily the left-sided pocket fold and spreading to the vocal fold, reaching the anterior commissure and also spreading to the right side. The main tumor mass grows submucosally. The tumor masses reach the left arytenoid cartilage. Due to the age and extent of the tumor, indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","Induction of anesthesia. Sterile washing and draping. Prior to this, the pharyngeal and laryngeal areas were inspected again with the small bore tube and the findings from the previous panendoscopy were confirmed. Creation of an apron flap and preparation of the platysma in the usual manner. Then start with the neck dissection on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and removal of the neck levels II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. Furthermore, the accessorius nerve and the hypoglossal nerve as well as the cervical sinus are spared. Unfortunately, the facial vein must be removed. Then release the hyoid bone on this side. Dissect the cervical vascular sheath from the pharyngeal and laryngeal area. Detach the thyroid gland from the larynx and turn to the opposite side. Similar procedure here. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and exposure of the submandibular gland and the omohyoid muscle. Detachment of the cervical vascular sheath from the larynx. Release of the hyoid bone and detachment of the thyroid gland from the larynx. Dissection of the anterior wall of the trachea and creation of a tracheotomy between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis in the caudal region. Release of the piriform sinus on the right side and also on the left side. This is only possible to a very limited extent on the left side, as tumor infiltration can already be felt here. Now palpate the pre-epiglottic fatty tissue and localize the epiglottis. Entry into the right paramedian pharynx. Incision of the mucosa along the edges of the epiglottis up to the postcricoid region. Detachment of the larynx from the pharynx and placement of the larynx below the cricoid cartilage. A marginal sample is taken in the area of the pharyngeal side wall towards the soft tissue, as the tumor was resected very close to the healthy tissue here. The edge sample is diagnosed as tumor-free by the pathologist. Now completion of the neck dissection on the right side. Free dissection of the internal jugular vein and removal of the level IIa to IV neck specimen while sparing the plexus branches. Accessory nerve, hypoglossal nerve and facial vein are also spared on this side. The superior thyroid artery is present on the right side. It must be severed on the left side. Now insert a size 6 Provox prosthesis (model no. 2). Perform a two-layer pharyngeal suture in the usual manner using single button sutures. Finally, reduction of the attachments of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the caudal region and retraction of the apron flap and formation of an epithelialized tracheostoma. Insertion of 2 Redon drains and skin suture in two layers. Please feed via the inserted nasogastric tube for 10 postoperative days, then carry out an X-ray pap-swallow examination and dietary reconstruction and present the patient to the tumor conference after receiving the histology. Continue antibiotics for 24 hours.","Laryngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Provox placement

The above-mentioned surgery was therefore indicated and laser resection was planned if the condition was well controlled.,"First, insertion of the Kleinsasser tube size C again after insertion of the mouthguard and assessment of the tumor. The exophytic tumor, which begins just before the ary on the right, is initially relatively flat, but then becomes significantly thicker and grows towards the supra- and subglottic area until it reaches the anterior commissure, also carcinoma on the opposite side, which could probably be a second separate tumor, because the mucosa directly in the anterior commissure appears to be inconspicuous over a very small area. This tumor also extends to just before the arytenoid region and is clearly thickened in the middle area, in contrast to the right side, where it is thickened in the middle to anterior area. Flat tumor in the dorsal area on the left. First resection of the tumor starting in the anterior commissure, here pushing the tumor away from the cartilage or also below from the area of the ligamentum conicum or up to the cricoid cartilage. Dorsally, the tumor is also resected on all sides with a safety margin of approx. 4 mm, whereby partial muscle tissue is still preserved dorsally, approaching the cartilage cranially, and resection up to the cartilage level at the very front. The tumor is also resected from the left dorsal side, whereby the tumor runs flat on the left dorsal side, mucosa with some soft tissue is resected here so that the muscles are largely preserved, with increasing resection of the soft tissue towards the front until the cartilage is reached again at the very front. The tumor is removed in its entirety and marked basally with sutures. Subsequently, supraglottic and subglottic anterior, supraglottic right and left, subglottic right and left, ary right and left marginal samples are taken. All marginal samples are sent for frozen section. No infiltrates visible in the frozen section, therefore R0 resection. There is still a remnant of soft tissue and vocal fold on both sides. Exposed cartilage or ring cartilage in the front. Therefore, insertion of a Dacron foil, which is fixed in the typical manner using sutures, which are passed outwards and knotted on the outside using a horizontal button. Check the position again. Good position of the Dacron foil. The hemostasis that was previously performed is now performed again. No evidence of bleeding on completion. A tracheostomy can be avoided despite the relatively extensive resection, with overall good adjustability and good intubation. No respiratory distress or dysphagia to be expected. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient received clindamycin preoperatively. Please continue the antibiotic treatment for one week if the cartilage is exposed at the front. Please leave the Dacron foil in place for 6-8 weeks, preferably removing it at the next MLE check-up after approx. 8 weeks. Wait for the final histology.

Injection of a total of 15 ml xylocaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. Sterile draping. Radical neck dissection on the left follows: Skin incision in the typical manner along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Extension at a 90° angle in the direction of the submandibular lobe. Subsequent exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular artery, internal and external carotid artery, vagus nerve, boundary cord of the accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. There is a large conglomerate of lymph nodes extending from caudal to cranial lateral to the cervical vascular sheath. It infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein and branches of the cervical plexus in the upper area. The internal jugular vein is dissected cranially and caudally from the tumor, is not affected here and is ligated twice. A caudal outlet remains in the direction of the thyroid gland. Cranial also double ligation. The internal carotid artery can be completely dissected. Caudal exposure of the thoracic duct or a large lymphatic vessel in the venous angle, which is ligated twice. The conglomerate is then removed laterally from the cervical vascular sheath, including the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein, the accessorius nerve and resection of the upper cervical plexus branches. Parts of the prevertebral, paravertebral musculature must also be removed. Here in the area of the strongest adherence of the lymph node preparation, marginal samples are taken, also from the upper end of the separated internal jugular vein. Both marginal samples are sent for frozen section. No tumor infiltrates here in the frozen section. All soft tissues, including parts of the trapezius muscle, were resected. Subsequent clearing of levels Ib and Ia, including the submandibular gland. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve and lingual nerve. Also preservation of the facial artery. Subsequent tumor resection: First exposure of the hyoid bone from the lateral or superior cornu. Insertion between hyoid bone and superior cornu. Exposure of the tumor. The tumor is incised on all sides with a safety margin of 1 to 1.5 cm. The entire lateral hypopharyngeal side wall and the posterior hypopharyngeal wall are removed; resection extends up to the base of the tongue and under the tonsillar lobe. Resection extends from the vallecula, next to the epiglottis downwards, including the aryepiglottic fold and the piriform sinus to the tip of the piriformis. The tumor is macroscopically removed from the healthy tissue and is thread-marked for frozen section. To be on the safe side, a lateral specimen is taken adjacent to the epiglottis, including parts of the base of the tongue and the cranial resection margin. In the frozen section, infiltrates in the lateral and cranial direction in the sense of a microinvasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ infiltrates. Therefore, resection laterally and cranially and removal of a marginal sample from the lateral, divided into lateral and caudal, including the remains of the arytenoid fold or the mucosa towards the postcricoid region and including further lateral parts of the epiglottis and vallecula region. Also resection again cranially and removal of a marginal sample, which extends from the base of the tongue over the lateral pharyngeal wall to the cranial border in the oropharynx. The frozen section is now free laterally, but there are still in situ infiltrates cranially. Therefore, another extensive resection of a wide mucosal strip is performed cranially. The marginal samples are taken transorally by inserting a Mc Ivor spatula. For this purpose, a cranial mucosal strip of the residual mucosa, which is already located behind the uvula, is removed as well as the residual tonsil and a strip from the side wall of the pharynx. All these marginal samples are sent to the frozen section again as a cranial marginal sample. No more tumor infiltrates here. Therefore, an R0 resection can now be assumed. Subsequently, resection of the 2nd carcinoma in the area of the arytenoid hump on the right. This is a flat, papillomatous carcinoma. This is macroscopically incised on all sides with a safety margin of several millimeters in healthy tissue and sent for frozen section examination with a suture marker. Here in the dorsal and lateral area still carcinoma in situ. Therefore, resection of the dorsal and lateral areas and removal of representative marginal samples. These are now tumor-free. Thus an R0 situation here too. However, extensive hypopharyngeal carcinoma with in situ can be assumed in the case of suspected field carcinoma and a second carcinoma in the case of suspected polycentric carcinoma. The residual mucosa in the postcricoid area is now readapted cranially as far as possible in order to achieve improved sensitivity and mucosal coverage using 5/0 Vicryl sutures. During the tumor resection, a plastic tracheostoma was created by reopening in the case of a post-dilatation tracheostomy. The old scar was reopened in the cranial region, the trachea was exposed and epithelialized in the 2nd and 3rd intercartilage space in a typical manner using a wide pedicle Björk flap. Insertion of a laryngectomy tube. Following the tumor resection Neck dissection on the right: Level II to IV as well as larger parts of V. Multiple suspicious nodes are also removed here. The internal jugular vein, internal/external carotid artery, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve, border cord and the branches of the cervical plexus were preserved here, as was the superior thyroid artery. A femoral flap was then removed from the left side to cover the defect. After measuring the defect, which required a size of 12 x 8 cm, a flap size of 17 x 8 cm was measured, as the flap is to be lifted with a skin island as a monitor. Several perforators can be displayed. The flap is outlined around the perforators. First cut medially through the skin and subcutis to the fascia. Dissect below the fascia up to the intermuscular septum. Widen the incision cranially and expose the vascular pedicle of the descending ramus. Also expose the perforators, which all extend through the musculature. The vascular pedicle is exposed up to the exit from the profunda femoris artery. Here the artery reaches a good thickness. Equally good venous confluence can be visualized. The flap is then incised laterally. After cutting through the fascia, a larger part of the vastus lateralis muscle is resected with the intermuscular course of the perforators, particularly in the caudal region. Outgoing branches are bipolarly coagulated or treated with a clip. The vascular pedicle is placed directly on the profunda femoris artery. Good reflux from the superficial circumflex iliac artery, which must be removed due to the anatomical conditions at the flap stalk. The associated veins are also removed. The vascular pedicle is then removed. All arteries and veins are supplied using 4/0 Prolene puncture ligatures. Flap is rinsed with heparin and preserved. The thigh wound is closed in layers after careful hemostasis and insertion of a Redon drain. The flap is then inserted into the defect and sutured into the defect without tension after the sutures have been placed. An approx. 5 cm wide, de-epithelialized bridge to a skin monitor was created in the caudal area. The defect was closed completely and with minimal tension. The vessels are connected after trimming and conditioning of the vessels. An end-to-end anastomosis is made between the superior thyroid artery, which was preserved during the radical neck dissection, and the descending ramus with 8/0 ethilon sutures. This is followed by the anastomosis between the main venous drainage vessel and the external jugular vein, which was also preserved during the neck dissection. A size 3/5 coupler is used for this. After arterial anastomosis good venous return via the vein, after venous anastomosis good venous return. Flap vital. This is followed by careful hemostasis. Overall, hemostasis is sometimes very difficult during the operation as there is constant and diffuse bleeding from the various tissue sections due to coagulation disorders. Skin closure of the neck wound on the right is achieved without any problems by inserting a Redon drain. Skin closure of the wound on the left with insertion of the skin monitor. However, due to the increased tissue tension in the middle area, a small portion of the skin remains unsutured to prevent compression of the flap. A flap was inserted on the left. The laryngectomy tube is replaced by a tracheostomy tube with a core, which is fixed with sutures. The procedure is completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Overall, due to continuous bleeding with impaired coagulation, need for blood reserves and coagulation factors. At the end of the operation, the jugular vein was easy to check with the Doppler at the marked site. The skin monitor was vital. Postoperatively, please continue antibiotics with Unacid i.v.. Feeding via the previously inserted PEG tube. Food build-up after swallowing porridge on the 10th day with unremarkable findings. The still dehisced wound area on the left cervical side can be closed secondarily after the swelling has subsided. Please carry out regular Doppler checks of the monitor postoperatively according to the scheme. Postoperative radio-chemotherapy is certainly necessary for mulicentric hypopharyngeal carcinoma and field cancerization.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheostomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (ALT)

Intubation of the patient. The supraglottis is adjusted with the small bore tube. A penetrating defect can be seen at the base of the epiglottis, at the transition to the vallecula. The entire inner surface of the epiglottis is affected by an exophytic tumor, which here occupies the right side somewhat preferentially, but clearly crosses the midline. The support autoscopy is removed and the patient is switched to a spreading laryngoscope. This allows the tumor to be exposed reasonably well. Circular resection is now performed with the CO2 laser. Due to the slightly restricted view, the position of the spreading laryngoscope has to be changed once during the operation. The resection extends over the aryepiglottic fold on the right side into the vallecula and the prelaryngeal fat on both sides. The arytenoid cartilage on the right side is skeletonized on the inside. On the left side, the ary remains completely covered by mucosa and untouched. Due to an infestation of the detachment margin on the right ary, which could not be ruled out, a subsequent resection had to be performed during the operation, which was also sent in for final histological findings, as was the main specimen. Macroscopically, all the margins of the deposit appear free. The caudal margin refers to the pocket fold on the left side across the commissure to the pocket fold on the right side. However, 95% of the pocket folds are preserved. Removal of sedimentation margin samples in the caudal sedimentation area and anteriorly to the pre-epiglottic fat. All the specimens taken from the edge of the sedimentation area are sent for frozen section diagnostics. Here, the intraoperative findings are that there is high-grade dysplasia in the settling margin of the pocket fold on the right side and in the area of the commissure of the pocket folds, which is why the pathologists would recommend a resection here. This is done without any problems after the spreading laryngoscope has been inserted again with the CO2 laser. The new samples taken from the margins are sent for final histopathological diagnosis. If the wound is dry, removal of the spreading laryngoscope and support autoscopy. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection. First injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline. Then skin incision, initially on the right side on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The dissection is performed subcutaneously far ventrally after an atheroma-like change becomes apparent here. This atheroma is removed from the subcutaneous tissue from the inside. A tiny skin injury is primarily treated with a suture. Subsequent layer-by-layer dissection in depth. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the posterior belly of the digaster muscle. Exposure of the glandular capsule of the submandibular gland. Subsequently, the examination reveals a lymph node conglomerate far caudally and one in the area of the venous angle. Both lymph node conglomerates are dissected laterally down from the cervical vascular sheath after it has been exposed. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath involves sparing the vagus nerve and all vascular structures. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the vagus nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. After the lymph node conglomerates have been dissected laterally from the vein, the lateral neck preparation with all easily palpable nodes is removed. This is done while sparing the accessorius nerve. The hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve are lifted out of their bed in the sense of a neurolysis and re-embedded after relocation. The accessorius triangle is also removed. Clearing of the hypoglossal triangle and development of the anterior neck preparation. All branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery are also protected. The preparation is sent together for diagnosis. Two-layer wound closure. Insertion of a Redon drainage. Application of a pressure dressing. Repositioning for neck dissection on the left side. This shows a cN0 neck status. Skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of all landmarks with the omohyoid muscle, the digaster muscle and the submandibular gland. Exposure and opening of the cervical vascular sheath. Long-distance dissection of the vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. All nerves are lifted out of their bed in the sense of a neurolysis and re-embedded. Release of the accessorius triangle and development of the entire lateral neck preaprate. The hypoglossal triangle is also released and then the entire anterior neck preparation is developed. Here too, the dissection is performed while sparing all branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery. There are no enlarged lymph nodes. The entire preparation is also sent for histopathological examination. Insertion of a Redon drainage. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure dressing. The result is a selective neck dissection of five levels on both sides. Due to the extent of the endolaryngeal resection and the potential swallowing problems to be expected, the decision was made to tracheotomize the patient. This is also performed after injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline pretracheally. Transverse skin incision and layer-by-layer preparation in depth. Exposure of the prelaryngeal and infralaryngeal muscles. This is separated in the middle. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is clamped on both sides, severed and ligated. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. The trachea is then opened between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp. Dissection of the Björ flap. Then circular suturing of the tracheostoma with several holding sutures. Insertion of a tracheostomy tube. Final consultation with the anesthetist.","Laser resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy

Then entry with the Mc Ivor oral spatula and inspection of the tonsil on the right side. An ulcer-like mass was found in the area of the right tonsil, with mucosal changes on the anterior and posterior palatal arches and superficial mucosal changes, even just to the parauvular level. The tumor was then cut around with a safety margin of 0.5 to 1 cm using a monopolar needle. In depth, the tumor must be dissected with bipolar forceps and scissors. In the area of the cranial tonsil pole, the resection extends into the soft tissues of the neck. Neck fat is revealed, then the entire tumor preparation is removed en bloc and deposited at the base of the tongue. The specimen is placed on cork for frozen section. In the area of the cranial tonsil pole, a resection specimen is taken, as the resection margins appear to be very narrow here. This is also thread-marked and placed on cork for a frozen section. Then take a margin sample from the depth in the area of the deepest resection site. In the frozen section all marginal samples are R0, in the area of the median margin of the posterior pharyngeal wall there is still at least moderate dysplasia and in consultation with the pathology department this should be resected again. Therefore, a strip of mucosa is removed here again, which is thread-marked (remote from the tumor) for final histology. During the frozen section break, a PEG was inserted with good diaphanoscopy and without complications. Please plan a second neck dissection on both sides and then present at the tumor conference.","Transoral tumor resection, PEG placement

After external pre-diagnosis in our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was recommended.","First inspection of the primary tumor region. This revealed a partially ulcerated process of the right edge of the tongue, measuring approx. 2 x 4 cm in total with infiltration of a good 1-1.5 cm in depth; the lateral and posterior floor of the mouth was largely free and regular. There is also no infiltration of the glossotonsillar groove. Good exposure possibility. The tongue is now snared transorally. Incision of the tumor with a safety margin of a good 1 cm, also in the depth of a soft tissue mantle of 1 cm on all sides. Ligation of an arterial and a venous side branch and removal of the tumor macroscopically on all sides in sano, which is thread-marked on all sides for frozen section diagnostics. Here, all margins including the basal margin are diagnosed as tumor- and dysplasia-free, hence a clear R0 situation. Later, after final inspection and wound irrigation, the adapting mucosa is used to compress the wound surface. The lateral floor of the mouth is easily displaceable and there is no penetrating defect, so there is no indication for reconstruction here. Turn to the right side first for neck dissection. Skin incision made at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma, exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the facial vein, the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve and the cervical nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle, free preparation of the internal jugular vein with exposure of the external and internal carotid artery, which shows a clear kinking with a lateral course. Exposure of the vagus nerve, clearing of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Finally, evacuation of level Ib. Dislocation of the submandibular gland, evacuation of the level with careful protection of the ramus marginalis mandibulae. Final wound inspection and wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Turn to the opposite side. In principle, the same procedure is used here. After exposing and preserving the external jugular vein and auricular nerve, expose the limited musculature. Then remove the anterior neck preparation and preserve the V. facialis, A. thyroidea superior, N. hypoglossus. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, here the vascular tissue is left in place and level IIb is therefore only partially cleared out. Careful dissection of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the vagus nerve and the course of the internal carotid artery exactly as described on the opposite side. Clear kinking here too. Deposition of the specimen at the transition to level Va with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Here too, final wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drainage and careful two-layer wound closure.

The tongue is disluxed after setting the mouth retractors. Now look at the ulcer measuring approx. 2 x 2 cm on the left edge of the tongue, approximately in the middle. The tumor is then resected macroscopically 1 1/2-2 cm from the resection margin on all sides. The healthy musculature is viewed macroscopically. Suture marking of the specimen, which is sent in for frozen section histology diagnostics. Tumor infiltrates can still be seen in the ventral margin and in depth to the internal musculature as well as lymphangiosis towards the floor of the mouth in a lateral direction. Corresponding resections are then carried out at the corresponding sites, followed by renewed marginal samples further laterally. All of the marginal samples proved to be tumor-free. In the resection of the tumor base, isolated disseminated tumor nests are found in healthy muscles. However, the defect now covers the entire left tongue up to just before the base of the tongue, so that further resection is not possible. The remaining right tongue body is then adapted again in several layers with mattress sutures and sutured to the left resection margin. In the meantime, after disinfecting the skin, a sample is taken from the mass in the right envelope fold. After skin incision, the mass is dissected under the skin and removed. A frozen section histology also reveals a carcinoma corresponding to that in the tongue. Histologically for the time being. Careful hemostasis by bipolar coagulation. Two-layer wound closure. Sterile dressing. Subsequent transition to tracheostomy. The patient cannot be intubated either conventionally or with the GlideScope. Only flexible bronchoscopy. In addition, postoperative dysphagia with aspiration is to be expected due to the extensive tongue resection. A tracheostoma is therefore created. After skin incision, preparation of the linea alba. The muscles are pushed apart. Pass under the isthmus and place in the midline. Thus exposing the first 4 tracheal clasps. Opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasps. Completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Removal of the tube and problem-free intubation of the patient onto a 9-gauge cannula.

Subsequent entry with rigid endoscopy. Inspection of the subglottic slope and trachea. Unobtrusive conditions. Now nasal intubation. Subsequent inspection of the oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx, also under the microscope. The previously described tumor of the right tonsil is seen, which ends at the lower tonsil pole, but extends palpatorily, as already recognized on CT, far to the submucosal cranial side and infiltrates here into the palate on the right side, but does not cross the midline here. Subsequent flexible esophagoscopy. Unobtrusive conditions as far as the stomach. After performing the diaphanoscopy and insertion of the troicart, the PEG is inserted in the typical manner using the thread pull-through method. The tumor is then positioned with the tonsil retractor and cut around with the electric needle. Dissection from cranial to caudal, cutting around the tumor with a large safety margin. Laterally, the tumor does not appear to be growing beyond the capsule of the tonsil, so that the tumor can be removed in toto from the pharyngeal wall with the raspatory without difficulty. Removal of the tumor caudally. Subsequent formation of a resectate in the cranial part, which is also sent for final histology. Finally, the edge samples are taken. These are found to be tumor-free. Now turn to the neck dissection on the left side: To do this, make a skin incision in the typical manner along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Expose the same. Dissection of the neck sheath. Exposure of the accessory nerve, vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Dissection of the lateral neck preparation from the digaster to the omohyoid, sparing the above-mentioned structures and the main plexus branches. Careful hemostasis. Evacuation of the medial neck preparation, taking the capsule of the submandibular gland with it and again careful hemostasis, H2O2 irrigation and insertion of a Redon drain. Finally, two-layer wound closure. Now neck dissection on the right side: identical procedure here. Also dissection from the digaster to the omohyoid. Expose the cervical vascular sheath, the vagus nerve, the accessorius nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. Clearing out the lateral neck preparation while protecting the structures and the plexus branches. Careful hemostasis. Dissection along the capsule of the submandibular gland in a medial direction and removal of the medial neck preparation. Subsequent careful hemostasis. H2O2 irrigation. Finally, this wound is left open and the vascular trunk of the superior thyroid is explored. This can be seen at the level of the bulb, leaving the externa and sufficiently wide and pulsating well; the internal jugular vein is also visualized. Insertion of H2O2 swabs and turning to the tracheotomy: For this purpose, skin incision with dissection through the subcutis and pushing apart the prelaryngeal muscles. Undermining of the thyroid gland. Insertion of clamps. Cutting of the same in the midline. Subsequent repositioning. After locating the anterior wall of the trachea, the incision is made between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Form a Björk flap in the typical manner and skin adaptation to the trachea to form an epithelialized stoma. Now reintubation with an 8-gauge Rügheimer cannula. Then lift the radial flap. To do this, cut around the skin preparation. Remove the fascia from the musculature. Locate the radial artery. Then follow it into the crook of the elbow and release it from its bed. The radial artery is deposited in the antecubital fossa before the interosseous artery leaves. The accompanying veins are placed in a confluence. Careful hemostasis is then performed. Heparin irrigation. Attachment of the perfusor. Due to ABC intolerance, full heparinization is performed here. Now lift the split skin from the groin. This defect is sutured primarily after careful hemostasis and insertion of a Redon drainage. Split skin coverage of the forearm. The skin is then sutured down to the crook of the elbow. Application of a forearm splint. Fitting of the skin preparation into the defect. Reconstruct the palatal arch and, after undermining, pull the flap pedicle through towards the neck. Anastomize the radial artery with the superior thyroid artery microscopically. Then end-to-end, then end-to-side anastomosis of the accompanying veins in their confluence with the jugular artery. After careful hemostasis and checking for good flow, H2O2 irrigation is performed again and the wound is closed in two layers. Check the wound again at the end of the procedure. No evidence of bleeding. Flap vital.","Tumor resection of right tonsil, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy, PEG placement, Panendoscopy

The biopsy of the mass on the underside of the tongue showed histologically detectable infiltrates of a moderately differentiated, small focal and keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Sonographically, no space-occupying lesion could be visualized on the floor of the mouth with a cN0 neck status; in addition, a primarily non-suspicious mass of the thyroid gland on the right side measuring 24 x 16 x 24 mm was found sonographically. Therefore, indication to perform a panendoscopy with excision of the histologically confirmed malignant mass on the underside of the tongue. However, after consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, a coarse needle biopsy of the right-sided thyroid nodule was initially not performed during the operation as the patient's malignant disease should be treated first.","After problem-free induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues, a rigid tracheoscopy is performed first. For this purpose, an O° scope was inserted and the trachea inspected, which was free, non-irritated and clearly visible up to the carina. Finally, withdrawal of the rigid endoscope if there is no evidence of an exophytically growing mass. Removal of the endoscope and intubation by the surgeon. The patient's head is then placed in a low position and a flexible esophagogastroscopy is performed. For this, a flexible endoscope is inserted into the stomach under visualization. A regular mucosal relief can be seen in the stomach. The endoscope is advanced as far as the pylorus, where conditions are also unremarkable. Then carefully withdraw the flexible endoscope and inspect the esophago-gastric junction. Discrete signs of chronic reflux esophagitis. However, no evidence of an exophytic or ulcerating mass. Then careful withdrawal of the flexible endoscope and inspection of the esophagus, here as far as possible inconspicuous mucosal conditions. Then remove the flexible endoscope, insert a mouth guard and perform a pharyngo- and laryngoscopy. For this purpose, a Kleinsasser C-tube is inserted and the oral cavity region, the floor of the mouth and the upper pharyngeal sections are inspected. A slightly spherical and broad-based, rough mass approx. 1 x 1 cm on the median underside of the tongue sitting directly on the frenulum lingulae, which also shows a cone-shaped extension towards the carunculae. The rest of the floor of the mouth as well as the tongue, oral vestibule, tonsillar lobes, palatal arches and uvula are intact and without irritation. The deeper pharynx with the posterior pharyngeal wall region, the piriform sinus entrances and hypopharyngeal walls on both sides are also unremarkable and without irritation. The arytenoid region, aryepiglottic fold and epiglottis are also non-irritant and inconspicuous. The glottis itself is also non-irritating and inconspicuous. Then removal of the Kleinsasser C-tube and the mouth guard and finally turning to the tumorous mass. First demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First, an anterior duct incision of the wharton's duct is performed on both sides after the tumor reaches the caruculae with an extension. The duct is slit on both sides without any problems. The slit duct section is marsupialized. The mass is then successively removed in toto with the scissors with a sufficiently wide safety margin and bipolar coagulation of the feeding vessels. The marsupialized duct tissue is spared. The preparation is then thread-marked for final histology. Extensive hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation with absolutely dry wound conditions, then termination of the procedure with repositioning of the patient's head. Summarizing remarks: During the operation, a panendoscopy was performed with unremarkable findings and an excision in toto of the already confirmed squamous cell carcinoma on the underside of the tongue. In addition, an anterior duct incision of the wharton's duct was performed on both sides. The patient was advised to undergo intensive gland massage postoperatively. Waiting for the definitive histology, if necessary resection and initially further thyroid clarification by means of a scintigraphy before planning a coarse needle biopsy.","Panendoscopy with excisional biopsy

This reveals extensive tumor growth, starting at the posterior pharyngeal wall, at the level of the epiglottis, occupying the entire postcricoid, but leaving the arytenoid humps exposed for more than 1 cm each. The tumor extends through both piriform recesses to the esophageal entrance. Due to the fact that the larynx is not completely covered and the medial piriform recess is not reached by the tumor on either side, the decision is made to preserve the larynx and to perform a complete pharyngectomy in the sense of tumor resection via lateral pharyngotomy from the right. A Gluck-Soerensen incision is now made and the right cervical vascular nerve sheath is dissected. Due to the previous operations and the radiotherapy, a correspondingly scarred picture is seen. Nevertheless, the internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery, bulb, external and internal arteries can be fully visualized. The external artery still shows the superior thyroid artery and the maxillary lingual and facial arteries as outlets. The hypoglossal nerve is also exposed and spared. The hyoid bone is now further dissected and half the hyoid bone is removed for further resection and treatment. Half of the thyroid cartilage is also skeletonized on the right side and the hypopharynx is released. Strict care is taken to ensure that no lesions occur, particularly in the area of the anterior thyroid cartilage. However, as already mentioned, the right thyroid cartilage is removed for further resection of the tumor while preserving the bow. This is followed by a pharyngotomy from the right above the hyoid bone and exposure of the underlying tumor. Complete bypass of the tumor in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall and complete pharyngectomy in the sense of a circular pharyngeal resection, leaving postcricoid mucosa of approx. 1 cm below the arytenoid cartilage. The remaining tissue is now completely removed and traced down to the esophageal entrance. Approx. 2 cm of the esophageal entrance is also resected due to the tumor growth ending 1 cm above it. The esophagus is fixed with sutures to enable later reanastomization and reconstruction with the flap graft. Quick incisions are taken, which are finally reported as tumor-free. Furthermore, the radialis graft to be lifted is now measured for reconstruction. The result is a modified trapezoidal graft measuring 11 by 8 cm and 6 cm in length. This is then incorporated circularly in the form of a funnel. A small, so-called flap key is formed in the area of the esophagus to prevent subsequent re-stenosis in this area. The graft on the left forearm is now lifted in a bloodless state in the typical manner. Once the graft has been removed and the bleeding has been stopped, it is gradually incorporated, first in the area of the esophageal entrance and then in the hypo-/oropharyngeal area. This ensures good and complete wound closure. In order to mobilize the larynx slightly cranially towards the base of the tongue, the cricoid cartilage is now grasped submucosally with a 0 suture and sutured to the base of the tongue, taking the remaining hyoid bone with it. This results in a clearly visible cranial displacement of the larynx, which should enable the patient to swallow more easily. After closure, the anastomosis is performed accordingly. This involves an end-to-end anastomosis of the lingual artery with the radial artery using single button sutures and an end-to-side anastomosis using a 3.5 mm vascular couplas. Finally, good vascular flow is established and the skin and subcutaneous sutures are applied. As part of the skin suture, the skin monitor of the flap is also integrated into the neck wound. Finally, the Doppler signals are checked, which are documented and are good. Parallel to the incorporation of the flap, <CLINICIAN_NAME> lifts the full-thickness skin in the area of the right groin and incorporates it in the area of the left forearm to cover the lifting defect. A vacuum seal is now applied and activated. Application of a Cramer splint to immobilize the forearm and hand.

The above-mentioned operation was therefore indicated.,"Introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. First, pharyngoscopy again: Relatively flat, exophytic tumor is seen in the area of the left uvula, growing towards the anterior and posterior palatal arch, but overall rather superficial growth. Now transoral resection: tumor is removed macroscopically on all sides in healthy tissue with a safety margin of 1 cm. The entire tonsil is resected caudally. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section. Here all margins in healthy tissue. Overall, the findings are now borderline with regard to defect coverage using a radial flap. Anterior and posterior palatal arch partially preserved. Due to this borderline function, decision to refrain from flap coverage for the time being. Wait and see whether regurgitation or dysphagia develops. In any case, neck dissection at intervals of one to two weeks, then with flap coverage if necessary. Finally, careful hemostasis again. On final inspection, no further evidence of blood flow. Final consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Completion of the procedure without complications.","Transoral resection

Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. First of all, insertion with the small water tube and adjustment of the tumor region. The tumor is extremely difficult to position with the small water tube, making laser resection impossible. In addition, the tumor covers large parts of the right base of the tongue and extends laterally to the metastasis coming from the neck, so that laser resection is not recommended for this reason either. In addition, this would result in a very large defect that would be worth covering anyway. Entering with the flexible gastroesophagoscope and pre-scanning into the stomach. Insertion of a PEG using the thread pull-through method. This is successful with good diaphanoscopy. Application of a wound dressing. Start with neck dissection on the right side. The tumor is marked transorally beforehand. Large lymph node conglomerates with infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle can be seen. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is therefore initially removed caudally. Lymph node conglomerates can be dissected from the omohyoid muscle. Dissection of the larynx. First expose the medial digastric muscle or the hypoglossal nerve. Laborious dissection of the lymph nodes from the structures that can initially be preserved. Then dissection of the tendon of the digastric muscle. Then dissection from the dorsal side. Co-resection of the lower parotid pole and removal of the sternocleidomastoid muscle cranially. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath from the caudal side. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, common carotid artery, later the internal and external carotid artery. The internal jugular vein is infiltrated from the middle and is initially set off caudally and ligated twice. Further dissection cranially along the carotid artery. The internal and external carotid arteries can be dissected, but parts of the branches of the external carotid artery are infiltrated. The superior thyroid artery and lingual artery can be preserved. The facial and superficial temporal arteries must also be removed in the other small branches. The hypoglossal nerve is now massively infiltrated, the nerve is distended. Macroscopically clear infiltration. Separation of the nerve. Further dissection along the internal carotid artery. Here the tumor can be laboriously dissected from the internal carotid artery, as well as from the vagus nerve. Inclusion of the stylohyoid muscle. Cranial separation of the internal jugular vein. However, this is hardened from the wall near the base of the skull, here a marginal sample. Subsequently, further removal of the lymph nodes between the branches of the cervical plexus from level V a and b. Multiple lymph nodes are positive here. Branches of the cervical plexus can be partially preserved, the cranial accessorius nerve must also be severed and removed. Finally, the massive lymph node conglomerate and multiple affected lymph nodes can be removed. Level II to V removal. Soft tissue is removed cranially from the area of the internal carotid artery up to the bifurcation. This soft tissue is carcinoma-positive, as is the marginal sample of the internal jugular vein, which was removed close to the base of the skull. Thus an overall R1 to R2 situation. No further measures due to the involvement of vital structures. Snaring of the superior thyroid artery, the lingual artery and the internal carotid artery. Exposure of the pharyngeal wall. Tumor resection: Exposure of the upper edge of the tumor from the inside. Dissection through the pharyngeal wall under control from the inside and outside. Exposure of the tumor and successive removal of the tumor with a safety margin of 1 to 1.5 cm on all sides, also macroscopically towards the depth. Parts of the pharyngeal wall from the tonsillar lobe and parts of the glossoalveolar junction are removed. Parts of the vallecula are removed caudally, the base of the tongue is largely removed in the caudal and middle section, with the resection extending to just above or partly above the midline. The tumor is removed in its entirety and marked with sutures. As a hardened nodule was noticed cranially when the tumor was removed, which may also have corresponded to the tonsil, a marginal sample is taken from the pharyngeal wall area with remaining parts of the tonsil. In the frozen section, this tumor margin specimen as well as the specimen in the healthy state, relatively scarce in the basal region due to tissue shrinkage, but to be classified as R0 during resection. Neck dissection on the left side. For this purpose, an apron flap is created in the usual manner. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the digastric and omohyoid muscles. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the facial vein. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Clearing of the neck levels II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. Several rough, spherical lymph node metastases are clearly visible here, all of which are also removed. After the neck dissection on the left, the tracheotomy is performed. The incision is made at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage. Dissection down to the thyroid isthmus, which is cut through. Thorough bipolar coagulation. Opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis and reintubation. Elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap boundaries (size) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the pronator quadratus and flexor pollicis longus muscles with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vascular clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Deposition of the radialis graft and preparation of the vascular situation in the elbow. Lifting of split skin on the right thigh. Application of Starsil wound powder and application of a foam dressing. Preparation of the wound bed on the left forearm. For this purpose, the superficial ramus of the radial nerve is embedded laterally into the tissue so that it cannot come into contact with the split skin and is protected. Partial adaptation and reduction of the wound area and suturing of muscles to tendons that are particularly exposed. Fitting of the split-thickness skin graft and suturing of the split-thickness skin graft in the usual manner. At the end, the application of ball swabs to areas where the split skin had no contact with the subsurface. Application and suturing of compresses and application of a dorsal forearm splint. Insertion of the graft, initially transorally. Here the defect extends up to the soft palate and into the tonsillar lumen. The tonsil is also removed. The remaining graft must be sutured in from the transcervical side. Due to the ultimately even larger defect than planned, the pharynx must be partially gathered. However, this is not a problem, so that the graft fits well in the end. The stalk is transferred to the left side; there is no longer a connecting vessel on the right side due to the radical neck dissection. The superior thyroid artery is used on the left side. This is particularly difficult as all other vessels in the neck are very small in caliber, but the radial artery is very large. Therefore, the caliber jump must be specially bridged using suture techniques. The venous anastomosis is performed on the facial vein and the external jugular vein. The flap pedicle has very good pulsation at the end and the flap is well supplied with blood. Insertion of two Redon drains. Application of a pressure dressing on both sides. The patient goes to the intensive care unit intubated and ventilated through the tracheostoma with a size 8.0 tracheostomy tube. Final consultation with the anesthesia department. Please continue postoperative antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Flap checks according to the usual schedule.","Combined transoral-transcervical tumor resection, Radical bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Submucosally, the tumor reaches the uvula on palpation and thus the median line of the soft palate. However, it can be differentiated from the hard palate. Furthermore, the tumor extends over the lateral pharyngeal wall, the angle of the jaw, straight onto the base of the tongue and ends caudally just above the lateral wall of the piriform recess. The tumor is now cut around from the enoral side with the monopolar and the scissor blade with an appropriate safety distance of approx. 1 cm. After in toto resection, the specimen is thread-marked and sent for histopathological frozen section evaluation. This reveals an R1 situation caudally in the area of the glossotonsillar groove, so that a resection and a further final marginal sample are sent for frozen section diagnosis. This is now tumor-free. The neck is first dissected, initially on the right side: a skin incision is made along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Dissection of the platysma and creation of a cranial platysmal flap. The external jugular vein and the auricular nerve are spared. Dissection of the vascular nerve sheath while sparing the vascular nerve structures. Dissection along the omohyoid muscle to the hyoid bone and along the digastric muscle to the laterobase. All vascular nerve structures can be preserved on the right side and levels II, III, IV and Va are removed. A lateral pharyngotomy is then performed to insert the pedicle, taking the posterior digastric venter muscle with it to prevent narrowing of the pedicle. The facial vein and the lingual vein also cross the pedicle passage so that they are ligated and cut. A lumen 2 to 3 transverse fingers in size is now created to allow the stem to pass through easily and without pressure. This is followed by the neck dissection on the left side: for this purpose, a skin incision is also made along the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the case of two previous left cervical operations. Here, the vascular nerve sheath is dissected and the vascular nerve structures are preserved in difficult, scarred conditions. Dissection along the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid bone and along the digastric muscle up to the laterobasis. Completion and elevation of the level II and III neck block without conspicuous lymph node pathology macroscopically. Furthermore, clearing of level Va. Macroscopically, there are no abnormal lymph nodes on the left side. However, the assessment is limited due to the scarring situation in the case of previous surgery. Parallel to the neck dissection, elevation of the radialis graft from the left forearm in tourniquet (300 mm/Hg). After measuring the graft to be lifted and marking the intended structure of the defect coverage, the lift is performed in the typical manner using a skin monitor. Skin flaps are created and subfascial preparation is made on the brachioradialis muscle. The cephalic vein is included in the elevation in order to integrate the superficial venous system into the venous drainage. Dissection distally and after using the Hayden maneuver, identification of the radial superficial ramus nerve. Protection of the nerve. Locate the vascular pedicle, cut it and further dissect the ulna. Here, too, subfascial dissection with protection of a peritendineum. Lifting now from distal to proximal into the crook of the elbow. There is no transition from the deep to the superficial venous system in the sense of a venous bridge, so that a deep vein is provided in the antecubital fossa as a connecting vein after the venae comitantes have been brought together. The cephalic vein, on the other hand, is ligated accordingly. Separation of the radial artery above the interosseous artery. The ulnar artery is clearly identified beforehand. After initial vascularization due to cold in the area of the flap, with good blood supply to the forearm and hand, after opening the tourniquet, the blood supply to the graft is regular after appropriate warming. For this reason, the graft is not lifted for half an hour to allow it to recover. This takes place completely. After careful hemostasis of minor bleeding in the area of the graft, the graft is now set down accordingly and inserted from the outside to the inside into the enoral defect for reconstruction of the soft palate and the lateral pharyngeal wall. Parts of the tongue body are sutured primarily. Incorporation leads to a successful reconstruction of the structures to be treated, followed by microvascular anastomoses. For this purpose, the superior thyroid artery is anastomosed end-to-end with the flap artery using 8/0 nylon sutures. The vein is anastomized end-to-end using a 2.5 mm vascular coupler. If the vascular flow is regular and the flap is well perfused, a fat seal is inserted into the pedicle curvature in addition to the skin monitor for better pedicle positioning. Subcutaneous sutures and skin suture on the right cervical side with insertion of a flap. On the left cervical side, the skin suture is performed in the classic sense in the form of a subcutaneous and single-button skin suture and insertion of a Redon drain. Meanwhile, the forearm is partially closed primarily and covered in the area of the lifting defect with full-thickness skin from the right groin, which was previously removed, and covered with a vacuum dressing, which should remain in place for 7 days. Application of a Cramer splint. Repositioning of the hand and forearm. Finally, creation of a tracheostoma. For this, a typical jugular skin incision is made and, after subcutaneous preparation and lateral displacement of the infrahyoid muscles, the thyroid isthmus is cut. Dissection of the anterior surface of the trachea. Creation of a caudally pedicled stoma and suturing of the stoma edge to the skin. Transfer intubation to a blockable Lanz cannula and suture the cannula. The cannula must remain in place for 5 days and any bandages and pressure in the neck area should also be avoided. The vessels are monitored by vascular Doppler examination and inspection of the skin monitor every hour for the first 72 hours and every 4 hours for a further 48 hours. If problems arise, the surgeon can be informed by telephone at any time. The patient is intubated and ventilated overnight for monitoring in the intensive care unit.

The panendoscopy initially performed showed a clear support for a primary tumor. In addition to the extensive cervical lymph node metastasis, the PET-CT showed a primary, suspicious lesion in the left hypopharyngeal region, as well as an inflammatory process in the lung, but no evidence of distant metastases. Preoperatively, our pulmonology department was able to rule out active TB. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference and in a detailed discussion with the patient and relatives, the primary surgical treatment was decided. Depending on the local extent of the tumor, this may even include a laryngectomy as a last resort.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, a new pharyngo-laryngoscopy is performed to search for the primary ear again. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube under dental protection and inspection of the inconspicuous oral vestibule. Inspection of the oral cavity, which, including the floor of the mouth, tongue and soft palate, is free on inspection and palpation. Inconspicuous oropharynx on the right side. The entire hypopharynx up to the entrance to the esophagus is also clear, inconspicuous endolarynx. In the area of the left piriform sinus, an exophytic, papillomatous tumor is now visible, which grows like a lawn in the piriform sinus and almost completely fills the piriform sinus from the lateral wall to the medial side. The esophageal entrance is certainly free. It can be seen that the tumor extends laterally to the left arytenoid via the medial piriform sinus wall, as well as to the postcricoid region, but here it is superficial on all sides, with no evidence of deep infiltration. Multiple deep biopsies were taken to confirm the diagnosis. The frozen section diagnosis now shows an invasive squamous cell carcinoma matching the already confirmed lymph node metastasis. Overall, however, the flat tumor is cT3 due to its size of over 4 cm. After hemostasis using suprarenal intubation, a PEG tube was inserted. For this, insertion with the gastroscope. Under laryngoscopic control, easy advancement into the stomach. Now, with good diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. The esophagus is inconspicuous on reflection. The patient was then repositioned and prepared for neck dissection on the left. Here a barely displaceable mass approx. 7 x 5 cm is seen, which sonographically is also clearly at least adjacent to the carotid artery. Palpation revealed clear infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Make a curved skin incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, taking the scar of the trial excision with it. Spindle-shaped excision of the scar. By excising the scar, the tumorous mass can be accessed directly. This is clearly a soft tissue metastasis without only a capsular structure, therefore extensive excision of the scar. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and exposure of the digastric muscle. This can just be separated from the soft tissue metastasis. Gross infiltration of the surrounding tissue. Therefore caudal separation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, also safe infiltration of the accessorius nerve. Partial approach of the metastasis to the omohyoid muscle, which is also taken along. Detachment of the thyroid gland, which is not infiltrated. Now visualization of the internal jugular vein, which is thrombosed here and clearly infiltrated caudally. Caudal visualization of the internal jugular vein, also showing clear signs of thrombosis and a very slender vessel. Visualization of the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Separation of the internal jugular vein, caudal and cranial after ligation and repositioning. Exposure and release of the submandibular gland, which is exposed. Anterior exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, which is also free here, overall difficult preparation conditions. Difficult resection conditions due to the partly diffusely growing soft tissue metastasis. Now dissect the common carotid artery, which is free. Exposure of the bulb, exposure of the exit of the internal and external carotid artery. After the exit of the external carotid artery, infiltration of the superior thyroid artery is seen. Later there is also infiltration of the lingual artery. Further dissection and retrograde tracing of the hypoglossal nerve also revealed a clear infiltration of the hypoglossal nerve. This is therefore also resected. Cranially, the external carotid artery is also thickened, so that the external carotid artery is resected approx. 2 cm from the exit after puncture and multiple ligation if its exit is safely infiltrated. Now good isolation of the internal carotid artery, which can be easily released after careful dissection, no infiltration here, so that macroscopic in sano resection is performed after removal of the metastasis from level 5 with partial infiltration of the cervical plexus and the surrounding musculature. When the right side wall of the pharynx is removed, a spontaneous perforation occurs in the direction of the pharynx with direct contact to the primaries, so it can be assumed that the metastasis is growing per continuitatem. Finally, clearing of levels Va and Vb. Ligation of the caudal level Vb without evidence of lymph flow. The jugular vein had already been removed previously, but its drainage area was preserved. Now turn to tumor resection. First, after dissection of the paralaryngeal muscles, expose the thyroid cartilage horn, push off the perichondrium, remove the lateral thyroid cartilage, carefully detach the hypoharyngeal mucosa. Now enter above the spontaneous pharyngeal opening, widen the pharyngotomy. Now a good overview. As described above, the tumor appears like a turf and very superficial in the extensions. Macroscopically inconspicuous. Therefore, first resection of the macroscopically altered tissue. The resection extends over the entire piriform sinus up to the arytenoid as well as approx. 1/3 of the postcricoid region. Starting from the left arytenoid, it can be seen that a tumor turf also extends to the aryepiglottic fold and reaches up to the edge of the pharyngoepiglottic fold, completely detaching the altered area. Due to the already spontaneous perforation of the tumor, the tumor was resected in parts, certainly no deep infiltration. Completely covering the tumor, the removal of completely imaging margin samples is now carried out. In the area of the medial piriform sinus wall, there is still margin-forming CIS with otherwise in sano resection of the invasive carcinoma. Therefore, a resection is performed first and then a final margin sample is taken, which shows moderate dysplasia in the frozen section diagnosis without evidence of CIS or invasive carcinoma. Therefore, an R0 resection can be assumed here. This results in a defect that includes the entire piriform sinus, including the medial wall up to the postcricoid region. The endolarynx and the arytenoid joint itself were not altered. In addition, the left aryepiglottic fold was resected as well as the lateral edge of the epiglottis up to the vallecula. A total defect measuring approx. 10 x 5 cm is now measured, readaptation of previously released postcricoid mucosa. Due to the defect and the extensive cervical metastasis, there is now an indication for defect reconstruction. Therefore, the tracheotomy, right-sided neck dissection and ALT graft harvesting from the right thigh are now performed in parallel. First the tracheotomy. To do this, make a skin incision approx. 1 cm below the cricoid cartilage, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose and ligate both anterior jugular veins, expose the infrahyoid muscles, enter the linea alba. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Identification and clamping of the thyroid isthmus. Transection and puncture ligation. After exposing the anterior surface of the trachea, insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring: creation of a broad-based Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma. Subsequent intubation, initially onto a Woodbridge tube, later onto an 8 mm Rügheimer cannula, which is suture-fixed. Now for neck dissection of the right side of the neck. To do this, make a curved skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland, exposure of the accessorius nerve and free dissection of the internal jugular vein with careful protection and the strong anterior branches of the veins, which end in a type of facial venous plexus. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve, cervical artery and superior thyroid artery. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level 5 with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Subsequent vessel preparation. An antero-lateral transfemoral graft is then harvested from the right side; after marking the landmarks, two strong main perforators and a secondary perforator are identified by Doppler sonography. Removal of a 16 x 5 cm graft to obtain a skin monitor. Initial medial skin incision, cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose and secure the rectus femoris muscle. Strictly subfascial preparation, identification of the ramus descendens, the lateral circumflex artery. After visualization of the anatomy, it is now apparent that the ramus descendens provides an intramuscular perforator and the ramus obliquus a fasciocutaneous perforator. Careful dissection of both pedicle vessels. Despite dissection up to the groin, there is no common arterial confluence. Therefore, initially leave both vessel preparations and primarily the ramus descendens completely cut around the graft, distal ligation of the vascular pedicle. Inclusion of the fascia lata, caudal fasciocutaneous elevation of the graft in the area of the caudal perforator. Inclusion of a muscle cuff to protect the perforators. Cranial fasciocutaneous elevation again. A regular flap vitality can be seen on all sides. Now, with a long but slender vessel of the descending branch, the cranial perforator is clamped off, and even after waiting there is no change in perfusion and therefore restriction to the caudal main perforator. Dissection of the long artery and the vein after confluence and removal of the graft with normal vitality. Careful wound inspection and, if conditions are dry, insertion of a Redon drain and careful and strong two-layer wound closure. The graft is now inserted and a patch measuring approx. 10 x 5 cm is inserted into the pharyngeal defect. Overall good fit. Deepithelialization of the remaining graft, leaving an area of skin measuring approx. 3 x 3 cm in the tip of the flap. This is later sutured into the cervical skin for monitoring. After complete and sufficient suturing, there is now no possibility of left-sided anastomosis due to the narrow vessels, therefore prelaryngeal tunneling, creation of a wide tunnel of approx. 6 cm. After fixation of the fascia lata and the muscle cuff, the vessels are moved to the right side of the neck under tension-free conditions. Good positioning here. Conditioning of the flap vessels, conditioning of the superior thyroid artery, placement of the superior thyroid artery after clipping of the part. Good flow conditions here and subsequent performance of the vascular anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon, this succeeds without any problems despite a clear caliber advantage on the part of the superior thyroid artery, followed immediately by good venous return. Conditioning of an anterior internal jugular vein, measurement of a size 3.5 coupler, problem-free performance of the venous anastomosis with the coupler, immediate regular flow with good flap perfusion. Careful positioning of the stalk and, if flap vitality is normal, cervical insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure on the left side using the raised skin monitor. Final laryngoscopic check. The graft is intact with normal vitality as far as can be assessed here. Regular vitality in the area of the skin monitor and termination of the procedure at this point. Note: Due to an intraoperative drop in oxygen saturation, the recovery process was monitored in the operating theater. A detailed clinical, neurological diagnosis reveals an oriented and responsive patient with lateral motor function and reflexes as well as lateral pupils with regular light reflexes. Postoperative neurological monitoring of the patient and, if neurological deficits occur, neurological consultation with imaging. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT3 cN3 G3 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the left. The defect was reconstructed using an anterolateral transfemoral graft from the right with right cervical vascular anastomosis. Please monitor the flap via the sutured skin island and via enoral inspection with the patient awake. If possible, please leave the tracheal cannula in place for at least 5-7 days postoperatively due to the prelaryngeal vascular pedicle and leave the Redon drains in place for at least 3-4 days postoperatively. If flap vitality is normal, perform an X-ray pre-swallow on the 10th postoperative day. Due to the extent of the resection, a prolonged recovery of swallowing function can be expected.","Tumor resection, Radical neck dissection

Then, first of all, entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the hypopharynx and larynx area. The hypopharynx including the piriform sinus is unremarkable. The tumor is located on the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis, extends downwards at the edge of the right vallecula and merges with the aryepiglottic fold. However, the ary on the right is not affected by the tumor. The base of the tongue is also not affected by the tumor. Insertion of a spreading laryngoscope and preliminary shaping of the laser and with the microscope. Then demonstration of the findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and also briefly on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. It is recommended to divide the epiglottis and remove the tumor successively with the laser. The epiglottis is then also divided first. The tumor is surrounded by the laser along its borders with a safety margin of approx. 1 cm. The preparation is then marked with a thread for the frozen section. At two points where the tumor appeared very close to the healthy tissue macroscopically, marginal samples are taken. These margin samples are also tumor-free in the frozen section. Unfortunately, there are still tumor cells in the frozen section in the area of the transition from the vallecula to the pharyngeal side wall, so a large resection is taken there and then another marginal sample, the last marginal sample is then tumor-free. Due to the size of the defect, a tracheotomy is performed in the usual manner. This involves a skin incision, then dissection down to the musculature. Push the muscles aside, expose the thyroid gland, cut through the thyroid isthmus. Exposing the trachea and entering the trachea between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Omission of a Björk flap. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis and reintubation to an 8 mm tracheal cannula. Neck dissection on the left (<CLINICIAN_NAME>/<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Skin incision on the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Visualization of the submandibular gland, visualization of the posterior belly of the digaster muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, clearing of levels IIa, III and IV while preserving all structures. Then neck dissection on the right side (<CLINICIAN_NAME>/<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Similar procedure in principle, skin incision on the anterior border of the sternocleidomatoid muscle, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the posterior digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, free dissection of the internal jugular vein, exposure of the accessorius nerve. Evacuation of levels IIa, III, IV and Va while sparing the plexus branches. PEG insertion: very careful insertion with the flexible esophagoscope, as the patient has esophageal varices I°. This is also successful without any problems. The stomach shows a cobblestone-like relief in the sense of erosive gastritis. Diaphanoscopy is good and the PEG is inserted in the usual manner using the thread pull-through method. Please continue antibiotics for 3 days. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit, but may wake up. The PEG should not be loosened until the 3rd postoperative day. Wait for histology and presentation of the patient at the tumor conference.","Transoral laser resection, Functional neck dissection

Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the site. A flat exophytic mass is seen in the area of the vallecula with transition to the base of the tongue and the lingual surface of the epiglottis. Now insertion of the spreading laryngoscope and advance of the microscope including laser. Start with laser resection 4 watt continuous wave superpulse on the left side in the area of the base of the tongue. Then successive laser resection in the area of the base of the tongue down to the hyoid bone. Removal of the epiglottis in the lateral area on both sides. The epiglottis itself cannot be retained due to the tumor infiltration. The resection of the epiglottis was discussed in advance with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who also demonstrated the findings.

Positioning of the patient and insertion of the mouth guard. Approximation of the tongue. An exophytic mass on the edge of the tongue with a dorsal leuoplakia is revealed. This mass is first incised with the electric needle and the resection margins are determined. It can be seen that the mass is very superficial, so that the body of the tongue is only covered superficially. The resection depth reaches a maximum of around 1 cm. The resection is performed successively and extremely carefully with subtle hemostasis and ligation of some larger arterial vessels. If the wound is dry, representative samples are taken from the margins, all of which are found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. This therefore appears to be an R0 resection. The tumor specimen is sent for final histopathological assessment in thread-reinforced form. Infiltration of the tongue with a long-acting local anesthetic. The edge of the tongue is then closed with inverted sutures. After aspiration of blood residue, removal of the mouth block. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection on both sides.

Entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the tumor. The tumor is very difficult to locate. There is an exophytic mass in the area of the right vocal fold with transition into the anterior commissure and onto the left vocal fold. In the area of the right vocal fold, the mass extends to the vocal process and into the morgue sinus. On the left side, the mass extends to the posterior third of the vocal fold and also into the morgue sinus. The folds of the pocket are only partially affected, if at all, on the right side. Due to the poor adjustability, partial laryngectomy from the outside. Therefore sterile washing and draping. Zigzag skin incision. Exposure of the prelarygneal musculature. Push the prelaryngeal muscles to the side. Incision of the perichondrium on the thyroid cartilage. Pushing off the perichondrium. Incision of the thyroid cartilage in the median. The thyrohyoid membrane was previously split in the middle. Opening of the larynx and inspection of the tumor. The tumor is located as described above. First, the right side of the thyroid cartilage is removed. This is successful without any problems. Deposition of the vocal process with the Kittel scissors in the posterior region. Deposition of the tumor on the subglottic slope and in the area of the morgue sinus. On the anterior part, the tumor extends slightly into the pocket fold, so part of the pocket fold is removed here. Transition to the left side. Here the tumor is also pushed away from the thyroid cartilage and deposited in the posterior third of the vocal fold. Removal of the morgue sinus and placement of the tumor in the anterior commissure. This results in tearing of the tumor. There is no infiltration of the thyroid cartilage in any areas. The tumor ruptures in the anterior commissure and is thread-marked in two pieces for final histology. Samples are taken from all margins as well as from the depth. All marginal samples are in frozen section R0. Transition to reconstruction of the larynx. First, the mucosa of the pocket fold is sutured to the mucosa of the subglottic region on the left side. Insertion of two drill holes through the thyroid cartilage in the area of the anterior commissure. Here, the pocket fold in the left area is fixed forward so that ultimately no thyroid cartilage is exposed. The same procedure is performed on the right side. On the right side, however, a small section in the anterior region can no longer be closed. This means that the mucosa of the pocket fold cannot be connected to the subglottic region in this area, as too much mucosa has been resected here. However, it is possible to fix the pocket fold to the anterior commissure on the right side in order to leave all edges of the anterior commissure covered with mucosa to prevent synechiae from forming. Finally, drill holes in the posterior area and suture the thyroid cartilage. Suturing of the remaining soft tissues, perichondrium, muscle fascia, muscle and subcutaneous tissue in layers. A flap was previously inserted. Application of a pressure bandage. A tracheostomy was not performed intraoperatively if the wound conditions were good. The patient should be fed via the inserted nasogastric tube for at least five days. The patient should then be carefully fed and presented at the tumor conference.

Incision of the trachea below the third tracheal clasp and insertion of the tube after reintubation of the patient. Subsequent infiltration with local anesthetic containing adrenaline in the area of the subsequent apron flap incision. Sterile washing and draping. Sharp formation of the apron flap subplatysmal and elevation and fixation upwards in the usual manner to beyond the hyoid bone. Now start with the neck dissection on the right side. Mobilize the sternocleidomastoid muscle while protecting the medial and lateral parts of the accessorius nerve. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Opening of the vascular nerve sheath and skeletonization of the internal jugular vein and the carotid artery. Regions II to V are then removed, sparing all non-lymphatic structures. Subsequently, the superior thyroid artery is ligated,.............. Hypoglossus. Now detach the constrictor pharyngis muscle from the thyroid cartilage. Release the piriform sinus. Separation of the prelaryngeal and prethyroid muscles and lateral displacement of the right thyroid lobe. Subsequent transition to the opposite side. Similar procedure with the same findings. A suspicious lymph node metastasis is found macroscopically in the area of the facial angle, which is of course also removed. After appropriate mobilization of the larynx, an incision is made at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage. Dissection of a caudally pedicled mucosal flap, which is used to cover the tracheal chimney, in the usual way. Then dissect the larynx cranially. Enter the hypopharynx at the level of the arytenoid cartilage. Widen the incision to the right to ensure a good view of the tumor, which is mainly located on the left. The tumor is then released with a macroscopic safety margin of 0.5 to 1 cm. Cranially, parts of the vallecula and the base of the tongue are included in the resection. On subsequent inspection of the resected area, the impression is gained that the safety margin is somewhat smaller in the caudal resection area, both on the right and left. Therefore, resections are performed on both sides. The resulting mucosal defect is then circumcised and all specimens are sent for frozen section histological examination. These proved to be tumor-free. Only postcricoidal moderate dysplasia was found. Therefore, a resection and a further frozen section for normal histology are performed at this point. Subsequently, myotomy of the inferior constrictor muscle on the dorsal side of the hypopharynx. Insertion of a size 8 Provox Vega8 cannula. Completion of the tracheostoma by H-shaped incision of the third tracheal clasp and completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequent two-layer closure of the mucosal defect in a T-shape. The first layer contains an inverting continuous suture according to Conley. The second layer consists of the surrounding muscle tissue using a single button suture. Finally, three Redon drains are inserted on each side of the neck. Folding back the apron flap and two-layer wound closure with continuous skin suture by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Re-intubation of the patient onto a 10 mm tracheal cannula. Sterile wound dressing. End of the operation. Handover of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Total laryngectomy with selective neck dissection of regions II to V on both sides, for supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma. Primary voice rehabilitation by insertion of a size 8 Provox-Vega prosthesis and myotomy of the contrictor pharyngis muscle. Insertion of a tracheal chimney according to Herrmann. Please carry out a postoperative X-ray broad swallow on the 7th to 10th day. If a fistula is excluded, removal of the gastric tube and start of oral nutrition and phonation.

The panendoscopy performed at the same time showed no primary tumor. Likewise, no primary could be found in the PET-CT.","After induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues, tracheoscopy by the surgeon. The trachea is visible up to the bifurcation. Subsequent intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Repositioning for hypopharyngo-laryngoscopy. Entry with the Kleinsasser C-tube and inspection of the base of the tongue, epiglottic vallecula, right and left piriform sinus, postcricoidal region and esophageal entrance. No pathological changes here. Using the large double spoon, several samples are now taken from the base of the tongue on the right and left sides, which are sent for final histology. The endolarynx is then adjusted. No pathological changes here either. Repositioning for tonsillectomy on both sides. Insertion of the McIVOR oral spatula and palpation of the base of the tongue, floor of the mouth and the tonsils on both sides. No pathological resistance here. The tonsils are symmetrical on both sides and relatively atrophic. Start with tonsillectomy on the right side. Mucosal incision at the upper fold. Exposure of the tonsil capsule. Extension of the mucosal incision at the anterior posterior arch caudally and successive detachment of the tonsil from the capsule with the rasparatorium while sparing the anterior and posterior palatal arch. Separation of the tonsil at the caudal pole and bipolar coagulation of the caudal pole. There is no bleeding in the tonsil lobe on the right. Insertion of a hydrogen-soaked swab. Approach for tonsillectomy on the left side. Identical procedure here. No bleeding here either, after exposing the tonsil capsule and detaching the tonsil up to the caudal pole. Here, too, the palatal arch was spared anteriorly and posteriorly. Also bipolar coagulation at the caudal tonsil pole. Insertion of a hydrogen-soaked swab. Removal of the hydrogen-soaked swab. No evidence of further bleeding. Insertion of the velotraction and visualization of the nasopharynx. The posterior edge of the septum is clear, the tubal bulges are also unremarkable. No indication of a pathological change. Incision with Beckmann's ring knife and removal of minimal residual adenoids. Hemostasis using a hydrogen-soaked swab. No evidence of further bleeding after removal of the swab. Transfer for esophagoscopy and PEG placement. Entering with the esophagoscope under constant air insufflation into the stomach and distension of the stomach. There is a clear diaphanoscopy, despite obesity. Under the lower left paramedian rib, sterile draping. Injection of Ultracaine. Incision and puncture of the trocar without complications. Subsequent placement of the PEG using the thread pull-through method without problems. Repositioning for neck dissection on the left side. Injection of 6 ml ultracaine solution. Creation of an arched skin incision starting at the mastoid, pulling along the posterior sternal border in an anterior direction. This incision is chosen because the relatively large metastasis is located on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Sterile covering. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the platysma and creation of the platysmal flap. Locate the sternocleidomastoid and dissect the anterior edge of the muscle in depth. Successive detachment of the muscle. The auricularis magnus nerve is exposed in the anterior region. This is dissected and displaced caudally without severing it. The omohypoid muscle is then exposed and the retractor is inserted caudally. It can be seen that at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle from level II b to III, the metastasis is directly adjacent to the muscle without infiltrating it. Successive detachment of the metastasis in the cranial region from the muscle and search for the digastric muscle. Dissection of the digastric muscle and insertion of the cranial retractor. The accessorius nerve can then be exposed. This is spared until the end of the operation. Now dissect around the large cervical metastasis and detach the metastasis from level I after exposing the submandibular gland, which is pulled cranially with the Langebeck. Dissection around level II b up to level III. Now successive release of the metastasis, whereby a little thick secretion is emptied from the metastasis in the cranial region. Now visualization of the internal jugular vein and the facial vein. The internal jugular vein is displaced posteriorly/dorsally by the tumor, but can be spared. Dissection also reveals the cervical vein, which is traced in an anterior and caudal direction and is also spared until the end of the operation. Another small lymph node is found caudal to the mass, which is removed with the entire neck preparation. Subsequent dissection along the cervical vascular sheath and detachment of the fatty tissue from levels II and III up to level IV, with ligation in the caudal area to avoid a chyle fistula. No intraoperative evidence of chyle flow. Now turn to level II a. Here, the remaining fatty tissue cranial to the accessorius nerve is successively detached from the scalene muscles and then removed. Finally, the wound is irrigated with H2O2 and Ringer's and checked for hemostasis, which is present. Insertion of a Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure and completion of the procedure without complications. Conclusion: No evidence of primarius in the CUP panendoscopy. A TE/AT and trial biopsy from the base of the tongue on the right, left and median as well as a neck dissection on the left were performed.

During the tumor follow-up in the radiation clinic, a lymph node metastasis in the right angle of the jaw was noticed, so the patient was sent to us for further staging. We found a soft palate carcinoma on the right anterior palatal arch and a palpatory induration in the sense of a posterior right tongue margin carcinoma both clinically and subsequently in the panendoscopy. In addition, a sample was taken at 2 sites on the posterior wall of the oropharynx during the panendoscopy and carcinoma in situ was detected twice, once with transition to an invasive carcinoma. Therefore indication for the above procedure.","First, the patient is brought into the operating room and actively identified. Then induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Carry out the team time-out. The surgeon then positions the patient. Insertion of the Mc Ivor oral catheter. First assessment of the back surface of the oropharynx. Here, scarred conditions, partially whitish, non-wipeable mucosal changes starting paramedian on the left to almost the pharyngeal side wall on the right. In addition, an approx. 8 mm large carcinoma was found on the anterior palatal arch on the right side with a central ulcer, of which no histology was taken in the preliminary examination. This will now be completely resected. Subsequently, multiple marginal samples are taken and everything is sent for frozen section. Here the finding of a further carcinoma (the 3rd) is confirmed. Tumor-free in the frozen section. A defect of approx. 2 x 1 cm is created here. However, the posterior palatal arch is not affected. Now proceed to resection of the tongue margin carcinoma posteriorly on the right, extending to the base of the tongue. Insert the Jennings retractor for this. The tongue is then ligated and pulled out. The tumor is then palpated extensively and the borders marked with the bipolar. Gradually remove the tumor with a safety distance of 0.5 to 1 cm using the electric needle. Palpate again and again. At the end, the tumor can be completely removed. Bleeding is stopped bipolar. Now all-round and deep marginal samples. A frozen section shows that there is no tumor here either, and the Mc Ivor oral spatula is inserted again and the back surface of the oropharynx is inspected. Here, whitish mucosal conditions with scarring starting paramedian on the left and running obliquely downwards on the right. The electric needle is now passed around these, primarily creating a defect of approx. 2 x 1 cm. This is then dissected downwards on the muscle layer so that it remains intact. The prevertebral fascia is not exposed. The defect then becomes correspondingly larger due to the surface tension and reaches a size of approx. 3 x 2 cm. Between 12 and 4 o'clock, the mucosa continues to appear whitish and is therefore resected again. Due to the already large defect, no marginal samples are taken here, but the absence of tumor is determined on these 2 specimens after telephone consultation with the pathology department. Here, too, there is no tumor. Now a small mass approx. 2 x 1 mm at the cranial left tonsil pole above the tonsil is removed, also with a small safety margin. Primarily not suspicious. Final histology here. Subsequent transfer of the operation for neck dissection to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First marking of the skin incision after skin ablation cervical right. Sterile draping. Creation of an anteriorly curved skin incision. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure and ligation of the various branches of the external jugular vein. Sparing of the auricularis magnus nerve. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, digaster muscle and accessorius nerve. Sparing of the above structures. Dissection along the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial with exposure of the cervical vascular sheath along the entire length. In the area of region Ib and IIa, a highly suspicious mass was found, which was carefully dissected away from the internal jugular vein and removed in toto. Successive evacuation of the posterior and anterior neck specimen with removal of several conspicuous lymph nodes in regions III and IV. Repeated inspection. Dry conditions. Placement of a Redon drainage. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure bandage. Completion of the procedure without complications.","Resection of tongue margin carcinoma, Modified radical neck dissection

With CT evidence of infiltration of the entire right hemilarynx, the above-mentioned procedure is indicated.","Introductory consultation with the anesthesiologist. Repositioning of the patient and repeated endoscopic examination of the tumor region. The above-mentioned tumor extension is confirmed, so that the indication is confirmed. Subsequently, flexible esophagogastroscopy with PEG insertion with positive diaphanoscopy and positive tenting phenomenon using the thread pull-through method. This succeeds loco typico without any problems. Retraction of the esophagoscope and fixation of the PEG tube. Dressing is applied. Subsequent positioning of the patient and injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline in the area of the apron flap. Skin incision and dissection of the apron flap to expose the cervical vascular sheath and the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides. Then start with the neck dissection on the left side. No suspicious lymph nodes are found during the dissection. Neck dissection is carried out in the area of levels Ib, II, III, IV and partially V. During neck dissection, the cervical vascular sheath is exposed over a long distance. Long-distance dissection, displacement and re-embedding of the vagus nerve in the sense of neurolysis. Long-distance dissection, displacement and re-embedding of the accessory nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Same procedure in the area of the hypoglossal nerve. The entire neck preparation is sent for histopathological examination. Transition to the tumor side. Here, a lymph node conglomerate is seen in the area of the venous angle, which extends into the accessorius triangle. The number and size of the lymph nodes are also conspicuous down to level V. Here, too, the cervical vascular sheath is dissected over a long distance and the vagus nerve, accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve are exposed, relocated and re-embedded in the sense of a neurolysis. Complete evacuation of the hypoglossal triangle and the accessorius triangle as well as the lateral and medial neck preparation, resulting in a level Ib to V neck dissection. All branches of the internal jugular vein and the external carotid artery can be preserved on both sides during dissection. Exposure of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage. Here, the hyoid bone is released from the cranial side by separating the suprahyoid muscles. Subsequent release of the posterior horn of the thyroid cartilage on both sides. This also involves severing the vascular nerve bundle. Exposure of the lateral surface of the thyroid cartilage on the left side and release of the pharyngeal tube. Caudal dissection of the thyroid lobe. It is clear that the thyroid lobe is not covered by the tumor on either side, especially not on the right side. In this case, the thyroid gland has been removed, but a marginal sample was taken for frozen section diagnosis. This was found to be tumor-free during the operation. In addition, the thyroid isthmus is cut, which is cut off on both sides, thus exposing the anterior surface of the trachea. The trachea is opened between the 1st and 2nd cartilage clasps and a visor tracheotomy is prepared, through which the patient is cannulated after extubation. Opening of the pharynx at the level of the epiglottis and preparation of the pharyngeal tube. Care is taken to ensure that the largest possible width of pharynx is retained on the left side. Carefully detach the pharynx from the laryngeal skeleton. This provides a very good view and control of the tumor. The tumor is incised far into the healthy tissue. The tumor extension described above is again confirmed, so that the option of a partial laryngeal resection is now definitively ruled out. The dissection continues caudally by further detaching the pharynx. At the level of the cricoid cartilage, where there is certainly no more tumor infiltration, further detachment of the larynx and subsequent removal of the larynx directly below the cricoid cartilage. Subsequent subtle hemostasis. Taking marginal samples from the tumor specimen. Here, the medial margin sample is infiltrated in a frozen section as a carcinoma in situ. However, due to the fact that the mucosa appears completely free of irritation and there is only a narrow margin of pharyngeal mucosa in the area of the caudal tumor deposit, the decision is made not to take any further margin samples in this area in order to avoid the need for pharyngeal reconstruction using a free flap graft. After subtle hemostasis, insertion of a Provox prosthesis in loco typico. This is also successful without any problems. Pharyngeal closure after performing the myotomy, which is performed laterally on both sides. Subsequent pharyngeal closure with single button sutures and then two layers of continuous sutures. The pharynx is closed at the base of the tongue in a horizontal scar line and otherwise in a vertical line. Dissection of the infrahyoid musculature, which was displaced caudally together with the thyroid gland. This is now also sutured in front of the pharynx and fixed to the base of the tongue. Repeated bleeding control in the area of the neck dissection. Dry wound conditions here too. The apron flap is then folded back and the tracheostoma sutured in place. Closure of the skin incision on both sides with subcutaneous and skin sutures. Insertion of a tracheal cannula. Application of a pressure bandage on both sides. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Completion of the procedure. To splint the pharynx, the nasogastric tube inserted at the beginning of the operation by the anesthesia colleagues remains in place postoperatively. Nutrition should be provided via the PEG. The patient is admitted to the in-house intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Swallowing attempt on the 10th postoperative day.","Laryngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement

The above-mentioned operation was therefore indicated.,"Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Pharyngoscopy/laryngoscopy: The exophytic tumor is visible, which completely fills the piriform sinus, infiltrates the larynx over a wide area, occupies almost the entire postcricoid region, extends into the piriform apex and also extends into the piriform sinus lateral wall with small flat extensions. Indication for surgery thus confirmed. Repositioning of the patient, skin disinfection and sterile draping of all surgical areas. First start with neck dissection and pharyngectomy: injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine with adrenaline into both sides of the neck along the apron incision. Then first subplatysmal dissection of the apron flap in the typical manner up to the level of the hyoid bone or submandibular gland. Then start with the neck dissection on the right: dissection of the fat-lymph node preparation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of digastric muscle, omohyoid muscle and infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal/external carotid artery, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. Clearing of neck levels II to V while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Glandula submandibularis remains in situ. Subsequent neck dissection on the left side: Here the procedure is the same, but only removal of levels II to IV and small parts of V. Then laryngectomy: Exposure of the hyoid bone. This is separated from the suprahyoid musculature. Removal of the preglottic fatty tissue with dissection up to the entrance to the pharynx. Expose the superior chorda. Dissection of the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle. This is dissected to the right of the hyoid bone, but not resected further. The thyroid gland is dissected away caudolaterally on the right and the thyroid isthmus is separated after clamping and puncture ligation. Same procedure on the left. Dissection of the pharyngeal constrictor muscle and release of the piriform sinus. Also dissection of the thyroid gland caudolaterally. Then enter the epiglottis into the laryngeal or pharyngeal space. Exposure of the tumor. This is resected at a distance of 1 to 1.5 mm in the tumor border area, in the pharyngeal area. Microscopic inspection reveals extensions, the entire right pharyngeal wall falls just above the midline. On the left, the largest part of the pharynx can be preserved. In the area of the sinus tip, the defect is too large for a primary suture. The suture-marked preparation is sent to ....................... for frozen section histology. The tumor appears relatively close to the right side in the area of the transition from the postcricoid region to the laryngeal skeleton. Therefore, adjacent soft tissue in the form of fatty tissue, pharyngeal wall tissue and also thyroid tissue is resected from the upper pole and sent in as a right basal margin specimen. This was found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. Carcinoma in situ in the area of the entire right border. Also caudally at the transition to the esophagus. Therefore, a resection was performed using a mucosal strip several mm thick, certainly 5 to 7 mm thick, certainly 1 cm thick, from the area of the right pharyngeal wall down to the postcricoid area and the border to the pharyngeal area on the left. Then a marginal sample from the same area. This is now sent for frozen section histology. No more infiltrates here. Thus, apart from possible skip growth, the resection is R0. Myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle, pars fundiformis on the left side slightly dorsally. This widens the relatively narrow esophageal opening. After the resection, a radial flap is always indicated to cover the defect. Irrigation of the entire wound area with hydrogen and Ringer's solution and careful hemostasis. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Flap elevation of the radialis flap and coverage with split skin from the right thigh. After specifying a required graft of 11 x 9.5 cm by <CLINICIAN_NAME> with monitor island, the graft is first marked and aligned and then incised. Removal of the skin and preservation of the blood supply to the monitor. Due to the physiognomy of the patient, the width of the graft must be selected up to the extensor side. Subfascial release, careful radial exploration and preservation of the superficial ramus, radial nerve, but this must be neurolyzed over a long distance. This is ultimately successful. Maintenance of graft perfusion. Ulnar subfacial dissection, here careful dissection of the long superficial ulnar artery with clear kinking. Exposure of the radial artery. Clamping of the radial artery and later, after approx. 30 minutes without changing the good oxygen saturation of the hand, removal of the radial artery subfascially to develop the graft. Removal of the skin monitor while lifting a wide subfascial tissue anathema. Trace the graft or the vessels into the crook of the elbow, here the radial artery is isolated, the antosseous artery is relatively weak and is removed to obtain the pedicle length if the defect is extensive. There is a confluence of the superficial vein after elevation of the brachiocephalic vein with a wide bridge, which takes up the vein ............. of the radial artery and opens into a very strong cubital vein. In addition, 2 smaller venous outlets with drainage into the deep system are preserved. Careful hemostasis and, if the graft is vital on both sides, final placement of the graft after the supply and return vessels have been treated. The graft is then successively inserted into the pharyngeal defect using a special expansion suture in the area of the esophageal entrance. The operation is then handed over again. Incision of the radial flap: The flap measures 11 x 10 cm. It is sutured around the remaining remnants of the subtotally resected pharynx. This is done with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. In the area of the esophageal opening, incision and suturing of the triangular flap. Gastric tube already in place. A second row of sutures is made at the base of the tongue and on the sides. The infrahyoid musculature is sutured caudally over the flap connected to the esophagus, with the thyroid gland still lying over it. The flap is then connected to the vessels. The superior thyroid artery on the right is selected as well as a large outlet from the facial vein and a smaller outlet from a larger outgoing thyroid vein. After conditioning the vessels, suture the radial artery to the superior thyroid artery using 8-0 Vicryl single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. A larger outgoing vein from the facial vein is selected for the larger vein from the cephalic region. Anastomosis using a 4-0 coupler after measuring. After opening the clamps, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. An outlet from the area of the deep venous system is connected to a small outlet from an outgoing thyroid vein, after measuring the width using a 2-0 coupler. Again, good venous return after opening the clamps. Positive smear phenomenon. Finally, careful hemostasis again. Any open veins, venous or arterial vessels are clipped or ligated. The skin monitor was sutured into the skin via a small median cranial incision, tension-free. Subsequent careful irrigation and hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of 2 Penrose drains on the right and one Redon drain on the left and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Subsequently insertion of a 10 tracheal cannula, which is fixed with sutures. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is admitted to the interdisciplinary intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Flap control according to scheme by means of skin monitor control and Doppler sonography. Antibiotics continued for one week with Unacid. Feeding via the PEG tube for 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Overall cT4a hypopharyngeal carcinoma with infiltration of the larynx. Postoperative RT or RCT according to lymph node status.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Injection of local anesthetic with the addition of suprarenin in the neck and sterile abjoration. First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: the exophytic tumor is seen, which starts below the tonsil lobe or former tonsil lobe and extends towards the posterior wall of the oropharynx, the lateral wall of the oropharynx, the base of the tongue and also down towards the hypopharynx. Clear indication for surgical resection with subsequent flap coverage using a microvascular graft. Now start with the tracheostoma placement. Skin incision over approx. 4 1/2 cm below the cricoid cartilage, dissection through the platysma, search for the pretracheal muscles and insertion in the median line. Push the muscles laterally. The cricoid cartilage and the trachea can be easily palpated. Now locate the upper pole of the thyroid gland and expose it. Successive transection of the thyroid gland from cranial to caudal using a bipolar and scissors. The thyroid lobes are bluntly pushed off, the trachea is now exposed. The incision is now made between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp and a Björk flap is created while protecting the tube cuff. Suturing of the Björk flap and reintubation. Subsequent skin disinfection and sterile draping of all relevant surgical areas, including the pectoralis major areas. First start with neck revision on the left: Opening of the old scar. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The V. jugularis externa is preserved and ligated as well as beaten caudally. Subsequent laborious dissection of the cervical vascular sheath through the scarring. The internal jugular vein can be visualized, but without any branches. Some ligatures can be visualized. The internal and external carotid arteries are then visualized. The hypoglossal artery is completely connected to the carotid artery or the bifurcation and can only be mobilized with difficulty. The facial artery and the lingual artery can be preserved from the external carotid artery and can be beaten laterally after clipping. Successive isolation of the pharyngeal tube from caudal to cranial, dissection of the large cervical vessels cranially. The styloid process is also resected cranially. During dissection, the digastric muscle is also severed and the submandibular gland is removed in the typical manner, exposing the lingual nerve and sparing the branch of the mouth, which can be exposed over a short distance. Lymph nodes are removed cranially at the parotid gland and also around the submandibular gland as well as latrally in the area of level V and laterally IV, III and II. Some lymph nodes were also removed anteriorly. Finally, complete isolation of the pharyngeal tube from the large vessels. Hypoglossal nerve preserved. Subsequently, after insertion of mouth blockers, combined removal of the tumor from the inside and outside. Tumor is removed macroscopically with a safety margin of 1.5 cm, in some cases also 1 cm. The entire side wall of the oropharynx and most of the posterior wall is removed up to the beginning of the posterior wall of the hypopharynx, which is also partially removed. At the top, lateral resection of the mucosa up to the bone at the alveolar ridge, lateral part of the tongue body or base of the tongue is also resected, including the parts of the extrinsic musculature. This is then beaten outwards and released from the piriform sinus with a wide safety margin. In the area of the larynx, it can be seen that the tumor has grown up to the edge of the vallecula or the epiglottis and has also grown up to the thyroid cartilage. Therefore, resection of the base of the tongue and vallecula, including lateral parts of the epiglottis and lateral parts of the thyroid cartilage as well as the largest parts of the arytenoid fold. Resection extends to the middle level of the piriform sinus or just to the tip of the sinus. Marginal samples are also taken from the alveolar ridge and the base of the tongue, including the epiglottis and vallecula. In addition, marginal samples from the arytenoid region up to the piriform sinus and marginal samples from the adjacent arytenoid region up to the supraglottic region are taken. The tumor is thread-marked and sent for frozen section like all other marginal samples. In the area of the aryepiglottic fold and in the area of the arytenoid region to the subglottic region still partly carcinoma in situ. Maximum moderate dysplasia in the remaining area. Due to the advanced resection in the area of the larynx, a final, approx. 0.5 to 1 cm wide mucosal resection from the arytenoid region to the piriform sinus, whereby the postcricoid region is already resected. Another 0.5 to 1 cm wide resection from the supraglottic region including the arytenoid region. The arytenoid cartilage is now exposed, as is the aryepiglottic fold lateral to the larynx or supraglottic region. Both specimens are also marked remote from the tumor and sent for final evaluation. Further resections are no longer performed due to the significant threat of inability to swallow. Subsequent irrigation of the wound area and hemostasis. Now proceed to neck dissection on the right side. Here, skin incision exactly in the pre-existing scar from the mastoid to caudal towards the jugulum. Then cut through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Then skin platysmal flap formation in the cranial anterior and caudal lateral direction, including the platysma. Subsequent exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Massively scarred conditions. It can now be seen that the common carotid artery with the bifurcation lies directly on the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is now dissected. The area of the bifurcation is heavily scarred. The internal jugular vein is no longer present in the case of previous surgery. Dissection along the weakly atrophied omohyoid muscle antero-cranially to the hyoid bone. Subsequent exposure of the posterior digaster venter muscle. Subsequently, sparse fatty tissue with hardly any lymph nodes is removed. The external jugular vein is also no longer present. However, 2 stronger veins can be found and dissected in the anterior triangle of the neck. The superior thyroid artery is also dissected 3 cm long after its exit from the external carotid artery. Further vascular dissection is then performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequent removal of the forearm flap: The size of the flap was measured beforehand. It is 11 x 8 cm and is planned three-dimensionally according to the requirements. Marking of the flap on the forearm. Curved skin incision up to the crook of the elbow. First cut the flap ulnarly. Lift the flap subfascially here. Ensure that some tissue remains on all tendons. Dissect cranially. Expose the superficial venous system, which shows a beautiful superficial vein with 2 ends in the area of the elbow. Connection to the deep venous system somewhat sparse but present. Then cut around the flap radially subfascially. Here, too, care is taken to ensure that tissue remains on the fascia. Distally, after clamping the radial artery and sufficiently long saturation over 98 to 100 %, the radial artery is removed and ligated with 4-0 prolene sutures as a through-layer ligature. The flap is then lifted along the pedicle. Small branches are clipped and bipolar coagulated. Successive tracing of the flap up to the olecranon. Here, transection of the interosseous artery after previous clamping with stable saturation. Then expose the confluence and radial artery. The vein is then removed and ligated. The artery is removed and closed with 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Flush the flap with heparin. The flap is then sutured into the defect. This is done without tension and completely except for a small remnant at the front of the tongue body. Adapting sutures are placed in the tongue body. An incision is made in the area of the larynx along the thyroid cartilage, an incision on the mucous membrane is not possible, as due to the................................. postcricoid mucosa, there is a risk of stenosis. Insertion sometimes with poor visibility and sometimes quite difficult. The stalk is now assessed with regard to connectivity. Conditioning of the radial artery and the two veins, whereby one of the cephalic veins, which is selected for the anastomosis, shows significantly thickened walls, even beyond the valve, and must be shortened. Subsequently, split skin is removed from the thigh with the dermatome, thickness approx. 0.8 mm. Starch is also applied to the wound area in the thigh and then a semi-permeable dressing is applied. Split skin is applied to the forearm without tension. Relief incision. A few swabs are sewn on to facilitate adhesion. Followed by Mepilex dressing. Wrapping with absorbent cotton and the application of some compresses. Then fitting of a Kramer splint and wrapping with an elastic bandage in a functional position. Positioning of the arm. Subsequent vascular suture. This is followed by anastomosis with the lingual and radial arteries. Suture with 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. Subsequent opening of the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. One of the cephalic veins is conditioned again for the venous anastomosis. In addition, the external jugular vein, which can be extended slightly by palpation. Here anastomosis with coupler 2.5. After opening the clamps good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The 2nd of the cephalic veins is connected to a vein from the opposite side, which can be dissected from the submandibular gland in the sense of a facial vein and can be removed. After slight mobilization, this vein can be transferred to the left side through a tunnel that has been created and anastomosed with the second cephalic vein after appropriate conditioning using a 2.5 mm coupler. Here too, after opening the clamps, the smear phenomenon was positive. However, the pressure in the vein was slightly higher due to the lack of internal jugular vein on the right. Overall, difficult conditions as far as vessel preparation is concerned. Subsequently, the flap is well perfused. Extensive hemostasis and irrigation follows. Hemostasis of diffuse bleeding, especially on the left, is considerably more difficult and prolonged. Finally, the small diffuse bleedings were largely stopped and closed by inserting a Redon drainage and 2 flaps on the left. The forearm was primarily closed in the cranial area. Finally, insertion of a size 8 tracheostomy tube, which is fixed in the typical manner with sutures. Further inspection of the flap, which is well perfused. The procedure is completed without complications. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics for a total of 1 week. Nutrition via the PEG tube. After 12-14 days, gruel swallowing and, if necessary, diet build-up. A prolonged swallowing disorder is to be expected, in this case it is essential to plan a visit to the voice and speech department. Flap control clinically and by Doppler sonography typically for 5 days. Anticoagulation should be suspended until coagulation control, then restarted if necessary due to the diffuse bleeding tendency. Presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference is essential because the R situation is still uncertain; if there is still in situ carcinoma in the left laryngeal region, boost radiation should be discussed if necessary.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheostomy creation, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

This reveals an exophytic tumor that infiltrates parauvularly from the anterior palatal arch into the tonsil, where it reaches close to the last molar and from there merges into the glossoalveolar groove. From there it infiltrates further into the base of the tongue and the upper edge of the hypopharynx. In the CT scan, it does not appear to be a strong tumor extension towards the vascular sheath, but rather a largely superficial growth. After extensive inspection, the possibility of resection using TORS is confirmed with overall good adjustability and good mouth opening of the patient. Insertion of the mouth retractor and good exposure of the tumor. After docking the patient cart of the robot, insertion of the instruments. Maryland forceps are used on the left and a monopolar spatula with a diameter of 8 mm is used on the right. First mark the resection margins using the monopolar spatula. The incision begins parauvularly. The resection is performed successively with a safety margin of about 5-10 mm in the extension described above. Part of the posterior palatal arch can be preserved so that the patient can swallow without regurgitation. The resectate can be removed en bloc together with the part of the base of the tongue and the orohypoharyngeal junction. The resection is carried out laterally into the parapharyngeal fatty tissue. The vessels of the cervical vascular sheath remain well covered by tissue. Overall, no major bleeding during the entire course of the operation. After the tumor is removed en bloc, first meticulous hemostasis. Careful inspection of the specimen. The tumor appears macroscopically distant from the healthy tissue. Therefore, marginal samples are now taken from the tumor specimen. These are sent in for frozen section diagnostics and assessed intraoperatively as tumor-free by the pathologist. This therefore appears to be an R0 resection of the specimen. The tumor specimen is thread-marked for final histopathological evaluation. Another intensive intraoperative check of the findings. Due to the exposed parapharyngeal fatty tissue, it is decided to perform the neck dissection on both sides in order to prevent fistula formation. Due to the fact that the patient was very easy to intubate and there was no serious bleeding during the entire course of the operation, it was decided not to perform a tracheostomy on the patient for the time being. Instead, the patient should be monitored in the intensive care unit for at least 3-4 days postoperatively. Subsequently, planning of neck dissection on both sides and, if necessary, adjuvant therapy in the tumor conference.","TORS procedure

Inconspicuous mucosal conditions in the area of the trachea up to the carina. The surgeon then performs transnasal and tracheal intubation and positioning of the patient without any problems. Perform a laryngo- and pharyngoscopy using a Kleinsasser tube. The glottis, the supraglottis, the posterior hypopharyngeal wall, the postcricoid region and the piriform sinuses on both sides were unremarkable. The posterior wall of the oropharynx and the right lateral wall were unremarkable. In the area of the left tonsillar lobe, there was an approx. 3 x 2 cm large contact volnerable mass covered with uneven mucosa, occupying the entire tonsillar lobe and a part of the posterior palatine arch, the anterior palatine arch and the palate ....Somit insertion of the oral cavity with the tonsillar retractor. Make an incision cranial to the mass close to the uvula and carefully cut around the mass to perform a transoral tumor tonsillectomy. Targeted, careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Removal of the specimen in toto, which is sent in thread-marked for final histology (short short cranial uvula, short long wound base middle third, long long tongue base caudal), macroscopic clear impression of a complete resection. Three marginal samples were taken (cranial uvula, middle third of the wound bed, caudal towards the base of the tongue), which were sent for intraoperative frozen section examination and found to be free of tumor and dysplasia. This results in an R0 situation (in the frozen section). Repeated inspection and hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Relaxation of the retractor. Re-inspection of the tonsil lobe on the left side and completion of the tumor tonsillectomy under dry conditions. Subsequent skin spray disinfection on both sides of the neck. Infiltration anesthesia, abjoration of the skin and sterile draping. Start neck dissection on the right side.

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment was recommended. Even with promptly planned surgical treatment, a cN3 neck status with an indistinguishable internal carotid artery was found preoperatively, but CT showed intact conditions here. No evidence of distant metastasis.","After preparation and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, a pharyngoscopy was performed and the extent of the tumor was checked again. An exophytic tumor was found in the area of the uvula with markedly uneven mucosal extensions towards the soft palate and the tonsillar lobes on both sides. Overall, however, the tumor is somewhat left-sided. The tonsils themselves are inconspicuous and free, no significant deep growth. Submucosal growth was ruled out, so that the tumor was initially resected en bloc with a safety margin of a good 1.5 cm. After safe complete resection, the tumor is resected with tonsillectomy on both sides. Left Performing a tumor tonsillectomy with removal of the anterior palatal arch on the right side. Classic tonsillectomy using the dissection technique, providing a good overview of the posterior palatal arch and the posterior surface of the soft palate. Resection macroscopically far in sano with subtotal removal of the soft palate, the tumor is also completely resected in sano on the specimen. Now removal of completely covering margin samples. The invasive carcinoma is resected in sano, but in the area of the posterior surface of the soft palate, with a macroscopic safety margin of approx. 2 cm, there is discontinuous Cis at the edge of the deposit, so a complete resection is performed here as well as the removal of an additional covering margin sample, which shows no higher-grade dysplasia or Cis, so that the final situation is R0. After measuring the defect, the patient is turned to PEG placement. The gastroscope is inserted under laryngoscopic control into the stomach without any problems, here with excellent diaphanoscopy, the stomach is punctured without any problems and the PEG tube is inserted using the usual thread pull-through method. The patient is then repositioned. Injection of xylocaine with adrenaline in the neck area. Initially, due to the extensive soft tissue infiltration and infiltration of the internal jugular vein on the left, turn to neck dissection on the right to secure the vascular status. Curved skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection and preservation of the strong facial vein, the extremely slender superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve with cervical anus. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Subsequent evacuation of level Va with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches, here macroscopically no suspicious nodules overall so that after wound irrigation the procedure is moved to the opposite side. Here, with infiltration of the directly subcutaneously located metastasis of the caudal parotid gland, the incision is curved around the lobule in the direction of the mastoid and then diverted cervically. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, preserving the platysma caudally. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Anterior exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle, which is clearly infiltrated in the area of the posterior venter. Release of the lobule, dissection down to the mastoid, the mass infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle over a wide area directly into the subcutaneous level, here infraauricularly thin conditions, so that cloudy secretion is discharged at points when attempting to dissect the skin, therefore leaving the entire skin area, here above the metastasis en bloc resection, here of a spindle of 2 x 2.5 cm and thus complete coverage, otherwise no skin infiltration. Dissection of the soft tissue mantle. After visualization of the cervical vascular sheath caudally and safe infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein, the muscle and vein were removed. Careful protection of the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Cranial dissection first of level V. Numerous nodules here, additionally here also circumscribed black pigmented changes, corresponding to the aspect of melanin changes, complete removal. Caudal preservation of the cervical plexus. Complete cranial resection. Here, the mass is broadly overlying and infiltrating the paravertebral musculature. Extremely aggressive perinodal growth. Complete resection of the paravertebral musculature. Exposure of the carotid bulb and the hypoglossal nerve, which can be preserved. Clearly no infiltration. Infiltration of the branches of the external carotid artery, here the occipital artery, the facial artery. Separation of the vessels, otherwise no carotid infiltration. Cranial complete rupture of the jugular-facial angle, the vein can only be deposited in a healthy state just below the base of the skull, here treatment with ligature and puncture. Infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle as far as the mastoid, therefore the periosteum is completely taken away. Bone infiltration. Infiltration of the caudal parotid gland, here showing the marginal mandibular nerve, which can just be detached from the mass without infiltration drawings. Otherwise no growth towards the facial nerve trunk. Mobilization of the non-infiltrated submandibular gland and complete evacuation of level Ib while leaving the gland intact and removal of the metastasis en bloc in toto with macroscopic in sano resection. Subsequently, careful treatment of the detached vessels, wound irrigation with H202 and Ringer's solution and insertion of two 10-gauge Redon drains as well as careful two-layer wound closure and circumscribed execution of relief incisions to close the current defect. The radialis graft is then removed from the left forearm. Marking of the graft, measuring a total of 11.5 x 5.5 cm with a special configuration for the soft palate and tonsil lobe. Creation of the tourniquet. Cutting around the graft. Widening of the skin incision towards the crook of the elbow. Initial radial dissection. Exposure of the cephalic vein, which is taken along the lateral edge of the graft. Identification and careful protection of the radial superfacial nerve ramus. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle, ligation of the distal vascular pedicle. Free preparation of the brachioradialis muscle, followed by ulnar preparation. Exposure of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. Strictly subfacial release of the graft, proximal pedicle preparation including the cephalic vein. Exposure of a strong venous vascular bridge between the deep venous system and the strong cephalic vein. Exposure of the radial artery after securing the outlet of the ulnar artery. Subsequent reopening of the blood vessel with vital margins and vital graft. Careful hemostasis and removal of the graft. After careful hemostasis, the wound is closed in two layers and the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the right groin is implanted. The vacuum pump is then applied and the Cramer splint is placed in the functional site. Full-thickness skin harvesting from the right groin: For this purpose, incision of an area measuring approx. 12 x 5 cm, strictly cutaneous elevation. Subcutaneous mobilization, careful hemostasis and, after insertion of a 10 mm Redon drainage, careful multi-layer wound closure under moderate tension. The graft is then implanted after the right-sided pharyngotomy has been performed. This involved resection of the posterior digastric muscle. The pharyngotomy is performed transorally and transcervically. Widening of the pharyngotomy with as little muscle resection as possible. Creation of a 2.15 finger-wide tunnel. Insertion of the graft, successive suturing. This succeeds well and adequately with a good fit and complete coverage of the pharyngotomy. The graft vessels are then conditioned. The arterial vessels are then explored. Here, the arterial vessels on the right side are extremely narrow and calibrated. Proximal preparation of the facial artery, here somewhat stronger conditions. Due to the position, the arterial anastomosis is now performed with 8.0 Ethilon under significantly more difficult suturing conditions. Overall laborious adaptation, but finally sufficient anastomosis with immediate venous return. Conditioning of the facial vein and implementation of the venous anastomosis using the coupler system with a coupler size 4.0. Subsequent regular pedicle pulsation. Positive spreading phenomenon and vital graft enorally, so that after final wound inspection on the right cervical side, a 10-gauge Redon drain was inserted, followed by careful two-layer wound closure and completion of the procedure with a vital graft without any indication of complications. Note: The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g, which should be continued for 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT2 cN3 left-sided uvular carcinoma, extended radical neck dissection with subtotal removal of the cervical plexus and paravertebral musculature. Postoperative careful flap monitoring with vital conditions and regular enoral healing, gradual food intake can be started from the 7th postoperative day. A tracheotomy was deliberately avoided in the case of completely thin enoral conditions and no exposed wound surface. If the wound heals properly, prompt presentation for planning the absolutely necessary adjuvant therapy in the case of extremely aggressive and rapidly progressive cervical metastasis.","Tumor resection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Bilateral neck dissection, PEG placement

After skin disinfection, subcutaneous infiltration with local anesthetic containing adrenaline in the area of the subsequent skin incision. Sterile washing and draping. Then initially perform the tracheostomy at the usual location. After skin incision, expose and undermine the thyroid isthmus. Open the trachea between the 3rd/4th tracheal clasp and insert the tube. Then complete the mucocutaneous anastomosis caudally. Then cut around the apron flap, which is successively folded up to the chin and fixed there. Then expose the prelaryngeal and prethyroid muscles, which are placed on the hyoid bone and folded caudally. Mobilize the hyoid bone also cranially, protecting the hypoglossal nerve and the lingual artery on both sides. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage and the thyrohyoid membrane. Exposure of the two lateral horns of the hyoid bone. Then open the hypopharynx at the left lateral hyoid horn. Then look at the right epiglottis margin, which is not infiltrated by the tumor. However, the tumor reaches about half of the epiglottis so that this is also resected. The tumor is then successively removed under vision using the monopolar knife with an appropriate safety margin. The resection encompasses the entire cranial vallecula. The base of the tongue is not affected. Caudally, the incision is made through the petiolus of the epiglottis without resection of parts of the thyroid cartilage. Ultimately, the tumor can be removed in its entirety in this way. Removal of marginal incisions circularly from the resection area, all of which prove to be tumor-free in the frozen section histological diagnosis. Subsequent transition to neck dissection on the left side. Here, a large metastasis is found in the area of region II, which infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle and also affects the caudal part of the parotid gland. This is first dissected from medial to lateral. In this way, the internal jugular vein can be safely protected and extracted. After securing the vascular nerve sheath, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is removed caudally and the mass is dissected cranially with resection of the accessorius nerve, which is completely surrounded by tumor masses, and removed in toto with resection of the caudal parotid pole. Neck dissection is then performed in region I with removal of the submandibular gland and regions IV and V. Transition to neck dissection on the right side. Here, too, there are several metastatic nodes, but they are mobile and not infiltrating. This means that regions I-V are completely removed on this side while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. The operation is then transferred to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The larynx is now moved cranially with several strong sutures on the lower jaw and positioned in the safe swallowing position under the base of the tongue. The prelaryngeal musculature is raised, completely covering the retaining sutures medially and refixed to the base of the tongue, thus forming the inner lining of the swallowing passage. Insertion of a Redon suction drain on both sides. Fold back the apron flap. Completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis in the area of the tracheostoma and two-layer wound closure on both cervical sides. Sterile wound dressing. End of the operation, transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Resection of a vallecula carcinoma on the right side via an external pharyngotomy with resection of the entire vallecula including the epipglottis. Reconstruction of the swallowing pathway by thyropexy on the lower jaw.

Due to the size of the tumor and the patient's wishes, the above-mentioned procedure was indicated.","First, induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues and transnasal intubation. Entry with the flexible oesophagogastroscope and endoscopy into the stomach. No abnormalities here. With good diaphanoscopy, insertion of a PEG tube using the thread pull-through method. This is successful without any problems. Insertion of a covered retractor, looping of the tongue and inspection of the carcinoma. The tongue tumor occupies 2/3 of the tongue on the right side, infiltrates the entire tip of the tongue and crosses the midline. First start with tumor resection using the monopolar needle and alternate dissection with scissors and bipolar forceps. The tumor is cut around successively. In the central area, the resection appears very close macroscopically. A thick slice is immediately resected and sent for final histology. Marginal samples are then taken and sent for frozen section. All marginal samples are tumor-free. Therefore intraoperative R0 situation. Due to the large remaining defect, which has also extended to the floor of the mouth, it is essential to cover the defect. This is done with a radialis graft. Then transition to neck dissection on the right side. Skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Release of the neck block II a to V a, sparing the plexus branches. The external and facial veins can be preserved. Level II contains several conspicuous, coarse nodes. Level II a to V a are removed while sparing the plexus branches and the accessorius nerve. Then neck dissection of the left side and tracheotomy (here follows dictation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>). Lifting of the radialis graft. First measure the size of the graft. This is measured at 16 x 8 cm. Then mark the graft in the area of the forearm. The forearm is small and very adipose. Cut around the skin. Then expose the cephalic vein and basilica in the area of the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the venous star with search for the confluence between the superficial and deep venous system. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle from proximal to distal. Exposure of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve, which has two branches, both of which are preserved. Exposure of the radial artery. Clamping of the radial artery under pulsoxymetric control. Ligation of the radial artery. Lifting of the radial artery graft from the tendons and development of the pedicle in the usual manner. Deposition of the stem while preserving the interosseous outlet. A superficial vein and a deep vein can also be lifted while preserving the confluence. Separation of the nerve and suturing of the graft into the defect area. This must largely be done transcervically, as the graft cannot be fitted transorally due to the adipose conditions. For this purpose, sutures are placed in the area of the vallecula and the graft is pulled in secondarily. In the area of the soft palate and the tip of the tongue, suturing is continued transorally. In some cases, the graft must be fixed around the teeth. Ultimately, the graft fits well. Then the anastomosis is applied. Suturing of the arterial anastomosis. This succeeds without any problems. Then anastomosis of the two veins. The facial vein and a branch from the facial vein are used here. This creates good pedicle pulsation, which results in good graft perfusion. Insertion of 2 Redon drains and two-layer wound closure on both sides of the neck. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Postoperative flap control according to the usual schedule.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy

The tumor is successively removed under vision with a safety margin of about 1 cm, ultimately resulting in a hemiglossectomy. Macroscopically and palpatorily, there are no more tumor extensions. When inspecting the specimen, the safety margin in the area of the anterior floor of the mouth is 1 to 3 mm smaller than in the other direction. Therefore, a resection is taken in the area of the anterior floor of the mouth. Subsequently, marginal sections are taken from the entire circumference as well as from the base of the tumor, all of which prove to be free of tumor except for the posterior tumor base. Therefore, in the course of the operation, a large piece of the tongue is resected again in the affected area and then another peripheral incision is taken. Both samples were found to be tumor-free on frozen section histology, so that an R0 resection can now be assumed. This results in an approx. 8 x 8.5 x 5.5 large area to be reconstructed. Subsequent transition to elevation of the radial flap graft from the left forearm. Mark the S-shaped skin incision and the radialis flap to be removed while protecting the retinaculum. Sharply cut through the skin and the subcutis. Push the two muscle bellies apart and expose the very strong vascular pedicle in depth. This is dissected proximally, where a strong cubital vein star is found. In addition, 2 large-lumen veins are dissected, which will later be used for anastomosis. Expose the origin of the radial artery. Then develop the flap distally. Here, after incision on the ulnar side, the flap is developed subfascially from here to the tendon. The radial side of the flap is then also developed, sparing the sensitive radial branch. The flap is now fully developed and is left in situ until both neck dissections have been completed. Once the tumor has been resected, the neck is dissected on the right side through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> simultaneously with the radial flap elevation on the left forearm. First, make an arcuate incision from the mastoid over the sternocleidomastoid muscle and curved anteriorly back towards the chin. Then dissection through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. The platysma is then further dissected upwards subplatysmally. The cervical anus is spared. However, this must be sacrificed later. Sparing of a vein running far anteriorly as a possible vascular connection later. Dissection of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the posterior digaster venter muscle. Then start with the lateral neck dissection. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and the accessorius nerve. At least 3 to 4 clear metastases can be seen. Removal of the upper neck specimen from level II b. Sparing of numerous accessorius branches. Dissection further caudally. Protection of the plexus branches. Then complete removal of the lateral neck preparation. Subsequent removal of the anterior neck preparation including level I a, i.e. subcutaneous tissue with lymph nodes up to the opposite left digaster venter anterior muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the vessels leading to the submandibular gland. Subsequent sharp exposure of nerve branches that run from the lingual nerve to the gland. Ligation of the Wharton's duct and complete removal of the gland. Then clearing of level II with at least one suspicious lymph node below the mandible. Subsequent preparation of possible connecting vessels for the radial artery flap, including the superior thyroid artery. Subsequently handover of the operation to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The undersigned <CLINICIAN_NAME> then also performs the neck dissection on the left side. Here too, lymph node regions I to V are successively removed. There are clinical signs of metastasis in almost all regions. The jugular vein is not thrombosed, but in the middle section in the region of region III it is somewhat weak in caliber, otherwise freely pervious. Dissection of the superior thyroid artery, which will later serve as an anastomosis. There is no facial vein as such, nor is there a large-volume inflow to the internal jugular vein, so that an end-to-side anastomosis will be performed for microvascular venous anastomosis. The radial artery flap graft is then harvested from the left forearm. This is pulled through the access created in the floor of the mouth to the left side of the neck and sutured into the area of the defect. The flap is then microvascularly anastomosed, whereby the radial artery is connected to the superior thyroid artery. The venous anastomosis was performed directly to the internal jugular vein in the end-to-side anastomosis. At the final check, the anastomoses are freely patency. In addition, the stalk is loosely fixed to the surrounding muscle tissue with 2 Vicryl sutures. Insertion of a Redon suction drain and a flap. Suturing of the two neck dissection incisions on the neck. Subsequent removal of an 8 x 5 cm split-thickness skin graft from the right thigh by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The defect in the area of the left forearm is treated with this split-thickness skin. Finally, perform the tracheotomy of the visor. After sharp transection of the cutis and the subcutaneous fatty tissue, the prelaryngeal musculature in the linea alba is pushed apart. After dissection, the thyroid isthmus is clamped off on the pretracheal lamina, cut off and pushed to the side. The trachea is then opened between the 3rd and 4th tracheal clasps. Completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis and easy insertion of an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube, onto which the patient is then intubated. Finally, the arm and thigh dressing is applied. Sterile wound dressing in the neck area. End of the operation and handover of the patient to anesthesia. Addendum: Macroscopically, there was evidence of clinical metastasis on both sides of the cervix, so that adjuvant radiochemotherapy will be indicated subsequently.","Glossectomy, Neck dissection, Tracheostomy, Flap

As far as can currently be ascertained, the patient underwent primary radiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma in 2012. After initially regular clinical monitoring, the indication for rapid panendoscopy was given in the case of an unclear change in the glottis with significant glottic stenosis.","After induction of anesthesia by anesthesia colleagues, together with anesthesia, laryngoscopy and attempt at tracheoscopy. The glottic plane itself is largely displaced with a well adjustable glottic plane, a complete passage with the tracheoscope is initially unsuccessful, but intubation is nevertheless problem-free. After positioning the patient, first turn to flexible esophagogastroscopy. To do this, enter with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Careful pre-scanning under constant air insufflation into the stomach - this is successful without any problems despite pre-therapy. The stomach itself is inconspicuous and clear. On reflection, the esophagus shows postradiogenic changes, in part somewhat vulnerable and especially in the distal part with typical postradiogenic telangiectasia, but without suspicious parts. As far as can be assessed, no evidence of recurrence of the previously known esophageal carcinoma. Now entering with the Kleinsasser tube under dental protection after inspection of the inconspicuous oral vestibule. The oral cavity, including the floor of the mouth, tongue and soft palate, is unremarkable. Also the oropharynx, with a slightly hyperplastic tongue base and folded vallecula, otherwise tumor-free. Inspection of the hypopharynx, which is unremarkable and clear up to the tips of the piriform sinus and the entrance to the esophagus, and the postcricoid region is also clear. On exposure of the glottic plane, an exophytic, largely ulcerated tumor can now be seen, which infiltrates the entire hemilarynx, extends extensively into the anterior commissure and largely displaces the glottic plane. As far as possible due to the tumor masses, adjustment of the subglottic level. Here, too, a subglottic growth of at least 1.5 cm can be seen, especially in the area of the anterior commissure, below which the mucosa appears to be free again, as far as can be assessed. The right pocket fold is edematous and submucosally indurated. Tumor growth is also present here. The right vocal cord level is also largely consumed by tumor. At the transition to both arytenoids, regular mucosa can be seen again, so that the tumor growth remains limited to the endolaryngeal area of the mucosa, however, transition to the subglottis. After demonstrating the findings and discussing the case with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the decision was made to debulk the tumor due to the extent of the tumor and the clinical condition in order to avoid a premature tracheostomy. Adjustment of the glottic plane with the small bore tube. Securing of the tube with compresses and subsequent tumor debulking with the CO2 laser with retraction of both vocal folds consumed by the tumor. Laser vaporization of the open tumour and laser vaporization of the adjacent mucosal oedema and creation of a wide glottic gap. Confirmation of subglottic expansion. Subsequently, with dry endolaryngeal conditions and wide glottic access, termination of the procedure at this point. Subsequent extubation of the patient without any problems. The samples were sent for urgent definitive histology. Conclusion: Overall, high-grade diagnosis of at least cT3 glottic carcinoma with extension to the subglottis. Postoperatively, please demonstrate the findings of the CT imaging to our colleagues in radiology - as far as can be assessed, there appears to be arrosion of the thyroid cartilage, but no breakthrough. Depending on the assessment by our radiology colleagues, repeat imaging if necessary. After receiving the definitive histology, please present the multimorbid patient to our interdisciplinary tumor conference. The tumor appears to be easily resectable via a laryngectomy - please complete the preliminary findings with evaluation of the radiation field. If the larynx was in the radiation field during the initial treatment, flap coverage is also indicated. Interdisciplinary case discussion, if necessary also with colleagues from internal medicine and anesthesia, alternatively primarily palliative supportive procedure.","Panendoscopy, Microlaryngoscopic tumor debulking (Laser)

The tumor extends from the tonsil lobe in a cone shape along the lateral pharyngeal wall caudally, passes over to the caudal base of the tongue and takes up about 1/4 of the tongue base growing superficially until it finally passes over to the dorsal floor of the mouth, glossotonsillar groove, mandibular angulus and the soft palate. Here the tumor extends to the parauvular region, where the resection is completed accordingly. The entire specimen is sent for frozen section assessment after marking the wound edges accordingly. Meanwhile, start the left neck dissection: To do this, make a skin incision along a cervical skin fold in the direction of the mastoid. Dissection of cranial and caudal platysmal flaps and exposure of the internal jugular vein and the auricular nerve. While the nerve can be spared, the vein ultimately lies across the situs so that it must be ligated as cranially as possible. Further dissection along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and exposure of the vascular nerve sheath. Dissection along the omohyoid muscle to the hyoid bone and along the digastric muscle to complete neck dissection level II to IV. Careful elevation of the neck block. A macroscopic metastasis is found in the area of level IIb. Here the accessory nerve passes through one of the two macroscopically conspicuous lymph nodes so that it must be resected. Otherwise, spare all vascular and nerve structures. Subsequently, careful evacuation of level V up to above the cervical plexus. Finally, lateral pharyngotomy after evacuation of level I, taking the submandibular gland with it. This was already visible enorally in the sense of the wound bed. As the frozen section diagnostics that had been performed in the meantime had described an R1 situation in the basal part, among others, this part was completely removed in the sense of a thorough resection. The facial and lingual arteries were ligated. The hypoglossal nerve, however, can be spared. Wide opening of the pharynx to the enoral defect. Neck dissection now follows on the right side by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and parallel to this the elevation of the forearm graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Transition to neck dissection on the right side. Mark the course of the mandible and the ascending mandibular branch as well as the mastoid. Create a curved skin incision extending laterally in the area of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sharp dissection of the subcutaneous fatty tissue and the platysma. Subsequent subplatysmal dissection. Subsequent exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and exposure of the omohyoid muscle as the caudal border. Subsequent dissection of the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid. Subsequent dissection and visualization of the posterior surface of the sternocleidomastoid and the course of the accessorius nerve. Then move on to exposing the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle as the cranial border. Also exposure and intraoperative protection of the hypoglossal nerve. Beginning of exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the internal jugular vein and the facial vein in its entire course up to the cranial border. The external jugular vein was cut off intraoperatively for reasons of clarity. The course of the common carotid artery was then exposed. After exposure of all the above-mentioned landmarks, the medial and lateral neck specimens are removed after successive dissection. On the right side, apart from the external jugular vein, all large branches of the external jugular vein and external carotid artery were preserved. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation and wound irrigation with Ringer's solution. Subsequent placement of a 10-gauge Redondra ring and two-layer wound closure. This results in a functional neck dissection on the right side in regions II, III and IV. The findings are then demonstrated <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Meanwhile, elevation of the forearm graft. For this purpose, draw the graft with a size of approx. 10 x 5 cm, taking into account the exact anatomy, so that the width is drawn variably. A skin monitor is integrated into the drawing for postoperative monitoring of the graft. Careful elevation of the graft, taking the cephalic vein with it. Separation of the radial vascular pedicle after appropriate preparation and elevation from distal to proximal into the crook of the elbow. Here the confluence of the superficial and deep venous system is sought out and identified as well as the outlet of the radial artery from the ulnar artery. Appropriate ligatures and removal of the vascular pedicle. Beforehand, the tourniquet (300 mmHg) is opened and careful hemostasis is performed. The lifted graft is now retracted from cervical to enoral and carefully incorporated using appropriate single-button Vicryl sutures (3.0). This results in complete coverage of the defect and satisfactory reconstruction of the oropharyngeal region. Parallel to the incorporation, full-thickness skin is lifted from the right groin and the lifting defect on the right forearm is treated with full-thickness skin and continuous suturing. Application of a vacuum dressing, which should be left in place for 7 days. Splinting of the arm with special attention to finger fixation. Meanwhile cervical vascular sutures. The superior thyroid artery is connected to the radial artery in the sense of an end-to-end anastomosis. The excellent flow of the superior thyroid artery is checked beforehand. After appropriate demonstration of good venous return, the flap vein is now connected to a branch of the facial vein using a size 2.5 coupler in the sense of an end-to-end anastomosis. To stabilize the curved course of the venous vessel and to prevent kinking, a small gelatin sponge is inserted into the curvature. The vascular monitor is now positioned correctly to stabilize the flap pedicle and incorporated into the neck skin. Subcutaneous sutures and skin suture. On the right side, insertion of a 10 mm Redon drain and also subcutaneous and skin sutures. Subsequent tracheostoma placement by <CLINICIAN_NAME> to temporarily secure the airway postoperatively. The stoma can be closed again once sufficient swallowing has been ensured and the swelling has subsided enorally with adequate breathing. The wound in the groin area is primarily treated with subcutaneous sutures and skin sutures. Insertion of an 8-gauge Duracuff cannula with core. This is sutured in place. The sutures should be removed after 5 days. Only then can the cannula be fixed in place with the appropriate tape. Classic monitoring of the transplant for 5 days, according to the applicable regulations and no bandages or tapes in the neck area for at least 5 days. The upper body should be elevated at approx. 45°.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheostomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Recommendation of primary surgical treatment in our interdisciplinary tumor conference. Immediate preoperative confirmation of the sonographic cN2a neck status with clinically prominent mass in level II on the right.","First inspection of the primary tumor region after intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Positioning of the patient. Entry with the tonsillar retractor. Inspection and palpation. The exophytic lesion can be seen in the area of the right tonsil lobe. On palpation, the lesion is submucosal and extending into the soft palate, with infiltration of the posterior palatal arch. Laterally, the mass is still displaceable. In this case, the tonsil capsule is barely exceeded. The tumor is now resected in the sense of a radical tonsillectomy. In the area of the submucosal part of the soft palate, the resection must be carried out as far as the parauvular area and a clear resection of the soft palate. The tumor itself is relatively well encapsulated, but takes up the entire tonsil lobe. Inclusion of the posterior palatal arch muscularly and in the area of the mucosal level. A muscle cuff is also left laterally and the lower tonsil pole is included. In this case, the tumor does not significantly protrude. On the specimen, the specimen is now resected in sano, but with encapsulation basally probably histologically barely in sano resection. Therefore, the tumor is completely covered basally and in the mucosal area by taking marginal samples. These are diagnosed as completely free of tumor and dysplasia in the frozen section diagnostics, so that a reliable R0 situation is present here. Due to the resection down to the soft tissues of the neck and the large area of exposed neck fatty tissue as well as the resection of almost half of the soft palate and resection of the posterior palatal arch, a radialis graft is indicated to cover the defect for the best possible functionality. The PEG tube is initially inserted if the neck status is positive. Insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-transmission into the stomach. If the mucosal conditions here are unremarkable and the diaphanoscopy is good, the stomach is punctured without any problems and the PEG tube is then inserted using the usual thread pull-through method. Neck dissection of the left side is then performed first. Submandibular incision. Separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma for complete exposure of the neck area. Perform a functional neck dissection level II to IV, exposing and protecting the submandibular gland, sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle, internal jugular vein, facial vein, cervical artery, superior thyroid artery, hypoglossal nerve and accessory nerve. Followed by careful wound inspection, wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Turning to the opposite side. Here in level II, a mass measuring approx. 4 cm. First cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma, which is not infiltrated. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. The mass is relatively smoothly encapsulated, no infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Free preparation of the anterior neck specimen, with careful protection of the hypoglossal nerve, superior thyroid artery and facial vein. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. The mass lies on the vein, compresses it, but does not infiltrate it. Similarly, exposure and preservation of the accessorius nerve, which is also only in contact with the mass. There is also no infiltration of the digastric muscle. Complete the neck in level V, carefully preserving the cervical plexus branches. Finally, resection of the digastric muscle and performance of a pharyngotomy and creation of a tunnel measuring approx. 3 transverse fingers enorally for compression-free style positioning. The radialis graft is now removed from the left forearm in a bloodless state. Draw a graft measuring 10 x 5 cm in total with a special soft palate configuration. Trimming of the graft. Radial dissection with the cephalic vein located far dorsally, leaving it intact. Exposure and preservation of the ramus superficialis nervi radialis. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Distal transection of the radial artery. Ulnar preparation. Strictly subfascial preparation and release of the specimen. Isolation on the vascular pedicle. Exposure and preservation of the common interosseous artery. Exposure and dissection of a venous confluence and removal of the excellent vital graft, after reopening of the tourniquet and regular hand perfusion. Subsequent careful wound inspection and hemostasis in the forearm area. Careful wound closure and incorporation of the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the right groin. Subsequent application of the vacuum pump. Application of the Kramer splint in the functional position and repositioning of the arm at the end of the procedure. For full-thickness skin harvesting from the right groin. Incision of a spindle-shaped area of skin measuring 12 x 5 cm in total. Strictly cutaneous lifting. Followed by subcutaneous mobilization. Hemostasis and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, multi-layer wound closure under moderate tension. The radialis graft is then incorporated. Despite the advanced swelling of the tongue, this was sufficient and regular. Good soft palate reconstruction and intact conditions on all sides. Stalk positioning and conditioning of the superior thyroid artery and performance of the arterial anastomosis with 8-0 Ethilon. Subsequently, immediate regular venous return and good graft perfusion. Conditioning of the facial vein and insertion of the venous anastomosis with the size 3.5 coupler, followed by careful irrigation of the wound if the graft circulation is normal and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Subsequently, due to the advanced swelling of the tongue and the extent of the graft, a protective tracheostomy is performed. This involves a circumscribed skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the infrahyoid musculature. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. In the case of protective tracheotomy, only punctual epithelialization. Subsequent problem-free reintubation to a size 8 low-cuff cannula, suture-fixed. The procedure was then completed without complications. Conclusion: Intraoperatively R0 resected cT2 cN2a tonsillar carcinoma on the right. Postoperative meticulous flap monitoring by enoral inspection. If the graft has healed properly, the patient can be gradually built up and decannulated from the 7th to 8th postoperative day. After receiving the definitive histology, presentation at our interdisciplinary tumor conference to determine the adjuvant therapy.","Resection, Neck dissection, Flap coverage (Radial), Tracheotomy, PEG placement

Patient now scheduled for resection of the tumor and neck dissection with clinical plus neck on the right.,"First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: After reclination of the head and insertion of the mouth guard, insertion of the small bore tube size C and B. The described tumor, previously described as cT1, is seen in the area of the glossoalveolar groove/base of tongue junction. Tumor is exulcerated. Further examination reveals an uneven mucosa in the area of the vallecula transition lingual epiglottis. A sample is taken here, which is sent for frozen section. The frozen section shows squamous cell carcinoma. Thus somewhat more extensive growth than known. Now adjustment of the tumor. Laser resection with 4 to 12 watts. Resection is now performed around the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1 cm on all sides. Resection proceeds from the lateral pharyngeal wall via the base of the tongue to the vallecula area to the left until microscopically healthy mucosa appears. Laterally, the resection goes into the pharyngeal muscle. Infiltrative growth is clearly visible here, so that the soft tissue, especially in the base of the tongue, must be resected more deeply. Resection extends to the hyoid bone. Caudally, the resection extends into the piriform sinus. Laterally to the edge of the left vallecula, it also includes the entire part of the lingual mucosa of the epiglottis and the caudal base of the tongue. The specimen is thread-marked for frozen section. There are still infiltrates caudally in the direction of the piriform sinus and laterally to the left in the direction of the vallecula. After consultation with the pathologists, no tumor infiltrates. At the same time, a marginal sample taken from the base of the tongue was unremarkable, as was the mucosa taken from the lingual epiglottis on the left. Thus, tumor infiltrates of the marginal sample of the left lateral vallecula, which was thread-marked, and the marginal sample of the caudal piriform sinus and, after evaluation of the tumor specimen, laterally towards the pharyngeal wall. Therefore, another extensive resection of the mucosal tissue from the left vallecula to the left pharyngeal wall was performed. Subsequently, a marginal sample is taken at the transition from the epiglottis to the left pharyngeal wall, which is also thread-marked for the frozen section. No more infiltrates here. The tonsil blocker is then inserted and an extensive resection is performed from the base of the tongue via the tonsil lobe to the lateral palatal arch. A strip of mucosa measuring at least 1 to 1.5 cm is resected here. Then a lateral margin sample is taken, which is marked with a thread. This marginal sample is also tumor-free. A resection is then performed from the caudal area or the piriform sinus, at least 1 to 1.5 cm wide. Then a marginal sample is taken from the caudal area or piriform sinus. This shows tumor infiltrates in the frozen section, whereby the tumor does not grow in the mucosa but in the underlying muscle layer. The right basal margin sample was tumor-free. The overall picture is that of a very extensive G3 squamous cell carcinoma growing like a sheet, which has grown into the soft tissue anteriorly towards the hyoid bone and in particular has undermined the mucosa and grown caudally into the piriform sinus and cannot be resected R0 from transorally. Overall, a wallpaper-like or mosaic-like, flat growth. Due to the overall situation, initial indication for tracheostomy. This is performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. (<CLINICIAN_NAME>) Tracheotomy: Now transition to tracheotomy. Injection of local anesthetic and sterile draping in the usual manner. Then mark the important landmarks and make the skin incision just below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection under bipolar coagulation through the cutaneous fatty tissue. Exposure of the straight neck muscles and transection in the linea alba. Push the muscles laterally. Subsequent careful dissection of the cricoid cartilage. This works well. Now undermine the thyroid isthmus and coagulate the isthmus in detail and carefully cut through it. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the trachea. This is also successful. Therefore, incision between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp and suturing of the skin cranially and caudally. Then carefully withdraw the tube and insert the tracheal cannula. This is successful without any further problems. The tube is then removed in the usual manner. Then re-inspection of the oropharynx and extensive coagulation in the resection area by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Ultimately, many isolated bleedings can still be stopped. Termination of the procedure without bleeding, without complications. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Overall, very extensive growth of a G3 squamous cell carcinoma, mainly extensive and undermining the mucosa, partly also extending into the soft tissue. Due to the overall situation, it is highly questionable whether extensive surgery, especially from the outside, is advisable, as the entire hypopharynx may fall and a flap plasty may occur, resulting in significant dysphagia. Dysphagia is pre-programmed anyway due to the extensive laser resection, hence tracheotomy. Neck dissection should be performed in the interval after approx. 10 to 14 days, which was no longer performed due to the resection of the pharynx from the inside. Finally, after neck dissection, indication for radiochemotherapy.","Laser resection, Tracheotomy with mucocutaneous anastomosis

The above-mentioned surgery was therefore indicated.,"First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again. Insertion of the McIvor blade. Inspection of the tumor. This extends from next to the uvula over the tonsil and lateral pharynx area to the base of the tongue. Placement of the PEG: insertion of the esophagoscope. After creating the diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube in a typical manner without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall typically without any problems. First start with tumor removal transorally: tumor is incised on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1 to 1.5 cm and is extirpated in toto. The soft palate up to the uvula, the tonsil and adjacent pharyngeal side wall as well as the caudal mucosa up to the hypopharyngeal junction or the junction at the base of the tongue are removed. Tumor is thread-marked. Basally another marginal sample. In the frozen section in all directions in healthy tissue, except caudally, where there is still growth under the epithelium in the soft tissue. Therefore, resection from the outside is indicated. The patient is now positioned and all relevant surgical areas are disinfected. First neck dissection on the left: Skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein, internal/external carotid artery. Exposure and preservation of hypoglossal nerve and vagus nerve. Clearing out levels II to V while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Subsequent transection and removal of the digastric muscle. Removal of the submandibular gland. Skeletonization of the hypoglossal nerve again. Exposure of the facial artery up to the exit from the area of the lingofacial trunk. The lingual artery is severed and struck caudally with the facial artery. Now overview of the tumor with defect in the pharyngeal space. Extensive resection of the soft tissue in the caudal margin of the former tumor, whereby the hyoid bone, superior cornu and parts of the external musculature around the hyoid bone are also resected up to the beginning of the vallecula. Subsequently, extensive marginal sampling of the mucosa caudally from the pharyngeal wall over the piriform sinus to the arytenoid region, with soft tissue underneath and with preservation of the superior laryngeal nerve. In addition, extensive soft tissue resection in the area of the vallecula. The latter two go to the frozen section. No more tumor infiltrates, thus R0 situation. Definitive indication for defect coverage using a radial flap. Neck dissection on the right by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Marking of the skin incision in consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Incision of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Incision of the platysma with protection of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Attachment of the upper edge of the platysma and subplatysmal dissection approx. 1.5 cm cranially until the submandibular gland is exposed. Open the glandular capsule and elevate the capsule to protect the marginal nerve. Attachment of the lower platysma margin and subplatysmal dissection approx. 1 cm caudally. Exposure of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid bone. Exposure of the posterior venter of the digastric muscle and dissection along the muscle ventrally to the hyoid bone. Dissection along the sternocleidomastoid muscle in depth to the cervical plexus. Division of the neck preparation from caudal to cranial along the internal jugular vein. Identification of the hypoglossal nerve and the accessorius nerve. The neck preparation (lateral) is detached from the deep cervical fascia from cranial to caudal. Care is taken to spare the branches of the cervical plexus and the accessory nerve. The common carotid artery and the vagus nerve are exposed. All structures can be preserved. Overall, regions Ib to IV are included in the neck preparation. After removal of the lateral preparation, the medial preparation is now prepared and removed. The branches of the external carotid artery can be left intact. Irrigation of the wound with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Overall, the wound is completely dry. Placement of a 10-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure with a platysma and skin suture. Tracheostoma creation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Transition to tracheostomy. A skin incision is made 1.5 QF below the thyroid cartilage. Careful dissection up to the trachea with careful hemostasis. Transverse incision of the trachea between two cartilages while protecting the tracheal tube. The operation is now briefly interrupted to suture in the flap. This is performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequent mobilization of the subcutaneous tissue and mucocutaneous epithelialization by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The radialis flap is now elevated from the left forearm. Mark the size of the flap on the forearm approx. 9 x 6 cm. First cut around the flap from the ulnar side. Extend the incision towards the crook of the elbow. Exposure and preservation of the superficial venous system. Subsequent subfascial elevation of the flap from the radial side. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. Exposure of the radial artery caudally. This is first clamped off. Flap is further elevated subfascially from ulnar and radial. The vascular pedicle is exposed up to the elbow. Connection between superficial and deep venous system is visualized. Venous outlets from the superficial venous system can be visualized. The radial artery is then severed and treated using 4.0 Prolene single button sutures using the puncture technique. Hand always well perfused up to this point, saturation at 100 %. Lifting of the flap subfascially. Smaller vessels are ligated or clipped or treated bipolarly. Lift up to the elbow area, here the radial artery and the vein of the deep venous system can be visualized. These are relatively small. However, there are 3 large veins of the superficial venous system, which are connected to the deep venous system. The flap is then removed. Veins are ligated. The brachial artery is supplied by puncture ligation. The flap is then flushed with heparin solution and preserved. Transition to defect coverage with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Marking of the graft. Cut around the graft and make a curved skin incision up to the elbow. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the cephalic vein and the outlets in the superficial system. Visualization of the venous confluence. Exposure of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve, which is spared. Exposure of the radial artery. Separation and transection of the radial artery. Lifting of the radial artery graft from the tendon bed and dissection of the pedicle up to the elbow. Removal of the pedicle while preserving the interosseous artery and the ulnar artery. One vein is lifted from the deep system and two veins from the superficial system. Suturing of the arm in the usual manner with coverage by split skin from the right thigh. Application of a dorsal forearm splint. Suturing of the graft largely from the transcervical side. Start suturing in the piriform sinus, then in the vallecula, then on the lateral pharyngeal wall and the last part transorally in the area of the soft palate and the edge of the tongue. The stalk is diverted to the left and connected to the lingual artery and the facial vein, the external jugular vein and another branch from the internal jugular vein. This means that a triple venous anastomosis and a single arterial anastomosis were performed. Insertion of a Redon drainage. Two-layer wound closure. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Antibiotics, which were started intraoperatively with Unacid, should be continued for 1 week. Control of the radial flap in a typical manner for 5 days according to the scheme. Continue herparin perfusor 500 units per hour for 5 days. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube. After 10 days, swallow porridge, then build up diet if necessary. Wait for the final histology and then presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference to plan further adjuvant therapy.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy creation

Exposure of the omohyoid and digastric muscles. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein, external jugular vein. Visualization of the internal/external carotid artery, superior thyroid artery, facial artery and lingual artery. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and various branches of the cervical plexus. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and the branches of the cervical plexus in the sense of neurolysis. Clearing of the lymph nodes. There are positive lymph nodes in the level II area, which means that level II to V are cleared. Here too, several suspicious, slightly enlarged lymph nodes in the lower area. Insertion of a Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure bandage. Insertion of a McIvor mouth blocker and inspection of the tumor region. The tumor originates from the left tonsil and spreads to the soft palate on the left side and infiltrates the anterior and posterior palatal arch. The uvula is not affected. However, the tumor extends to the base of the uvula. The tumor extends caudally into the glossotonsillar groove and infiltrates the base of the tongue on the left side. Subsequently, combined transoral-transcervical tumor resection: First cut through the digastric muscle. Removal of the submandibular gland. The duct is ligated. The lingual nerve is initially preserved from the caudal side. The facial artery is exposed up to the top and left intact. Pharyngeal wall is dissected away from the vessels, vessels are dissected away from the pharyngeal wall using vessel loops. The tumor is then resected under internal and external control with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm on all sides. The entire pharyngeal wall is removed. Resection extends cranially including the palatal arch and the soft tissue of the pterygoid muscles up to the hypopharyngeal entrance, laterally up to the alveolar ridge or mandible. The lingual nerve cannot be preserved due to the extent of the tumor and must also be resected. Resection extends forward to the floor of the mouth. The entire specimen is removed and marked with sutures. Additional marginal sample from the soft tissues superior basally. In the frozen section, both tumor and margin sample in healthy tissue. Thus R0 situation. Careful hemostasis. Measurement of the defect. This is approx. 11 x 8 cm. Neck dissection on the left. Skin incision in the usual manner on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Visualization of the omoyhoideus muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Dissection of the facial vein and the superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Removal of the neck preparation II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches and the cervical vessel sheath. Redon drainage. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure bandage. Lifting of the radialis graft on the left forearm. To do this, the graft is first marked. Then the cephalic vein, radial artery and ulnar artery are marked. Incision of the skin. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the cephalic vein and the basilic vein. Exposure of the confluence between the deep and superficial venous system. Visualization of the superficial ramus, radial nerve. Exposure of the radial artery. Ligation and stitching of the radial artery. Separation of the radial artery. Lifting the graft from the tendon bed. Dissection of the pedicle up to the elbow and removal of the graft, leaving several venous outlets and preserving the interosseous artery. Marking of the radial artery. Flushing of the entire graft with heparin solution. Lifting of split skin on the right thigh and defect coverage on the left forearm. Sewing on swabs to establish contact between the split skin and the wound bed. Sterile wound dressing and application of a dorsal forearm splint. Insertion of the graft into the oral cavity and start suturing in the area of the soft palate. The graft fits in well. It lies loosely and is sutured in successively, partly around the teeth in the area of the alveolar ridge. In the base of the tongue, transoral suturing is not possible. Here, suturing must be continued transcervically. This is somewhat complicated due to the lack of visibility and swelling of the tongue. Finally, the graft can be sutured in completely. Finally, the oral cavity and pharynx area is filled with Ringer's solution. There is no secretion flowing into the neck area. Dissection of the facial vein, the external jugular vein and the superior thyroid artery as connecting vessels. In addition, an outlet is prepared on the facial artery for a third vein. Anastomosis of the arterial vessels and ultimately also the venous vessels. Unfortunately, even if venous return is initially very good, arterial perfusion still stops intraoperatively. The arterial anastomosis must therefore be reopened and it becomes apparent that an occlusion has occurred in the anastomosis area due to previous damage to the superior thyroid artery. The thyroid artery must be cut back until there is no longer so much arteriosclerotic plaque material in the vessel. However, there is also previous damage here and the arterial anastomosis must again be performed very carefully. The graft is now permanently well perfused and a Redon drain is inserted. Two-layer wound closure. Final consultation with the anesthetist. The patient is ventilated in the intensive care unit and should receive antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Usual flap checks.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheostomy creation, PEG placement, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

A CT scan showed a herniated thyroid cartilage or herniation into the left laryngeal skeleton, therefore the above-mentioned operation was indicated.","First, laryngoscopy and pharyngoscopy again: The exophytic tumor is seen, which is located in the piriform sinus on the left, passes to the vallecula of the epiglottis and also grows into the larynx via the arytenoid fold. Transition also to the postcricoid region. Indication for surgery thus confirmed. Skin disinfection, injection of a total of 20 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline in the area of the sides of the neck and sterile draping of all surgical areas. First, create an apron flap in the typical manner, subplatysmal to the level of the hyoid bone and submandibular gland. Then neck dissection on both sides, initially on the right: same procedure on both sides. Dissection of the lymph node packages from the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. The lymph nodes are then removed from 2 to 5, followed by neck dissection on the left side in the same way. All structures are exposed and preserved as on the opposite side, including the superior thyroid artery. This is followed by laryngectomy with subtotal pharyngectomy: skeletonization of the larynx. Dissection of the suprahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone, which is removed due to the height of the tumor. Skeletonization of the grand......... on the right side and as far as possible on the left side. On the right, the constrictor pharyngeus is dissected from the laryngeal skeleton. This must be largely omitted on the left side, where the constrictor muscles are largely resected as well. Also resection of infrahyoid muscles and lymph nodes up to level VI. Entry into the larynx from the cranial paramedian on the right. Release of the epiglottis, exposure of the tumor. The tumor was previously operated on transorally from the cranial side and the cranial resection margin was marked. A marginal sample from the cranial resection area was in healthy tissue. The tumor is now resected on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1.5 to 2 cm, taking into account the cranial resection margins. Pharynx falls largely to the posterior wall on the left. The postcricoid region is also resected up to just in front of the esophageal entrance. The trachea had already been exposed previously. The lobes of the thyroid gland were clamped, severed and treated with puncture ligatures. The thyroid gland was pushed off caudo-laterally. The larynx was then removed, leaving the trachea extended cranially and dorsally. Then mark the laryngectomy and pharyngectomy specimen. A relatively wide marginal sample is taken from the left pharyngeal wall area and a marginal sample from the tongue base area. However, with free tumor margins around the tumor specimen, the margin sample, which was also taken from the pharyngeal wall area, still shows carcinoma in situ. This indicates discontinuous growth. The marginal sample from the base of the tongue was clear. Further resection in the entire pharyngeal wall area from caudal to cranial left. Removal of a representative marginal sample. This still shows moderate dysplasia. Thus overall R0 situation. No evidence of invasive carcinoma. A 2-4 cm strip of residual pharynx remains. Defect coverage using a radial flap is therefore necessary. The radial flap is removed from the left forearm. Mark the size of the flap, which is 15 x 8-9 cm. Create a tourniquet. Then lift the flap first from the ulnar side, from here extend the incision in the crook of the elbow. Subsequent mobilization of the flap from the radial side, including the superficial venous system and underneath the fascia. Exposure of the vascular pedicle below the brachioradialis muscle. Mobilization of the flap from below after the radial artery, which is supplied with blood by means of a tourniquet, has been removed. Successive elevation of the flap with clipping or bipolar supply of branches. The connection between the deep and superficial venous system is shown in the crook of the elbow. A total of 3 venous connections of the confluence or cephalic vein can be visualized. Good perfusion after opening the tourniquet. Flap remains in perfusion until the R0 situation is established. Then remove the flap. Ligatures in the area of the veins and puncture ligature with 4-0 prolene in the area of the artery shortly before entering the brachial artery. Remaining hand well perfused. Flap is flushed with heparin and preserved. A piece of full-thickness skin of the appropriate size is removed from the groin area in the typical manner. Here a groin after skin mobilization. Closure in layers using multi-layered subcutaneous sutures and back-stitch skin sutures after insertion of a Redon drain with relatively little tension. The forearm wound is closed in layers in the cranial area in a typical manner. The defect is now covered by the full-thickness skin graft and the full-thickness skin graft is successively incorporated here using 4-0 Ethilon sutures. A Hydrogel-Mebilex dressing is then applied. Application of loose compresses. Wrapping in absorbent cotton. Fitting of a Cramer splint and wrapping of the arm with an elastic bandage. Then cover the defect with a radial flap: Radialis flap is inserted into the defect and successively incorporated using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Complete tension-free closure. Flap pedicle is transferred to the right side. After conditioning the vessels, first anastomosis of the radial artery with the superior thyroid artery using 8-0 Ehtilon single button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and good venous return. The vein is confluent with the radial vein and is anastomosed with an outlet from the facial vein using a 2.5 mm coupler; good venous return also after opening the clamps. After conditioning, the cephalic vein is anastomosed with the external jugular vein using a 2.5 mm coupler; good venous flow can also be registered here. The residual veins are clipped and bipolized. Careful irrigation of the surgical site and hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain on both sides. Particularly deep fixation on the right in the anastomosis region. Trachea is epithelized in a typical manner. Finally, insertion of a 10 mm tracheal cannula which is fixed with sutures. No dressing. Patient goes to intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue intraoperative therapy with heparin 500 E/hour for 5 days. Flap control by means of Doppler and clinically via laryngoscope insertion according to scheme. Please continue antibiotic therapy with Unacid, which was started intraoperatively, for at least 2 days. Nutrition via the previously inserted PEG tube for at least 10 days. Total cT4a cN2c hypopharyngeal carcinoma left. Discuss postoperative radiotherapy versus radiochemotherapy.  ","Laryngectomy with subtotal pharyngectomy, Neck Dissection

PEG insertion first: The esophagoscope is inserted into the stomach without any problems. Inconspicuous conditions there. Good diaphanoscopy. Insertion of the PEG using the thread pull-through method in the usual way without complications. Now adjustment of the laryngeal entrance and the epiglottis with the spreading laryngoscope. A tumor can be seen on the laryngeal epiglottis, which, as described above, touches the aryepiglottic fold on the right, extends to the arytenoid cartilage and infiltrates into the pocket fold. In addition, the vocal fold is not fully reached on the right side. On the left, extending beyond the median line, moving towards the pocket fold, but clearly not reaching the vocal fold here. First of all, cutting around the entire epiglottis with the laser and partial resection of the upper and cranial part of the tumor. Resection anteriorly up to the pre-epiglottic fatty tissue. Splitting of the epiglottis attachment in the area of the petiolus and initial removal and resection of the tumor in the left larynx, up to the pocket crease, into the anterior commissure and into the pre-epiglottic fatty tissue. Resection clinically in healthy tissue. After resection of this part, incision of the aryepiglottic fold and insertion into the larynx. Resection of the entire pocket fold. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage and resection up to the vocal fold. The lower part of the vocal fold remains completely intact up to the anterior commissure at the transition to the left pocket fold. Finally, resection in the area of the right arytenoid. Another piece is removed here. Clinically now complete resection of the tumor. Thyroid cartilage partially exposed or still covered with perichondrium in some places. Circular margin samples are now taken, all of which are found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. An R0 resection can be assumed. Extensive hemostasis during the operation with repeated monopolar and bipolar coagulation. Finally, insertion of a swab with H2O2. This is removed again at the end of the operation. Repositioning of the patient and neck dissection with tracheotomy. Tumor resection was performed (previous procedure by <CLINICIAN_NAME>) Takeover now for neck dissection on both sides. Beginning on the right side: An existing old scar can be seen in the area of the larynx. This is also used for the incision. Therefore, an atypical incision is made here in order to take the old scar structure with it. Dissect down to the sternocleidomastoid. Locate the omohyoid muscle and digaster muscle as the upper and lower structure. Locate the accessorius nerve. Dissecting along the vein. Locating the vagus nerve. Removal of the lateral neck preparation. Now remove the medial neck preparation including the submandibular capsule. Locate and protect the hypoglossal nerve. Irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer. Insertion of a Redon drainage. Subcutaneous suture. Skin suture. Summary: Several suspicious lymph nodes, especially in region III. Now repositioning and start on the left side: Here now slightly similar incision as on the right in the area of the tension lines in order to maintain symmetry. Dissect down to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissect down to the omohyoid and digaster. Locate the accessorius nerve. It can now be seen that the bulb of the carotid artery is located laterally, the vagus nerve is on the outside and the vein itself is located medially as a normal variant. Locate the hypoglossal nerve. This is also prominently exposed. The lateral neck preparation is now dissected out, possibly sparing the plexus branches, as on the right side. The medial parts of the neck and the submandibular capsule are also removed. Followed by hydrogen irrigation, Ringer irrigation. Insertion of a Redon drainage. Subcutaneous suture. Skin suture. Regio III/IV enlarged nodes also appeared on the left side. Now repositioning and tracheotomy: Kocher collar incision. Dissection down to the thyroid gland. Undermining of the same.

In the tumor conference, the decision was made to perform endoral tumor resection without flap plasty and neck dissection on both sides.","Induction and intubation by the anesthetist. Positioning of the head and insertion of wound blocks in the oral cavity. Snaring of the tongue and exposure of the tumor. The tumor is endophytic on the left side of the tongue wall and grows to the midline at the base of the tongue. The tip of the tongue is free on both sides. First mark the edges of the incision using a monopolor needle. Now start the resection in the area of the raphe, in the middle of the tongue and in the posterior tongue area. Here, the raphe is moved strictly downwards. The tumor is palpated at a safe distance from the cutting edge. Further dissection with scissors and forceps. First resection of the medial part, carefully moving from the surface of the tongue downwards and then forwards towards the tip of the tongue. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Now dissect the base of the tongue. Here too, use scissors, forceps and bipolar coagulation. The anterior palatal arch must also be partially resected as far as the mucosa is concerned. The tonsil is left in situ as it is not palpatorily infiltrated. Now dissect the outer edge of the tongue and proceed towards the tip of the tongue. The lingual artery is encountered. This is carefully coagulated and ligated. Expose the lingual nerve, which can be completely preserved. Further resection in the mucosal area of the floor of the mouth. The submandibular gland must be partially resected. The Wharton's duct can be identified and spared. Excision of the tumor with scissors and forceps under bipolar coagulation. Larger blood vessels are carefully coagulated and ligated. Further hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. The entire tumor preparation is thread-marked and sent to the frozen section. In the frozen section itself, all margins were assessed as free. However, in the basal wound area, the resection was described as just in the healthy area. A 1.5 x 3 x 4 cm slice was resected here later. This was ultimately declared tumor-free in a further frozen section. A total of 2/3 of the anterior part of the tongue was preserved. The tip of the tongue itself is completely preserved. A 1/3 resection was performed in the posterior area. The lingual nerve and Wharton's duct were completely preserved. Repositioning, injection and covering for neck dissection on both sides. Start of the modified, radical neck dissection on the left side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Skin incision. Separation of the platysma and formation of a small platysmal flap in the ventral area. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Locate the omohyoid muscle and expose it. Then turn to the cranial region and locate the submandibular gland, which is also well visualized. Locate the internal jugular vein. Now completely release the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sparing the external jugular vein. Release of the upper neck block. This shows some enlarged lymph nodes, which were all removed. Exposure of the facial vein, which could be completely preserved. Finding the superior thyroid artery. This was also completely preserved, but is very thin and slender. Now turn to the internal jugular vein. This is triggered by fat and connective tissue. Release of the superficial fatty tissue cranial to the omohyoid muscle. Further evacuation of the fatty tissue lying above the plexus. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Release of level IIb above the accessory nerve. Irrigation and bipolar coagulation to stop bleeding. Turn to the opposite side and perform the modified radical neck dissection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Skin incision and similar procedure as on the left side. First separation of the platysma and formation of a small platysmal flap in the ventral area. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and release of this muscle. Finding the external jugular vein. This can remain completely intact. Locate the lower border by exposing the omohyoid muscle. Then locate the upper border by exposing the submandibular gland. Then start releasing the upper neck block, beginning at the omohyoid muscle. Release of the fatty tissue in this area. No lymph nodes are visible. At the level of the superior thyroid artery, no further dissection is carried out downwards. The superior thyroid artery itself is also a very slender vessel on this side. However, it can be completely preserved. Exposure and release of the internal jugular vein. The facial vein is exposed and completely preserved. Removal of fatty tissue which lies above the plexus. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and release of the upper accessorius triangle. Wound irrigation with H202 and Ringer. Bipolar coagulation to stop bleeding. Insertion of Redon drains on both sides. During the neck dissection on both sides, all relevant vessels for a possible subsequent flap plasty were preserved (external jugular vein, facial vein, internal jugular vein, superior thyroid artery). The patient is now repositioned and the resection in the basal wound bed described above is performed. Then turn to the tracheotomy. Skin incision just below the cricoid cartilage. Now dissect in depth. Push the infrahyoid muscles to the side. A very small thyroid gland is now encountered. This can be pushed completely to the side and does not have to be severed. Removal of connective tissue on the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd cricoid cartilage into the trachea. Unfortunately, this breaks the cuff. Formation of a basally pedicled Björk flap downwards. Incision of the Björk flap and the upper and lateral tracheal margin in the usual manner. Re-intubation. Now check the mouth and tongue area again. Remaining hemostasis here. End of the operation with dry blood. Conclusion: According to the frozen section, the tumor was resected in sano at all edges. The tip of the tongue, the lingual nerve, Wharton's and Wharton's canal were preserved. The lingual artery was carefully ligated. During the neck dissection, all vessels necessary for a possible flap plasty were preserved. If a flap plasty is required secondarily to improve function, a radial flap is recommended.

Indication for tumor tonsillectomy with neck dissection on the right if necessary.,"Preliminary consultation with the anesthetist. Then setting up with the tonsil retractor. There is a mass in the area of the right tonsil which does not reach the base of the tongue, extends laterally to just before the lower jaw and obviously does not exceed the upper tonsil pole of the tonsil cranially. Cut around this tumorous mass in the area of the right tonsil. Careful dissection of the tumor, which can be assessed intraoperatively in healthy tissue. The anterior and posterior palatal arch is completely resected and the pharyngeal musculature is partially resected. Careful dissection along the tumor and removal of the tumor in the area of the base of the tongue. Considering the size of the tumor, dissection conditions are considerably more difficult. Careful hemostasis. Sending the specimen for frozen section examination. A resection in healthy tissue is determined. Nevertheless, representative marginal samples are taken at all levels. As far as can be assessed intraoperatively, the tumor is completely removed. The resection extends to the base of the uvula on the right side and also includes the posterior palatal arch, so that the possibility of the patient regurgitating during spontaneous healing cannot be ruled out with certainty. For this reason, no further measures at this time. First wait for the clinical course. Should regurgitation occur, a radial flap would be indicated, so that exploration of the right neck is not carried out at the present time. Initially reconstruction of the posterior palatal arch with parts of the uvula. Suturing of the uvula with its base to the right, resulting in closure of the nasopharynx in the functional sense. Due to the large wound bed, tracheotomy is now indicated. Local anesthesia is placed below the larynx. Abjode and cover the surgical site. Incision. Exposure of the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the linea alba, the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus after appropriate ligation. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Entering the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring and creating a small tracheostoma. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma and reintubation of the patient.

Subsequent inspection of the oral cavity after suturing the tip of the tongue. The previously described exophytic process of the posterior edge of the tongue on the right with transition to the right tongue base, the glossotonsillar groove or the lower tonsillar pole on the right is seen. Demonstration of the findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and determination of the resection margins. On palpation, the tumor extends into the base of the tongue with a cone, but is superficial towards the tip of the tongue or the anterior edge of the tongue. Now dissect the tumor with sufficient safety distance using bipolar coagulation and scissors from anterior to posterior. The tumor cone described above can be seen in the base of the tongue, resulting in a deeper resection in the sense of a one-third resection of the base of the tongue. In addition, the suspicious mucosal area towards the oropharyngeal side wall or tonsil is resected in the sense of a tumor tonsillectomy after further consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME> with a sufficient macroscopic safety margin. Hemostasis with bipolar coagulation and H202. Subsequent removal of circular margin samples, anterior tongue margin, lower tongue margin, upper tongue margin, tongue base and pharyngeal wall. These are all found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. It can therefore be assumed that the resection was R0 on the basis of markoscopy and microscopy. Now demonstration of the findings and discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Indication for level I to V neck dissection on the right and level II to V on the left. Start with neck dissection on the right: repositioning of the patient, infiltration anesthesia and skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle with an auxiliary submental incision.

The accessorius nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, the deep cervical artery and the branches of the cervicobrachial plexus, these structures are all spared and the lateral neck preparation is now cleared out caudally starting at the accessorius triangle. Several enlarged nodes can be seen. There is also a nodule in the medial neck preparation, here appearing suspiciously in the vein angle. Clearing of the medial neck preparation and further preparation with removal of the capsule of the submandibular gland anteriorly and submentally, here clearing of the fatty tissue, but no suspicious findings on palpation.

The patient now presents with a histologically confirmed carcinoma in situ (grade III intraepithelial neoplasia). Endoscopy revealed a very uneven mucosa, raised above the normal mucosal level, primarily affecting the left pocket fold. Therefore indication for the above mentioned operation.","After induction of anesthesia, tracheoscopy is first performed with 0 degree optics. This reveals a subglottic protrusion of a tracheal cartilage with a slight narrowing of the tracheal lumen by approx. 20 %. However, the mucosa is not irritated. Now orotracheal intubation by the surgeon. Then proceed to flexible esophagogastroscopy. Mucosal conditions are normal on all sides, even in the cardia area after inversion and in the pylorus area. No further abnormalities of the esophagus when the endoscope is withdrawn. Now proceed to panendoscopy. Apart from the tumor described below, there are no other abnormalities in the entire oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and laryngeal region. The tumor itself is a clearly uneven mucosal region with elevation and a slightly exophytic aspect in the area of the left pocket fold, which also affects the upper side of the left vocal fold in its central area via the morgue sinus. The anterior region and also the anterior commissure are tumor-free. The free aryepiglottic fold is not affected, but the tumor grows over into the ary region in the posterior part of the pocket fold and the vocal fold also appears relatively unsteady in the area of the vocal process. Now repeated consultation of <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>, which ultimately indicated the performance of laser resection with frozen section examinations. The anterior section is now set to 3 watt continuous mode with the CO2 laser and the left pocket fold is resected. The anterior part of the left vocal fold is then also resected with the laser in its upper part up to the free edge. The vocal cord can be preserved if the findings are relatively superficial, as can the vocalis muscle. Now setting the posterior side. Here the resection extends over the pocket fold to the free aryepiglottic fold and then medially over the arytenoid cartilage almost to the interary region without entering it. Here, too, the findings are clearly superficial and the arytenoid cartilage itself can be preserved. Now, although there is no clinical suspicion that the mass is extending into the depths, the wound bed is resected again in the supraglottic area corresponding to the pocket crease, because the CT suggests that the tumor is deeper in this area. In between, repeated coagulation with the forceps and monopolar coagulation. Finally, frozen section diagnostics are performed. Six frozen sections are taken from the free edge of the glottis via the arytenoid region, in the wound bed along the pocket crease, again in the anterior pocket crease and in the anterior commissure area. All frozen sections were found to be tumor-free. Only the arytenoid region is removed with slight dysplasia. For this reason, a small strip is recut in this area. In between, careful hemostasis with placement of supra-swabs. Placement of a feeding tube, which should be left in place for 7 days. Intraoperative administration of 3 g Unacid, which should be continued for 24 hours, and 250 mg SDH single-shot. Conclusion: cT2 ycN0 supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma with involvement of the morgue sinus and vocal fold on the left side. R0 resection in the frozen section. Further procedure after receipt of the final histology, whereby it should be discussed in the tumor conference whether a new neck dissection can be dispensed with in the case of ycN0 neck status and pre-treatment of the patient.","Transoral laser resection, Panendoscopy

After induction of anesthesia, a new pharyngo-laryngoscopy is performed, confirming the findings of the preliminary examination. Comparison with the CT findings. It was found that the tumor was relatively well encapsulated, a cN0 situation was present, therefore now after esophagogastroscopy with good diaphanoscopy and insertion of the troicart. After alcohol disinfection, infiltration anesthesia, placement of the PEG tube in the typical manner and subsequent insertion of the tonsil plug. The overview is poor with restricted mouth opening, especially of the caudal part, so that the combined transoral, transcervical approach is preferred. Reposition the patient for this. Alcohol disinfection. Infiltration anesthesia and preforming of a platysmal flap. To do this, first make a skin incision into the subcutaneous tissue. Cut around the suspected defect in the supraclavicular area, lift off the skin laterally and medially of the neck incision above the platysma. Expose the platysma at the level of the clavicle. Separation of the same. Here and fixation sutures skin platysma. Then carefully dissect cranially, taking the platysma and the surrounding connective tissue structures up to the capsule of the submandibular gland and preserving the facial artery and vein. Now expose the cervical vascular sheath, expose the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve as well as the accessorius nerve. Clearing out the lateral neck preparation from the omohyoid to the digaster, sparing the aforementioned structures and the main plexus branches. Exposure of the medial neck preparation and removal of the same, including the capsule of the submandibular gland and preservation of the other structures mentioned, including the artery and superior vein. Now dissect the ventral part of the digastric muscle and the styloid muscle. Dissection of the same. Counterpalpation of oral and cervical. The smoothly bordered tumor can be seen and that when entering the pharynx one emerges just caudal to the hypoglossus below the tumor. Therefore, re-insertion of the tonsil stop, cutting around the tumor from the cranial side, including the anterior palatal arch, parts of the soft palate and the lateral pharyngeal wall up to the alveolar ridge. Dissection clearly macroscopically in healthy tissue, including muscle layers on the tumor. Now dissect caudally as far as this is possible without complications, then open the pharynx below the tumor and cut around the caudal parts of the tumor under visual control. Development of the complete tumor specimen which is sent for final histology. Forming a resection in the area cranial to the entrance to the operation, as submucosal growth could not be ruled out by palpation. Subsequently, representative marginal samples are taken circularly. All of these, including the tongue margin sample, were found to be tumor-free by <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the pathology department, so that a safe R0 resection can be assumed. After careful hemostasis and wound irrigation, the caudal pharyngeal opening is widened so that the flap stalk is not trapped; the lingual artery is cut and severed for this purpose. The flap is then swung into the defect; this is achieved without tension up to the upper palatal arch, where the flap is adapted to the mucosal borders and the posterior palatal arch. The uvula remains freely movable. Adaptation to the caudal side. Now turn towards the transverical and reduce the pharyngeal access. Then suture the accompanying connective and fatty tissue of the flap pedicle with the pharyngeal musculature to create a complete closure. Finally, insertion of a Redon drainage and two-layer wound closure by forming a Burrow triangle can achieve complete primary closure. Please apply a pressure dressing to the lower third of the neck scar, never to the cranial third. If problems occur, the lateral part of the flap can be primarily released from the suture and sutured again secondarily.","Tumor tonsillectomy on the right, Right neck dissection, Pharyngeal reconstruction, Pedicled flap (Platysma), PEG placement, Endoscopy

Then insertion of the Da Vinci retractor and inspection of the tumor region. A 2-3 cm large tumor is found at the lower pole of the tonsil with transition to the base of the tongue. The robotic arms are then advanced and tumor resection begins at the cranial edge. The tumor is cut around, taking most of the tonsil and part of the base of the tongue and the glossotonsillar fold with it. Basally, the soft tissues of the neck are reached very far, so that the neck fat and also parts of the submandibular gland are exposed and pulsating vessels are palpable and visible through the fat. For this reason, a neck dissection is not performed in this procedure, as otherwise a thorough defect would occur. Due to the extent of the defect and recurrent bleeding during the tumor resection, the decision was made to perform a small tracheotomy. First, however, the neck dissection was performed on the left side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. For this, skin incision in the usual manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Showing the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, hypoglossus and cervical anus. Then evacuation of levels IIa to IV while sparing the plexus branches. Insertion of a Redon drainage and two-layer wound closure. Finally, the tracheotomy is performed in the usual manner. For this, skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection down to the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea and creation of a visor tracheotomy between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis and reintubation to a 9 mm tracheal cannula. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit postoperatively and was given a nasogastric tube to be fed for 5 days.

In addition, moderately differentiated circumscribed esophageal carcinoma. After endoscopic mucosal resection of the esophageal carcinoma by the colleagues in internal medicine, the indication for primary surgical treatment of the oral cavity carcinoma was made. Preoperative imaging revealed a cT2-cT3 cN2b oral cavity carcinoma on the right.","Introductory consultation with the anesthetist. Start of PEG insertion: For this purpose, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Problem-free pre-laryngoscopy into the stomach. Excellent diaphanoscopy. Problem-free puncture of the stomach. Subsequent problem-free PEG insertion using the usual suture pull-through method. The esophagus is inconspicuous on the endoscopy and regular postoperatively. The primary tumor region is now inspected: an exophytic mass measuring approx. 4x2 cm with transition to the lateral floor of the mouth and a small tumor extension towards the anterior floor of the mouth can be seen in the area of the free edge of the tongue on the right. In addition, the glossotonsillar groove is reached. The tonsil is rough and scarred with a questionable tumor extension into the tonsil region. After radical exposure of the tumor, successive resection is performed with sufficient macroscopic safety margin. The tumor is resected using an electric needle and dissection technique. The tumor has grown relatively superficially with hardly any deep infiltrations in the area of the tongue and the floor of the mouth. Basally, a sufficient safety margin was maintained on all sides and successive resection was performed, including the free edge of the tongue on the right and the floor of the mouth with partial resection of the sublingual and submandibular gland. The transition to the base of the tongue itself is again free. Removal of the glossotonsillar groove and, in the case of a questionable tumor extension into the tonsil, removal of the tonsil with subtotal removal of the anterior palatal arch. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation and ligation of stronger vessels. The tumor is now macroscopically visible on the specimen in sano-resected form. Slightly narrower margin in the area of the anterior floor of the mouth. A basal and anterior resection is performed here. The tumor is now completely imaged with margin samples. Residual carcinoma can be seen just submucosally in the area of the anterior floor of the mouth. In addition, CIS in the area of the lateral floor of the mouth and in the area of the dorsum of the tongue. Low-grade dysplasia in the area of the soft palate without higher-grade dysplasia, also in the intraoperative reclassification. A generous resection is now performed in the area of the anterior floor of the mouth and re-covered with a marginal specimen. Additional resection in the area of the lateral floor of the mouth and in the area of the edge of the tongue. The anterior floor of the mouth is now tumor-free with no high-grade dysplasia, the tongue margin is free with only minor dysplasia and CIS remains in the area of the lateral floor of the mouth. A new resection is performed here. CIS with additional evidence of invasive carcinoma is also seen here. Therefore, sharp incision of the alveolar ridge mucosa. Incision down to the periosteum. Removal of the entire mucosa and obtaining a generous, flat resection, which is then resected in a thread-oriented manner for frozen section diagnostics. The carcinoma in situ is found to have been removed in sano. Therefore, an R0 situation can be assumed overall. Due to the extensive enoral soft tissue defect involving the submandibular gland, a simultaneous neck dissection is not performed in this session. Also due to the extensive wound area and incipient swelling tendency, a supporting tracheotomy is performed. For this purpose, a horizontal skin incision is made below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose the infrahyoid musculature. Entering the linea alba. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea and transection of the thyroid isthmus. Insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma. Subsequent easy intubation with a size 8 low cuff cannula, followed by careful and repeated irrigation of the enoral wound area. Meticulous hemostasis and termination of the procedure at this point if the enoral conditions are dry. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected at least cT2 cN2b oral cavity carcinoma on the right with extensive perifocal dysplasia and perifocal CIS. Overall, extensive field carcinomatization can also be assumed here. The necessary neck dissection on both sides should be planned in the 2nd session in approx. 2 weeks. Primary secondary wound healing should initially be aimed for enorally. With proper enoral healing and proper food build-up, prompt decannulation should be possible. Postoperative consultation with the anesthesiologist.","Pharyngeal partial resection, PEG placement, Tracheotomy, PE (Proximal esophagus)

Laryngectomy now indicated for extensive findings. Hence the above-mentioned procedure.,"First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again, showing the exophytic tumor, which runs from the interary area centrally over both vocal folds, the anterior commissure to the arytenoid region on the left. Overall, not a large voluminous tumor, but rather a very extensive flat finding, which makes a larynx-preserving procedure inappropriate. Cartilage infiltration in the area of the anterior commissure, at least from the inside, cannot be ruled out. Therefore, repositioning for surgical therapy. Skin disinfection. Sterile draping. Injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline in the area of the planned incision. Then elevation of the apron flap and neck dissection on both sides. Start with the neck dissection on the left side: dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure and protection of the XI nerve. Dissection of the cranial border with exposure of the lower edge of the gl. submandibularis and the digaster muscle. Locate and dissect the omohyoid muscle. No macroscopically suspicious nodes. On this side, regions Ib-V are completely removed while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. Transition to neck dissection on the right side, here the procedure is carried out in the same way. Final demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>."" Subsequent laryngectomy: Dissection of the suprahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone, which is completely skeletonized. Exposure of the superior chorda on both sides and release of this on both sides. Exposure of the thyroid gland on both sides, transection of the isthmus. Thyroid gland is dissected caudo-laterally on both sides. Infrahyoid muscles are detached from the hyoid bone and beaten downwards. Constrictor muscle, pharynx with pharyngeal tube is dissected away from the pharyngeal skeleton as far as possible. Tracheotomy is then performed. Re-intubation. Then enter the larynx in the area of the epiglottis. The area of the lingual epiglottis mucosa is spared as far as possible. Then successive release of the larynx with maximum preservation of the pharyngeal mucosa. Separate the laryngeal skeleton from the pharyngeal tube up to the beginning of the trachea. Here the larynx is set down in a typical manner. In the case of subglottic growth, creation of the tracheostoma in the typical manner. Larynx is sent in for frozen section, here in frozen section cranial and caudal in the area of the mucosal settling points or trachea and epiglottis in sano. Subsequently, myotomy on the left side in the typical manner. The muscles of the pharyngeal tube are severed. Then separation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the area of the medial insertions on both sides. Then insertion of a 10 mm Provox prosthesis in the typical manner. This is positioned correctly. Then closure of the pharynx in a single layer using single button sutures. Further inverted suture in the second layer. Suturing of the pharyngeal tube or constrictor pharyngis and suprahyoidal muscles cranially, also using single Vicryl 3-0 button sutures. Then irrigation and careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of Redon drainage on both sides and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Subsequent completion of the procedure without complications. Overall cT3-4 carcinoma endolaryngeal. Due to questionable cartilage infiltration to the front and the overall extension, laryngectomy was performed with neck dissection on both sides. Please feed via the inserted nasogastric tube for 8-10 days, then after swallowing gruel, if necessary, build up the diet. Please continue antibiotics, which were started with Unacid, for one week. After receiving the final histology, please attend the interdisciplinary tumor conference for further treatment planning.","Laryngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Provox insertion, Pharyngoscopy, Laryngoscopy

The panendoscopy revealed a squamous cell carcinoma G1.,"Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Then first sterile washing and draping of the neck area and performance of the tracheotomy by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>, here skin incision below the cricoid cartilage, preparation of the prelaryngeal musculature, splitting of the musculature at the linea alba. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, separation of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage.

Positive diaphanoscopy and problem-free placement of a PEG using the thread pull-through method without any problems. Dressing application. Transition to tracheotomy: positioning of the patient and marking of the incision and skin incision, subcutaneous preparation, pushing apart the infrahyoid muscles and exposing the thyroid isthmus. Undermining of the same, bipolar coagulation and separation of the isthmus from the trachea. Locate the space between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage and carefully enter. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Transfer to a laryngectomy tube. Repositioning for tumor removal and neck dissection, primarily on the right side. Injection of 10 ml local anesthetic with adrenaline along the planned incision and along the right side of the neck. Skin incision, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of its profound surface, exposure and sparing of the accessorius nerve. Exposure of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. Exposure and protection of the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Visualization of the vagus nerve. Dissection of the lateral neck preparation, transection in the cranial area. Removal of the submandibular gland together with the attached lymph nodes. Dissection and gentle removal of the facial artery as a connecting vessel for subsequent flap preparation. Separation of the facial vein. Dissection inferiorly and exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Further dissection in a superior direction and lifting of the medial neck preparation. Hemostasis and leaving the site open for later flap preparation. Simultaneously, the tumor is released enorally by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and counter-operated on transcervically. This is followed by transoral, transcervical tumor resection: first insertion of the Mc Ivor blade and re-inspection of the tumor. The tumor is mainly located in the middle to lower part of the tonsillar lobe, passing just over the base of the tongue and growing slightly towards the glosso-alveolar groove or alveolar ridge, but at a clear distance. The tumor is now removed macroscopically with a safety margin of at least 1.5 to even 2 cm on all sides. The anterior palatal arch, the tonsil and parts of the posterior palatal arch are removed. During removal, the bone on the alveolar ridge is also exposed at the back by pushing away the periosteum here. Caudal resection of parts of the base of the tongue is carried out here at a clear distance. The beginning of the posterior wall of the hypopharynx and posterior wall of the oropharynx is also resected. Due to the growth at one point in depth in the direction of the submandibular gland, the tumor is then resected from the transcervical side as part of the neck dissection. After cutting the digastric muscle, the submandibular gland is mobilized. The hypoglossal nerve is exposed and spared for this purpose. The lingual nerve was already severed during the resection from the enoral side, as it runs too close to the tumor or was infiltrated by the tumor. Glandula submandibularis is now pushed into the oral cavity en bloc with the tumor and attached soft tissue. It can be seen that the tumor was resected macroscopically with a wide safety margin on all sides. Nevertheless, another marginal sample was taken at the alveolar ridge extending to the glossotonsillar groove. Tumor is marked with a thread and sent for frozen section together with the marginal sample. The frozen section shows carcinoma in situ on all sides, partly with transition to microcarcinoma, only in the area of the posterior palatal arch there is no carcinoma in situ. A large strip of mucosa is now removed from the alveolar ridge, whereby the mucosa is removed down to the alveoli. In addition, a large resectate is removed from the caudal pharyngeal wall, as well as a wide resectate from the pharyngeal entrance, vallecula area to the base of the tongue. All resected specimens are sent for re-examination as frozen sections, with the sutures placed away from the tumor. Carcinoma in situ again in almost all specimens. After consultation with the pathologists, this appears to be a field carcinoma. Therefore, only the specimen in the caudal pharyngeal region appears to be free of tumor and no carcinoma in situ is detectable. This is followed by a final marginal sample from the vallecula/base of tongue area, where the sutures are again placed away from the tumor. However, this is no longer a frozen section examination but a final examination. It is no longer possible to take a mucosal sample from the alveolar ridge, as the resection has already reached the beginning of the alveolus. The mucosa is healthy towards the floor of the mouth. R1 affected areas are therefore the dorsal alveolar ridge and the base of the tongue/valley area. Overall tendency towards field carcinomatization after consultation with the pathologist. Neck dissection on the left side (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Injection of 10 ml ultracaine solution, making a skin incision from the mastoid at the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid caudally with a slight swing laterally. Expose the platysma. Create a platysma flap anteriorly, expose the sternocleidomastoid. Mobilization of the muscle, sharp dissection in depth up to the plexus branches. The cranial accessorius nerve is exposed. Now follow and mobilize the omohyoid muscle and expose the substructure of the submandibular gland. The gland is now pulled upwards until the digaster muscle is exposed. Exposure of the digaster muscle. Now insert a retractor in the caudal region. Expose the internal jugular vein. Dissect the vein from caudal to cranial, follow the outlets anteriorly, coagulate a small outlet. Now mobilize the neck preparation in level II in the anterior triangle, exposing the hypoglossal nerve and the facial artery. There is bleeding from a small branch of the facial artery, which is ligated. Separation of the anterior triangle up to the omohyoid muscle. Now evacuate level IIa. Pass the neck preparation under the accessorius and dissect caudally via levels III and IV, sparing the plexus branches of the vagus nerve and the internal carotid artery, which is exposed. Finally, check for bloodlessness, which is present. Insertion of a Redon drainage and two-layer wound closure. At the same time, the radial artery graft is lifted from the arm. The extent of the visible tumor was measured to be 8 x 6 cm. A buffer with a final graft size of 12 x 8 cm is also lifted from the forearm. For this purpose, the graft is marked, the graft is cut around and the skin is incised in the proximal forearm area. Exposure of the vein star. The second concomitant vein of the flap stalk has no contact with the superficial system or the venous confluence. The first concomitant vein opens into the venous confluence. Then lift the radialis graft, exposing the brachioradialis muscle of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve, the radial artery and lift the graft from the tendon bed and dissect the pedicle in the usual manner. Deposition of the graft in the usual manner and closure of the forearm with split skin from the thigh. The frozen section still showed carcinoma in situ with microinvasion in the marginal samples, therefore <CLINICIAN_NAME> resected 3 more times and the 2nd resection also showed carcinoma in situ with microinvasion, the third resection was taken in the area of the vallecula and sent for final histology. In the end, the resection significantly enlarged the defect so that the graft could only be sutured in under tension and with difficulty. The anastomosis was then performed using the facial artery. The facial artery is altered like a plaque and the endothelium has already detached over a long distance within the vessel. Therefore, 2 suture attempts were necessary to connect the radial artery with the facial artery. Two veins were couplers, one directly from the concomitant vein with an outlet from the internal jugular vein and then two outlets from the venous confluence with two outlets from the facial vein. At the end, insertion of a Redon drainage (Jackson type) and two-layer wound closure and insertion of an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube. Inspection of the oral cavity and the graft. The graft shows a good blood supply (random sample). Prior to the tumor resection, a PEG was inserted using the thread pull-through method without any problems.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Flap coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy, PEG placement

Here, a tumor originating from the left piriform sinus, which also affects the lateral larynx, can be seen when the larynx is adjusted. Tumor resection alone without removal of the larynx would result in a hypopharyngeal defect that would have to be reconstructed, whereby the reconstruction would extend to the entrance to the larynx with corresponding negative consequences for swallowing ability. The decision was therefore made to perform a total laryngectomy including the left piriform sinus. Subsequent sterile washing and draping. Creation of the apron flap and preparation upwards. Perform the tracheostomy in the area of the 3rd tracheal clasp. Then start with the neck dissection on the left side. The large metastases can be seen here, which safely infiltrate the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein. The lymph node package is first removed from the cranial side along the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. The resection also includes the caudal part of the parotid gland after exposure of the ramus marginalis mandibulae at its crossing point via the facial vessels. This allows the tumor block to be initially mobilized from the cranial side. Expose the very small internal jugular vein at the base of the skull. Then remove the sternocleidomastoid muscle from its origin at the mastoid. Now skeletonize the cervical vascular nerve sheath starting caudally. The entire length of the common carotid artery, including the carotid bifurcation and the internal carotid artery, can be exposed and mobilized from the tumor masses. The facial artery and the pharyngeal artery must be removed for tumor removal. The vagus nerve remains intact and runs slightly dorsal to the artery. The internal jugular vein is then also exposed caudally, which is removed just above its inflow into the subclavian vein. Resection of the lymph node conglomerate including the muscle then begins. The accessory nerve cannot be saved either. However, the hypoglossal nerve can still be dissected free in a healthy layer and left in place. The lymph node package is thus developed successively from cranial to caudal. Behind the large, easily palpable tumor masses, smaller, coarse lymph node metastases are repeatedly palpated, all of which are also removed. The cervical plexus is completely resected. The phrenic nerve is then exposed and preserved. The resection extends dorsally almost to the scapula, exposing and preserving the brachial plexus. Caudally, the metastasis extends below the clavicle and is dissected free along the subclavian vein. The thoracic duct on the right side at the caudal pole of the huge metastasis is also exposed and opened. This is then ligated at both ends so that there is no more intraoperative chyle leakage. The remaining lymph node metastases that have submerged behind the clavicles are then also removed en bloc, so that a huge lymph node conglomerate is removed from the left neck together with the surrounding fatty tissue. Subsequent removal of the constrictor pharyngis muscle from the lateral thyroid cartilage. Push the thyroid gland laterally, pass under the isthmus and ligate it. Separation of the hyoid bone from its cranial muscle attachments. Minor release of the piriform sinus on the left side. Subsequent evacuation of regions Ia and Ib, including the submandibular gland on the left side. Then transition to neck dissection on the opposite side. Here too, regions I-V are evacuated while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. The thyroid gland is then detached from the larynx and lateralized. Separation of the ansa of the constrictor pharyngis muscle from the laryngeal skeleton and complete release of the piriform sinus. Now remove the larynx caudally under the cricoid cartilage and dissect a caudally pedicled mucosal flap from the inside of the cricoid cartilage plate. This is then used in the usual way to cover the tracheal chimney above. Now dissect the lingual side of the epiglottis up to its upper edge. There, open the pharynx and release the larynx, initially on the right side along the epiglottis and the aryepiglottic fold. This provides an increasing view of the tumor of the left piriform sinus. This is then resected at a safety distance of 1.5 cm together with the laryngeal preparation so that the larynx can finally be completely removed. Removal of frozen section histologies around the now existing hypopharyngeal defect. These all proved to be tumor-free. The myotomy of the constrictor pharyngeal muscle is then performed. Implantation of the voice prosthesis through a Blom-Singer puncture. Suturing of the neopharynx with a continuous Conley suture and a second layer of single button sutures. Placement of Redon suction drains on both sides. Folding back the apron flap and completing the mucocutaneous anastomosis of the tracheostoma. Sterile wound dressing. End of the operation, handover of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy for hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the left side. Intraoperative extensive left cervical lymph node metastases, which led to a radical neck dissection on the left side, functional neck dissection of regions I-V on the right, primary voice rehabilitation by Blom-Singer puncture. Implantation of a voice prosthesis after myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle and installation of a tracheal chimney according to Herrmann.","LE (Laryngo-esophagectomy), Partial pharyngeal resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Voice prosthesis

This is located at the posterior base of the tongue, base of the tongue, glossoalveolar groove and tonsil lobe. Therefore, the above mentioned surgery is indicated. Squamous cell carcinoma G3.","First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The exophytic tumor is seen, which is located at the posterior edge of the tongue, infiltrates the base of the tongue and extends via the glossoalveolar groove into the tonsillar lobe in the anterior region. This confirms the spread of the tumor and the indication for resection, with flap coverage if necessary. This is followed by transoral resection of the tumor, taking into account the macroscopically visible borders and also the palpatorily recognizable borders. Incision around the tumor with a safety margin of 1 to 1.5 cm on all sides. The posterior area of the tongue up to the middle, including the base of the tongue, the mucosa up to the tonsil lobe over the glossotonsillar groove, the anterior area of the palatal arch. The resection extends caudally to the entrance to the hypopharynx. The preparation is thread-marked and sent for frozen section examination. No evidence of tumor in the entire margin of the specimen, even basally, thus R0 resection. Due to the extent of the defect, flap coverage is indicated in any case. The lingual nerve had to be sharply dissected away from the tumor. The PEG is now placed: pre-splinting through the esophagus into the stomach. Here, after establishing spontaneous diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Subsequent repositioning for neck dissection: skin disinfection and injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. Sterile draping. Skin incision first on the left in the typical manner. Depiction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Depiction of the omohyoid muscle. A lymph node conglomerate can be seen cranially, which infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which is therefore also resected cranially. The digastric muscle is also resected as it is also included in the conglomerate. Spatial mass or lymph node conglomerate also infiltrates the internal jugular vein in the cranial region and the accessorius nerve, both of which must be resected. The internal and external carotid arteries as well as the superior thyroid artery, facial artery and lingual artery can be visualized and preserved. The vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve, which can be dissected away from the tumor conglomerate, can also be preserved. This results in the removal of level II to V with exposure of the branches of the cervical plexus. The submandibular gland is also removed. A wide tunnel is then created enorally to allow the pedicle to pass through. Neck dissection on the right side. Skin incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure and ligation of the external jugular vein. Exposure and sparing of the auricular nerve. Exposure of the digaster muscle and the cranial accessorius nerve as well as the caudal omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the capsule of the submandibular gland and the hypoglossal nerve. Subsequent exposure of the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial and complete dissection of the cervical vascular sheath from the multiple suspected metastases in the right anterior neck preparation, particularly in levels II and III. Repeated hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. The multiple cervical metastases on the right side were completely removed while sparing the plexus branches, the accessorius nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. Dry conditions. A complete removal of levels I b, II, III, IV and V was performed, leaving the submandibular gland intact. Wound irrigation with hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Now proceed to tracheotomy: skin incision a total of 5 cm horizontally below the cricoid cartilage and sharp cutting of the skin and subcutaneous tissue using a 15 mm scalpel. Further dissection in depth using pointed scissors. Jugularis anterior is identified, cut and ligated, no bleeding. Now locate the anterior neck muscles and cut through the linea alba. The musculature is pushed to the side. Further dissection in depth with identification of the thyroid gland and thyroid capsule. The isthmus is small, the gland is also relatively small. Bipolar coagulation of the isthmus and transection of the isthmus. Now identification of the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a Björk flap, for which both thyroid lobes are bluntly pushed aside and the trachea is opened using pointed scissors. Targeted bipolar coagulation. Now 3 sutures are placed caudally using Ethibond and 3 sutures cranially to ensure sufficient epithelialization. Suturing is performed without any problems. Skin suture with 4-0 Ethilon, 8-gauge cannula is inserted without any problems. Change of cannula on the 5th postoperative day and suture removal between the 7th and 10th postoperative day. Then elevation of the radial flap from the left forearm: After measuring the defect, a flap, length 10 cm, width 6 ˝ cm, is recorded according to the three-dimensional configuration. Subsequently, first ulnar subfascial elevation of the flap. Then extension of the incision curved into the olecranon. Visualization of the surface vein system with connection to the flap pedicle. Subsequent radial subfascial elevation of the flap. Exposure of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve and preservation of this as far as possible. Caudal exposure of the radial artery, which is first clamped. First expose the pedicle up to the elbow. Dissection of the pedicle also from the brachioradialis muscle distally. Then cut the radial artery and treat it using 4-0 prolene stitches. Hand always supplied with 98-100% blood after clamping of the radial artery. Subsequent lifting of the flap. Outgoing vessels are bipolarly coagulated or clipped. A total of 2 branches of the cephalic vein and a confluent vein as well as the radial artery can be dissected in the crook of the elbow. The flap is then removed. The veins are ligated or clipped. The artery is stitched with 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Flush the flap with heparin solution. The flap is then inserted into the defect and the stalk is passed through the tunnel. Suturing of the flap, initially with sutures. The flap can then be sutured into the ............................... defect, covering the entire area. The facial artery is prepared as a vascular connection. Likewise a vein that emerges from the stump of the internal jugular vein and the external jugular vein. First arterial anastomosis between the facial artery and radial artery. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. After conditioning the veins, a portion of the cephalic vein is first anastomosed with the external jugular vein using a 2.5 mm coupler. After opening the clamps, good venous flow, positive smear phenomenon. The other outgoing vein from the external jugular vein is lipped. The 2nd vein from the cephalic vein is also clipped. The confluence is prepared and anastomosed with the outlet from the internal jugular vein after conditioning the veins using a 2.0 coupler. After opening the clamps, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. Subsequent careful hemostasis and irrigation of the wound area. Wound closure on the right with insertion of a Redon drain on the left and placement of 2 flaps. Insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula and suturing of this. The skin on the forearm is primarily closed cranially and split skin taken from the thigh is sutured caudally. Mepilex is then applied and a loose pressure bandage is applied using absorbent cotton. A Kramer splint is then applied and fixed in place with an elastic bandage. Attachment of the arm. The wound on the thigh is covered with a Mepilex dressing. The procedure is completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics, which were started with Unacid, intraoperatively for 1 week. Please continue heparin perfusor, which was started intraoperatively, at 500 units per hour for 5 days. Check the vitality of the flap clinically and by Doppler. Left cervical suture marking for this purpose. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube for 10 days, then gruel or, if necessary, diet build-up.

Starting in the area of the soft palate on the right, an ulcerating, rather flat tumor is seen, which grows on the right side to the parauvular region and consumes the tonsil region. The alveolar ridge is free on palpation. The change extends over the glossotonsillar groove to the tongue, but does not infiltrate it; growth continues caudally over the lateral pharyngeal wall into the piriform sinus entrance. Here, further growth in terms of longitudinal extension, therefore a clear cT3 finding. After partial laryngectomy with residual epiglottis and tilted laryngeal skeleton, otherwise clear conditions. No evidence of laryngeal infiltration. Initially start with transoral resection. Insertion of the McIvor blade. Resection of the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1 ˝ cm. The uvula is removed in the area of the soft palate. Subtotal resection of the soft palate. Removal of the entire tonsil lobe and removal of the glossotonsillar groove. Macroscopically in sano on all sides. No evidence of basal growth in depth. Therefore, enoral sampling in the area of the soft palate and at the buccal margins. These are assessed as tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Now repositioning for transcervical implication of the resection, preoperative ycN0 neck status. Submandibular skin incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous scar plate. Careful and laborious dissection. Exposure of remnants of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Pronounced scarring and blocking. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the common carotid artery. A superior thyroid artery can no longer be visualized. Also anteriorly scarred conditions without residual neck preparation. In level III and, after exposure of the submandibular gland and the extremely scarred digastric muscle, removal of a small amount of scar and fatty tissue. These are sent as a neck resectate for definitive histology. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the lingual artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery and exposure of the superior laryngeal artery. An accessorius nerve can no longer be visualized. Now release the digastric muscle. Exposure of the hyoid. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage horn. Now entering the hyoid laterally on the right. Very thin conditions here. Direct transition from scar tissue to enoral and here already conspicuous tissue. When the pharyngotomy is widened, contact is made with the pharyngeal tumor extension in the area of the right hypopharynx. Therefore, the hyoid is now removed. Widening of the pharyngotomy. Now a good overview of the tumor. Inclusion of the vallecula, epiglottis margin and a tongue base cuff and completion of the resection area towards the glossotonsillar groove. Now resect the pharynx to just before the middle of the hypopharynx and connect the resection area to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Now continue to expose the carotid artery and remove the entire soft tissue block subcutaneously. The tumor is now completely resected. In the area of the tumor injury during the pharyngotomy, the tumor was removed in a circumscribed and controlled manner for a better overview. Except for the caudal tumor cone, the R2 situation is marked here. Complete control of the basal tissue by exposing the common carotid artery and including the hyoid as well as the thyroid cartilage horn on the right. Inclusion of the entire tissue block. Cut around the residual tumor cone, which is located in front of the piriform sinus entrance. Finally, remove a strip of mucosa in the area of the caudal pharynx, towards the hypopharynx and the posterior pharyngeal wall, leaving a clear safety margin. All resectates are sent for frozen section diagnostics. Here, the area of the main specimen is clear except for the marked caudal margin, but with a narrow resection distance to the basal side. As already described, the entire cervical tissue was resected here. The caudal tumor cone also shows tumor-free margins in the resection area. The post-resectate is completely tumor-free. Therefore, due to the cervical resection of the wound bed or tumor bed and the free mucosal margins, a definitive R0 situation can be assumed. An approx. 2-3 mm thick vein accompanying the occipital artery was already secured in level IIa. Sufficient drainage to the mastoid was ensured. The prerequisites for a microvascular connection are therefore present. Due to the patient's slender proportions and the fresh humerus fracture, the decision was made to cover the defect using an ALT graft from the right. After marking the landmarks, doppler sonographic identification of two main peforators. Marking of a graft measuring 12 x 5.5. Medial incision. Separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the fascial plane. Exposure of the rectus femoris muscle. Clamping of the muscle cord. Subfascial dissection. Exposure of the vascular pedicle. It becomes apparent that both the ramus desendens and the ramus oblique of the lateral circumflex perforators are branching off into the graft. It was therefore decided to take both branches. Further exposure of the vascular pedicle. Visualization of the confluence of both branches. A common arterial inflow can be visualized. Visualization of the perforators, these are well developed. Complete cutting of the graft. Cut through to the fascia lata. Taking along the fascia lata and salvaging the graft while taking along a sufficiently protective muscle cuff around the perforators. Careful protection of the perforators. Isolation to the exposed artery and a strong vein and, with excellent flap perfusion, placement of the graft. Careful wound inspection, dry conditions after ligation of vascular stumps, dry conditions after wound irrigation with Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Now successive placement of 3/0 Vicryl mucosal sutures transcervically. Then pull the graft through enorally. Here, advance in the area of the posterior palatal arch or the soft palate dorsally and towards the nasopharynx. Incorporation of the graft enorally and complete suturing over the transcervically placed sutures. Finally, tight conditions. Good graft fit. Now prepare the lingual artery for vascularization. However, this is not continuous. No flow here even after shortening. Therefore clipping of the artery. Now expose the ascending pharyngeal artery. This shows a regular, good flow. Suturing conditions are now much more difficult due to the course of the vessel. Careful vessel position. Performing the vascular suture with 8/0 Ethilon. After reopening the Acland clamps, initially lack of perfusion, but excellent flow after repositioning the flap and handle. Immediate venous return and excellent flap vitality enorally. Then preparation of the occipital vein. Measurement of a 2.5 mm coupler, limited by the diameter of the occipital vein. Perform the coupler anastomosis. After reopening the clamps, immediate good perfusion of the graft and regular enoral vitality. Control of the course of the pedicle. The venous anastomosis now results in a tortuous but stable course without any significant tendency to kink. Positioning of the muscle cuff and careful, two-layer wound closure. Insertion of a flap. Control of the graft at the end of the operation. Excellent flap vitality. Transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit. A tracheotomy had already been performed previously. For this, a skin incision was made approx. 1 cm below the cricoid cartilage and a small access was made to avoid connecting the two wound cavities. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Insertion of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap. Incision of the Björk flap and the trachea. Performance of the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequent problem-free reintubation to an 8-gauge Rüsch cannula. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected ycT3 ycN0 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Postoperatively, please monitor the flap minutely. Postoperative X-ray gruel swallow on the 10th postoperative day due to pre-irradiation. After receiving the definitive histology, presentation at our interdisciplinary tumor conference to consider adjuvant therapy options.","Combined tumor resection, Defect coverage, Free flap (ALT), Right neck dissection, Tracheotomy

After panendoscopy and CT findings, spread of the oropharyngeal carcinoma from the tonsillar lobe on the left over the palatal arch to the pharyngeal side wall on the right. In this case, progression to the base of the tongue. Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery is indicated.","First, pharyngoscopy again: The tumor is seen as already described, confirming the indication for surgery. PEG has already been placed. The first step is transoral tumor resection: the tumor is removed from all sides at a distance of at least 1.5 to 2 cm. Here, parts of the pharyngeal side wall on the left and the entire palatal arch as well as parts of the pharyngeal wall on the right up to the base of the tongue, which must be resected to about 20 to 30 %. The specimen is marked using sutures. In addition, a marginal specimen in the area of the palatal arch on the left up to the tonsil lobe on the left. Both specimens are sent for frozen section. Here still in situ spurs in the area of the palatal arch to the left tonsillar lobe. However, the marginal specimen is free. Nevertheless, another resection of a small strip from the area of the palatal arch to the lower resection margin, which is also included in this marginal specimen. This specimen is also thread-marked for the frozen section. No more tumor extensions here either. Thus now R0 resection. Now extensive hemostasis. Insertion of a hydrogen swab. Transfer to neck dissection, initially on the right: curved skin incision in the typical manner. Then expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the digastric muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the infrahyoid muscles. Subsequent visualization of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein, common carotid artery, external carotid artery, internal carotid artery. Visualization of the facial vein. Exposure of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. Successive creation of a neck dissection including nodes level II to V. Branches of the cervical plexus are preserved. Subsequent left neck dissection: This is performed in the same way as on the right side. Here, however, the neck dissection is limited to levels II to IV. Here too, careful hemostasis and irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Subsequent tracheostoma creation: small Kocher collar incision. Subsequent dissection through subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature. Splitting of these. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is clamped off, severed and supplied by means of puncture ligatures. Exposure of the trachea. Creation of a broadly pedicled, modified Björk flap. Subsequent epithelialization of the Björk flap. Re-intubation and insertion of a size 8 tracheal cannula, which is fixed with sutures. Now remove the radial artery from the left forearm: Measure the required area of the flap, which is just under 15 x just under 7 cm. Mark the flap in the required size and orientation. Then cut around the flap, initially from the ulnar side. Extend the incision into the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the superficial venous system, which is included in the graft. Subsequent incision of the flap from the radial side. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. Then exposure of the radial artery. This is first clamped for 15 to 20 minutes. Subsequently, the vascular pedicle is first exposed at the top. Exposure of the connection between the superficial and deep venous system. Then again locate the radial artery. Always good saturation of the hand with 100% saturation. Deposition of the radial artery. This is treated with 4-0 Prolene stitches. Anti-shear suture in the flap area. The flap is then lifted subfascially along the flap pedicle. Outgoing vessels are treated bipolar or with clips. Dissection along the pedicle up to the olecranon. Here, after clamping and with good saturation, the interosseous artery is removed. Two branches of the superficial venous system can be dissected as connecting vessels. The deep venous system consists of very small vessels, the confluence is very thin. Finally, the flap is placed on the brachial artery, here treated with a 6-0 Vascufil suture. Deposition at the confluence with a clip. Deposition at both ends of the superficial venous system and treatment with ligatures. Flushing of the flap with heparin. Subsequent insertion of the flap into the pharyngeal defect: First create a tunnel approx. 3 transverse fingers wide through the remaining pharyngeal muscles on the right side. Then pull the stalk through. Successive suturing of the flap into the defect, which begins at the base of the tongue or at the hypopharyngeal junction and extends to the opposite tonsil lobe. Tension-free suturing using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Then vascular anastomoses in the neck area. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery and the radial artery. These are connected using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and good venous return. The veins are conditioned. Both superficial veins are connected with 2 outlets from the facial artery. The 1st with a 3.0 mm coupler, the 2nd with a 2.0 mm coupler. Good venous return can be seen here in each case, positive smear phenomenon. Good aspect of the flap now also enoral. Subsequent careful hemostasis and irrigation of both sides of the neck. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain in both sides of the neck, guided on the right. Now closure of the forearm defect: Split skin with a thickness of 0.7 to 0.8 mm is removed from the thigh area using a dermatome. This is successively incorporated into the forearm defect. The skin incision in the direction of the crook of the elbow is closed in layers. The arm is always well supplied with blood. Then bandage with hydrogel, Mepilex. Loose compresses placed on top. Wrap in absorbent cotton. Fitting of a Kramer splint, which is fixed with an elastic bandage. Finally, positioning of the arm. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is ventilated and transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Please continue antibiotics with Unacid for 1 week. Heparin perfusor, which was started intraoperatively at 500 units per hour, should be continued for 5 days postoperatively. Feeding via the previously inserted PEG tube for 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Check the flap clinically and, if necessary, by Doppler according to the scheme. Wait for the final histology. Discussion of further procedure in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Tumor resection, Neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy creation

There is now an indication for tumor resection. Primarily, a transoral attempt at laser resection is planned. If this is not possible, an external approach via a thyrofissure was also discussed with the patient. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carrying out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with anesthesia. Induction of anesthesia and transition to tracheoscopy. This turns out to be extremely difficult. With great effort, the anesthesia colleagues manage to intubate the patient using the Glidescope optics. After fixing the tube, the surgeon positions the patient. Insertion of the mouth guard. Enter with the size D small bore tube. The endolarynx cannot be adequately monitored with this. Even after several attempts, the tumor in the area of the right vocal fold cannot be adequately adjusted, so the decision is made to resect the tumor via an external approach through a thyrofissure. Removal of the small drainage tube. Repositioning of the patient. Skin spray disinfection and infiltration anesthesia. Skin wipe disinfection and sterile draping. Palpatory identification of the thyroid cartilage and the thyroid incisura. Mark the planned incision horizontally in a skin fold. Cut sharply through the cutis and subcutis. Expose the prelaryngeal musculature. Locate the midline. Lateralization of the prelarygneal musculature. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage. This dives relatively far into the depths. Therefore significantly more difficult preparation conditions. Subsequently, first incise the periosteum over the entire length of the thyroid cartilage. Subsequently, horizontal incision of the ligamentum conicum. Dissect two perichondrium flaps and lateralize them to the left and right. Subsequently, opening of the larynx in the median line in the sense of a thyrofissure using the oscillating wheel. Insertion of the three-pronged retractor. After the larynx has been opened in the median line, it can be seen that the right vocal fold is subtotally affected by the tumor. This extends from the vocal process beyond the anterior commissure to the left middle third of the vocal fold. First resection of the tumor in the area of the right vocal fold, including the ligament and the vocalis muscle. The same procedure is also carried out on the left side. Here, the ligament and the vocalis muscle are resected up to the middle third of the vocal fold. The resection margins are now inspected with the aid of the rigid endoscope. Slightly suspicious mucosal changes appear in the area of the medial surface of the arytenoid. First dissect the mucosa with the FREER. Then take circular margin samples on the right and left side ( right vocal fold margin sample cranial and caudal, left vocal fold margin sample cranial and caudal ). Since the tumor went over the anterior commissure, the periosteum in the area of the anterior commissure is now also resected. In addition, grinding of the anterior commissure of the thyroid cartilage with the diamond burr. Hemostasis is achieved by inserting a suprarenin-impregnated laryngeal swab and bipolar coagulation. During the telephone frozen section, tumor-free margin samples are found on all sides. Therefore, proceed to laryngeal closure. Creation of four drill holes in the area of the thyroid cartilage. Insertion of a 14 mm laryngeal wedge. Closure of the thyrofissure and suturing of the Keel with PDS 4-0, followed by retraction of the perichondrium flaps and complete covering of the Keel. Suture the incision in the area of the ligamentum conicum. Readaptation of the prelaryngeal muscle bellies in the median line. Additional mobilization of the lateral laryngeal bellies and medialization of the same and also fixation of the same using continuous sutures with Vicryl 4-0. Finally, insertion of a flap. Subcutaneous suture with Vicryl 4-0 and skin suture with Ethilon 5-0. Suturing of the flap. Application of a wound dressing and a compression bandage. Proceed to resection of the suspicious efflorescence in the area of the left helix. Marking of the planned incision. Spindle-shaped incision of the suspicious mass. Suture marking of the mass. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Successive mobilization of the cutis and primary wound closure following a rapid incision announcement of R0 status by telephone. Application of a wound dressing. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Completion of the operation without complications.","Partial laryngeal resection

In summary, all findings revealed a cT2 cN2c cM0 G2 tongue carcinoma on the right side. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was recommended.","After induction and intubation by the anesthesiology colleagues, the PEG is inserted first. This is done with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. Here, with excellent diaphanoscopy, the stomach is punctured without any problems. The PEG tube was then inserted using the usual thread pull-through method. The stomach and oesophagus were unremarkable. Now re-inspection of the primary tumor region. Pharyngo/laryngoscopy revealed a tumor as described above in the area of the right base of the tongue extending into the vallecula and here circumscribed to the epiglottis, tumor extension also on the right side of the pharyngeal side wall. Adjustment of the primary tumor region with the distractor. Successive resection of the primary tumor with the 5 watt CO2 laser. Resection while maintaining a safety distance of approx. 1 cm, very good microscopic control in the mucosal region, caudal resection in the area of the pharyngeal wall below the tonsillar lobe or with partial removal of the tonsillar lobe. Resection in the area of the pharynx superficially under only sparse musculature, taking the musculature up to the entrance of the piriform sinus. Separation from the base of the tongue. Here, under good depth control, complete resection with superficial removal of the right-sided base of the tongue. Resection up to the petiolus. In the area of the medial base of the tongue or towards the middle of the base of the tongue, a tumor cone appears to be pulling into the depths. Therefore, after complete mobilization of the tumour and due to the tumour mass, targeted resection is performed here. Inclusion of the lingual epiglottis surface. No cartilage infiltration here. Inclusion of the vallecula up to the opposite side. No tumor growth towards the aryepiglottic fold. The removed specimen now shows the previously described cone basally, otherwise completely healthy tissue on all sides towards the depth. Slightly narrow resection margins in the area of the vallecula after extirpation, otherwise macroscopically wide in sano resection on all sides. Post-resection is now performed in the area of the tumor cone. This is carried out far into the healthy tissue, also to widen the safety margin in the area of the vallecula. The entire tumor, both in the area of the mucosal margins and basally, is then covered with margin samples. All tumor margin samples are free of tumor and dysplasia, so that an R0 resection is achieved. A protective tracheotomy is then performed in the case of dry enoral wound conditions due to the extensive wound area. To do this, enter horizontally approx. 1 transverse finger below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Due to the position, insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring. Performing a visor tracheotomy. Incision with insertion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequent problem-free transfer to size 8 low cuff cannula. Neck dissections are then performed. Start with the right side. Submandibular incision along the skin tension lines. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid and digastric muscles. As previously described sonographically, a metastasis-suspicious mass measuring approx. 3 cm is seen in the jugulofacial angle. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with preservation of the facial vein, the superior thyroid artery and the cervical artery. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, which is very strong caudally and tapers significantly in the area of the jugulofacial angle in the area of the metastasis. Preservation of the vein. No growth beyond the capsule. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Release of the accessorius triangle and release of level V a with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Exposure and protection of the vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and all external carotid arteries. Initial exposure and protection of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Careful wound inspection. Irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Turning to the opposite side. In principle, exactly the same procedure here, after exposing the adjacent and limiting muscles, preservation of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the facial vein, the superior thyroid artery and the cervical artery. Here, too, metastasis-suspected lesion in the jugulofacial angle, here with pronounced widening of the vein. Exposure and preservation of the accessorius nerve. Dissection of the metastasis. Here, too, no growth beyond the capsule, but, as described above, pronounced tapering of the internal jugular vein, which is deposited here at this point, with outgoing vessels and vulnerability, with a cranial caliber thickness of approx. 2 mm. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and, due to the location of the metastasis, also clearing ........... Level V a's. Preservation and protection of the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve as well as all external carotid artery branches. Here too, final wound irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Finally, dry wound conditions. Insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. After applying a wound dressing, re-insertion with the small irrigation tube under dental protection to inspect the wound conditions. Circumscribed punctual monopolar hemostasis. Finally, completely dry wound conditions on all sides and completion of the procedure, after repositioning the patient, without any indication of complications. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g. Please continue this for 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT2 cN2c tongue base carcinoma on the right. After receiving the definitive histology, presentation at our interdisciplinary tumor conference to determine the adjuvant therapy procedure. Postoperatively, please feed via the inserted PEG tube for at least 5 to 7 days; if the wound is healing properly, oralization with water/tea can be attempted beforehand if necessary. Depending on swallowing function, decannulation from the 7th postoperative day.  ","Laser resection, Glossectomy, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy

The above-mentioned surgery is now indicated.,"<CLINICIAN_NAME>: PEG placement: supine position, positioning of the head. Enter with the laryngoscope blade and adjust the esophageal inlet. Then insertion of the flexible oesophagoscope and pre-scanning into the stomach. The esophagus is completely unremarkable. Further inspection of the stomach and pylorus including inversion. Unremarkable conditions on all sides. A PEG tube was then inserted using the thread pull-through method. There was a good diaphanoscopy. Tracheotomy: First injection of suprarenin/ultracaine mixture. Then sterile washing and draping. Palpation of the cricoid cartilage, thyroid cartilage and trachea. Curved skin incision between the cricoid cartilage and jugulum. Dissection in depth down to the musculature. Expose the midline and push the muscles sideways. Insertion of a retractor and exposure of the thyroid gland. This is relatively large and covered by very thick veins. Dissection of the upper and lower thyroid poles. Undermining of the thyroid gland. Then entering with Kocher clamps and clamping of the thyroid gland on both sides. Separation of the isthmus. Bipolar coagulation beforehand. Ligation of both thyroid lobes and exposure of the trachea. Now insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Pushing these tracheal cartilages apart. The creation of a Björk flap is deliberately avoided as this tracheostoma is not intended to be permanent. Epithelialization of the skin in the sense of a visor tracheostomy. Insertion of an 8 mm Woodbridge tube. Skin suture at the lateral edges. Neck dissection on the right: Curved skin incision 2 cm below the mandible and T-shaped extension on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid, this skin incision was previously discussed with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Dissection of the platysma and exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Locate and expose the omohyoid. Insertion of a retractor. Then exploration of the submandibular gland. Locate the cervical vascular sheath. Finding and exposing the accessorius nerve. Then exploration of the digaster muscle. Finding and exposing the hypoglossal nerve. Then start of neck dissection with free dissection of the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial, then transition to level IIb and clearing of this level while sparing the accessorius nerve. Then evacuation of levels III and IV while sparing the plexus branches. Level V is not evacuated. Evacuation of level IIa and level Ib as well as Ia, initially leaving the submandibular gland intact, which is later removed by <CLINICIAN_NAME> as part of the anastomosis. Exposure of all relevant vessels, external jugular vein, facial vein, superior thyroid artery, facial artery in preparation for the anastomosis. Neck dissection left: Curved skin incision 2 cm below the lower jaw, then T-shaped extension on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Separation of the platysma. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland, which is enlarged and hardened and looks tumorously altered. Involvement of <CLINICIAN_NAME> who evacuates level Ib including the submandibular gland and level Ia and creates a tunnel to the opposite side as well as an opening in the floor of the mouth enorally in order to pass the flap through here later. Now expose the internal jugular vein and locate the accessorius nerve, which is unusually deep and runs dorsal to the internal jugular vein. Clearing out levels IIb, IIa, III and IV while sparing the plexus branches. Then exposure of the vessels, external jugular vein, facial vein, superior thyroid artery. Hemostasis on both sides by means of bipolar coagulation and insertion of Redon drains. Resection of the palatal arch tumor on the right: On the anterior palatal arch with transition to the soft palate, there is a tumorous change that appears to be finely bumpy on the outside and does not infiltrate into the depths. First mark the edges of the incision with the monopolar, starting at the base of the uvula in the soft palate, past the alveolar ridge of the maxilla, taking the glossotonsillar fold with it. Now start resecting the soft palate with scissors and, if necessary, bipolar forceps. The mucosa with underlying tissue is resected without completely removing the soft palate. Then removal of the glossotonsillar fold. Removal of the tonsil and a tongue base. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. The specimen is sent to histology marked with a thread. The pathologist was also able to detect carcinoma in situ in the frozen section medially on the soft palate. Therefore, a good ˝ cm was resected here again and then a marginal sample from this area was sent laterally to the frozen section with suture marking. This frozen section of the marginal sample was then tumor-free. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation. <CLINICIAN_NAME>: First transoral tumor resection: Initial oral floor resection: positioning of the head. Insertion of the mouth retractor. Tongue tie suture. Removal of the floor of mouth tumor, which is located in the anterior floor of the mouth and extends to the alveolar ridge. The tumor is incised with a safety margin of at least 1 cm on all sides. The periosteum is pushed away from the anterior bone. The muscles of the floor of the mouth are resected anteriorly if the growth appears to be deeper. Ductus Wharton is resected anteriorly on both sides. Removal of the tumor specimen and suture marking. Small focal infiltrates in the right tumor margin and at the junction of the alveolar ridge in the frozen section. Also carcinoma in situ in the area dorsal to the tongue. Therefore, another resection of a 1 cm wide resection dorsally towards the tongue and a wide resection laterally on the right up to the alveolar ridge. Due to the tumor resection, resection of the entire alveolar mucosa in the area of the incisors and canines as well as the first anterior molar is now indicated. These teeth must therefore be removed, which is done without complications. The entire alveolar ridge mucosa is then resected over the alveolar ridge. The mucosa is sent in with suture markings remote from the tumor. Similarly, marginal samples are sent in laterally on the right and dorsally from the tongue. No more tumor in the marginal specimens, thus R0 resection in the floor of the mouth. To confirm this, the bone in the anterior area is drilled back towards the alveoli with the large diamond drill, the alveoli are also drilled out and all mucosal parts are removed or drilled out. Then resection of the palatal/oropharyngeal sidewall carcinoma on the right (already included in the dictation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>). R0 resection at the end here too. Then laser resection of the carcinoma in situ of the left pocket fold: Insertion of the size C small bore tube. Exposure of the left pocket fold. A small bumpy area can be seen in which the preliminary biopsy was probably taken. This area is cut around broadly with a safety distance using the C02 laser 3 watt continuous wave with some soft tissue basally. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section. The frozen section shows carcinoma in situ infiltrates in the center, but peripherally free, thus also an R0 situation in the laryngeal region. Overall, R0 resection in all 3 resected tumors. Neck dissection on both sides and tracheotomy now follows. (already included in the dictation of <CLINICIAN_NAME>). Subsequent removal of the radial flap: the defect in the floor of the mouth is carefully measured beforehand. A flap with a maximum length of 9.5 cm and a maximum width of 6.5 cm is created. This is measured according to the defect. The defect is marked on the forearm in the appropriate size and shape. Then apply a tourniquet. Elevation of the flap first from the ulnar, then from the radial subfascial. Incision curved towards the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the superficial venous system. Exposure of the flap pedicle and brachioradialis muscle. Successive elevation of the radial flap. Distal exposure of the radial artery, here ligation with 4-0 Prolene. Successive elevation of the flap under its pedicle, smaller, outgoing vessels are supplied bipolar or closed with clips. The ulnar, interosseous and radial arteries can be visualized in the elbow area, as can the deep venous system and the connection to the superficial venous system. There are 2 larger veins here which can be used as an anastomosis. Deposition of the flap on 2 veins and 1 artery. Very good re-perfusion after opening the tourniquet. Sufficiently long re-perfusion time. The flap is then placed on the veins and the artery. The veins are ligated and the artery is supplied with a 4-0 Prolene puncture ligature. The flap is then rinsed with heparin solution. The flap is then sutured into the defect in the floor of the mouth: a wide tunnel is created from the left, through which the stalk is passed and brought over to the right side. The flap is successively sutured into the defect according to its shape and extent. Tension-free, complete defect coverage. Flap pedicle is passed through the tunnel to the right side. The veins and the artery are conditioned here. The superior thyroid artery is selected and conditioned as the anastomotic vessel. Suture to the radial artery with 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and good venous return. Subsequent suturing of the cephalic vein to a terminal branch of the facial vein, which was previously prepared and conditioned. This is done with a size 3.5 coupler. The second venous vessel is then anastomosed to another small vein using a size 2.5 coupler. Good venous return and positive smear phenomenon in each case. Overall good flap perfusion, good arterial flow and good venous return. Careful irrigation of the wound area and hemostasis. Wound closure of each side of the neck and insertion of a Redon drain, which was fixed separately on the right side. Flap perfusion good to the end. A piece of full-thickness skin is now removed from the right groin in the typical manner. This is thinned out. After mobilization of the skin, the groin is closed in several layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. After thinning, the skin is inserted into the defect and sutured in place without tension. The cranial wound towards the elbow was closed in several layers in the typical manner. Subsequent application of a hydrogel-Mepilex dressing, loose application of compresses. Absorbent cotton dressing. Wrapping of the hand in the appropriate position on a Kramer splint using an elastic bandage. Hand is and was well supplied with blood at all times. The procedure was completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics for 1 week, which had already been started intraoperatively. Flap control for 5 days according to the scheme using Doppler and clinically. Heparin perfusor 500 units/hour for 5 days. Feeding via PEG tube for 7 to 10 days. After that, diet build-up. Radiochemotherapy appears to be indicated for a total of 3 tumors and a bilateral N+ situation. Presentation in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Resection, Neck dissection

Suspicion of tonsillar carcinoma on the left as part of the ENT mirror examination. There is now an indication for panendoscopy and histological confirmation. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.,"After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carry out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. Induction of anesthesia and transition to rigid tracheoscopy. Problem-free passage of the glottis and endotracheal entry. The mucosal conditions are inconspicuous on all sides up to the exit of the segmental bronchi. The endoscope is then removed and the patient intubated by the surgeon. Transition to esophagogastroscopy. Insertion of the endoscope under visualization and constant air insufflation into the stomach. A slightly erosively altered gastric mucosal relief can be seen here. Inspection of the corpus fundus antrum and pylorus. Entering the inversion. Inspection of the gastroesophageal junction. Here refluxy change. Desufflation slow withdrawal of the endoscope with circular inspection of all esophageal sections. There is no evidence of a synchronous second tumor. Remove the endoscope and position the patient in head reclination. Insert a compress to protect the alveolar ridge. Enter with the size C small bore tube. First, adjust the endolarynx. This is unremarkable. Then inspect the hypopharynx, the postcricoid region and the esophageal entrance. The mucosal conditions are unremarkable on all sides. The same applies to the base of the tongue. The supraglottic region as well as the oral cavity and oral vestibule. Only in the area of the left tonsil is there a superficially growing, circumscribed exophytic change extending from the middle to the caudal left tonsil pole. The borders of the tonsil are respected both by inspection and palpation. In summary, CT1- maximum CT2 tonsillar carcinoma on the left is suspected. Since the tumor is strictly limited to the tonsil, the decision is now made to perform an excision biopsy in the sense of a tumor tonsillectomy. To do this, first grasp the tonsil and medialize it. Incision of the mucosa close to the uvula, exposing the tonsil capsule. Successive dissection along the capsule in the area of the cranial part. In the middle and caudal sections, part of the palatal arch muscles of the anterior and posterior palatal arch are also resected in order to ensure a sufficient safety margin. After caudal dissection into the base of the tongue. Macroscopically, the tumor was resected in toto. Suture marking of the tumor resectate and sending for frozen section diagnostics. Cis-like changes can still be seen in the area of the anterior palatal arch. The tumor is resected again and the resectate is sent in for frozen section diagnostics. R0 situation at the end of the operation. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Dry wound conditions at the end of the operation. Final consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Removal of the mouth blocker and completion of the operation without complications. Conclusion: suspected CT1-2 tonsillar carcinoma on the left. Neck dissection on the left side and, if necessary, PEG insertion must now be planned in a two-stage procedure.","Panendoscopy, Excisional biopsy of left tonsil in the context of a tumor tonsillectomy

Described in the pre-endoscopy as a carcinoma in the oropharynx and hypopharynx. Now after interdisciplinary tumor conference above mentioned intervention indicated.,"First, pharyngo- and laryngoscopy again: The exophytic tumor is seen with deep crater formation in the area of the palatal arch up to the uvula, growth on the posterior side of the palatal arch and towards the nasopharynx, growth deep into the soft tissues towards the pharyngeal wall and mandible, growth up to the base of the tongue via the lateral oropharyngeal wall and into the hypopharynx. Larynx itself not involved by macroscopically visible tumor. Confirmation of the indication for surgery. Now PEG placement, neck dissection and tracheostoma placement. These surgical steps are dictated by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First placement of a PEG tube. This is carried out without complications using the thread pull-through method with adequate diaphanoscopy in the typical manner. A neck dissection is then performed on the right side. Creation of a skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure in the depth of the nervus accessorius, the omohyoid muscle and the posterior venter of the digaster muscle. Dissection along the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure and sparing of the vagus nerve and the common carotid artery. Removal of the neck specimen posteriorly while sparing the above-mentioned structures. Protection of the deep plexus branches. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Subsequent removal of the anterior neck preparation. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation using hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Placement of a 10 Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Now repositioning of the patient to perform a neck dissection on the left side. Creation of a skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin, the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure and dissection along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, the posterior venter of the digaster muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the capsule of the submandibular gland, which is removed in the preparation. Exposure and protection of the cervical vascular sheath. Removal of the posterior neck specimen while preserving the above-mentioned structures and the plexus branches. Removal of the anterior neck specimen. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Placement of a 10 Redon drain and two-layer wound closure and completion of the neck dissection on the left side. A tracheotomy is then performed in the typical manner. Creation of a skin incision directly below the level of the cricoid cartilage, approx. 3 cm long. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus using Pean clamps. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus and ligation of both thyroid stumps. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Creation of a tracheal incision between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasp using a scalpel. Creation of a Björk flap in the typical manner and epithelization of the tracheostoma. Reintubation to a size 8 Rügheim tracheostomy tube. Completion of the procedure without complications. Subsequent combined transcervical, transoral tumor resection: First, all vessels, internal jugular vein, internal and external carotid artery and all cranial nerves including vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and glossopharyngeal nerve are severed from the pharyngeal wall to the base of the skull and marked with vessel loops. Detachment of the tumor from the spinal column, which is successful with a blunt approach, no infiltrations visible here. Then cut around the tumor from the transoral side with a safety margin of at least 1.5 to 2 cm on all sides. The entire palatal arch falls down to the uvula, leaving the remaining palatal arch on the left. The soft palate is resected, as well as the posterior side up to the nasopharynx, taking the tube partially with it. Push off the soft tissue under control from the outside to just in front of the lower jaw. Co-resection of the pharyngeal wall and the pterygoid muscles. Detachment of the tumor also from the transoral and cranial side of the spinal column. Large parts of the posterior pharyngeal wall are also resected. The tumor is resected from the transcervical side in the tongue base area, whereby almost half of the tongue base area with vallecula and parts of the lateral epiglottis as well as parts of the hyoid bone are also resected. The resection extends into the piriform sinus and includes parts of the lateral laryngeal area including parts of the thyroid cartilage from the mucosa to the arytenoid fold. However, arytenoid cartilage is preserved. Vallecula parts are resected up to the middle. The entire specimen is removed and marked using several sutures. In addition, marginal samples are taken caudally from the posterior pharyngeal wall, from the piriform sinus up to the arytenoid fold, basally from the base of the tongue with soft tissue and mucosa, a marginal sample basally caudally, a marginal sample from the lateral epiglottis and a marginal sample from the posterior wall of the palatine arch at the transition to the nasopharynx. The specimen as a whole is in situ, as are the marginal samples, i.e. R0 situation. The defect includes the piriform sinus, lateral oropharyngeal side wall, palatal arch, posterior pharyngeal wall, base of tongue and vallecula. Defect is measured three-dimensionally. Irrigation of the wound area with H2O2 and Ringer's solution and careful hemostasis. The dimensions and size of the defect are recorded on the right forearm, flap size max. 16 cm in length and just under 10 cm in width. Now flap removal: first cut around the flap ulnarly subfascially. Extend the incision into the crook of the elbow. Subsequent exposure of the radial artery. This is initially clamped for 15 to 20 minutes. ........... Incision of the flap also from radial subfascial. Ramus cutaneus antebrachii is preserved as far as possible. The superficial venous system is exposed and also elevated. Exposure of the vascular pedicle under the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the connection between the superficial and deep venous system. Now expose the radial artery. This is relatively deep. Pulse oximeter always at 100% after clamping, no special features or abnormalities. 100% saturation even after clamping until the end of the operation. Successive lifting of the flap subfascially. Outgoing smaller vessels are clipped or bipolar coagulated. Lift the flap with the superficial vein system and pedicle up to the antecubital fossa. Two branches from the cephalic vein can be dissected here as connecting veins. The radial artery can also be dissected up to just before the brachial artery entrance. Also a venous confluence. The interosseous artery was cut and ligated. The flap was then removed. The edge of the radial antebrachial artery is treated with Prolene 4-0 puncture ligatures. The veins are ligated. Flap vessels are flushed with heparin. A piece of full-thickness skin of the appropriate size is removed from the groin. This is conditioned and incorporated into the forearm defect. The cranial defect is closed in layers. A hydrogel-Mepilex dressing and a swab dressing are applied, wrapping with sterile absorbent cotton, application of a Kramer splint and wrapping of the arm with an elastic bandage, application of the arm. Blood circulation always ensured. Now insert the flap into the defect. Gradual incorporation of the flap. The palatal arch area can be effectively replaced, as can all anatomical regions. Only in the cranial area of the posterior wall is complete defect coverage not possible, here not only a double but a triple fold would have to be made, which does not appear to be technically possible. To secure the nasopharyngeal passage, a gastric tube is inserted during flap insertion and the position is also successfully checked. Suturing is performed with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures, partly from the transoral and partly from the transcervical side, partly also after the insertion of sutures. The result is a tension-free and complete closure of the defect, whereby, as described, the most cranial parts of the posterior pharyngeal wall are not covered. There is still muscle and fascia on the spine. The vessels on the flap and in the neck area are then conditioned. The superior thyroid artery is selected, which is connected to the radial artery in 8-0 single button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. Subsequent conditioning of the veins. It can be seen that a vein can still be used at the internal jugular artery. However, it is also apparent that the internal jugular vein is partially thrombosed due to insufficient flow. Opening of the vein, thrombus can be expressed, after which flow is possible again. Due to the fact that there are no other veins left and the stalk cannot be passed through to the left side due to the shortness of the stalk relative to the required distance, the largest cephalic vein is now connected to the facial vein using a 3-0 coupler. Good flow after opening, also positive smear phenomenon. No further signs of thrombosis in the further course, so that here, with probably a lack of return flow from the cerebrum, the return flow from the flap appears to counteract further thrombosis. Other veins are clipped. Enoral flap control brings good conditions. Irrigation of the entire wound area. Careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain on both sides, guided on the right. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient transferred to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue heparin perfusor, which was started intraoperatively at 500 units per hour, for 5 days. Continue antibiotic treatment with Unacid, which was started preoperatively, for 1 week. Feeding via PEG for at least 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, slow, careful build-up of diet. Flap control according to the scheme for 5 days by means of Doppler and clinical checks. Position of the anastomosis or stalk marked with suture. Overall multistage carcinoma cT4 cN2c. Postoperative radiochemotherapy certainly indicated. Please discuss the procedure in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Resection, Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

There was also a weight loss of approx. 8 kg. Inspection revealed an exophytic mass on the left edge of the tongue, which also infiltrated the base of the tongue up to the midline on CT morphology.","Induction of anesthesia and transnasal intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. First, the PEG is inserted. To do this, enter with the flexible esophagoscope and pre-scan into the stomach. No abnormalities here with good diaphanoscopy. Insertion of the PEG using the thread pull-through method through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First, transoral tumor resection is performed after appropriate preparation. After insertion of the retractors, the tongue is disluxed and tumor resection begins with the monopolar caustic technique at an appropriate safety distance. Subsequently, marginal sections are taken from the entire circumference of the resulting defect and examined using frozen section histology, all of which prove to be tumor-free, so that an R0 resection can be assumed. Neck dissection then started on the left side: After skin incision, dissection and fixation of the skin platysma flap. Regions I-V are then removed while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. A passage is created from the transoral resection into the lateral neck. A large caliber jugular vein and the superior thyroid artery are dissected out for anasatomization. Then transition to neck dissection on the opposite side. Here too, all lymph node stations are removed while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. In the meantime, removal of the radialis graft and continuation of the operation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. <CLINICIAN_NAME> starts lifting the radialis graft from the left forearm. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle for this purpose. Exposure of the cephalic vein. Exposure of the venous star. Exposure of the venous confluence. Exposure of the radial artery at the exit from the brachial artery. Addition of <CLINICIAN_NAME> and further preparation. Incision of the graft. Exposure of the cephalic vein in the distal area. Dissection of the cephalic vein so that it is still connected to the graft with subcutaneous tissue and can be virtually integrated. Exposure of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve, which has several branches, the branches of which can be preserved. Exposure of the radial artery. Separation of the radial artery and lifting of the graft. Dissection of the pedicle up to the elbow and removal of the graft, taking superficial and deep veins with it. Closure of the arm with split skin in the usual manner using <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Suturing of the graft combined transcervically and transorally. This succeeds without any problems. <CLINICIAN_NAME> had already performed a primary suture in the area of the soft palate and the tonsil beforehand. This was completed and then the graft was sutured in place. Removal of the stalk to the left side of the neck. Anastomosis of the radial artery with the superior thyroid artery. Anastomosis of a deep vein to a branch from the facial vein close to the outlet and performance of an end-to-side anastomosis between the internal jugular vein and the point where the cephalic vein joins the venous confluence. Before the venous anastomosis, there was a very good venous return from the deep and also from the superficial system and explicitly also from the cephalic vein. Finally, positioning of the pedicle and inspection of the oral cavity. The graft is well supplied with blood. Puncture the graft, blood comes back. Palpation of the graft. The pulse of the radial artery can be felt. Please check the flap according to the usual procedure. Continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Post-operative blue swallow on the 10th day, an X-ray pre-swallow is not necessary.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, PEG placement

This was extirpated during the same session. The external pathohistologic examination revealed a metastasis of a squamous cell carcinoma. In further external diagnostics, the primary tumor in the area of the lingual epiglottis on the right could then also be verified histologically. There is now an indication for transoral resection of the tumor and neck revision on the right side. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carry out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. Induction of anesthesia and intubation of the patient. Transition to esophagogastroscopy. Insertion of the flexible endoscope under visualization and constant air insufflation into the stomach. A typical, non-irritating gastric mucosal relief is seen on all sides. Inversion and inspection of the gastroesophageal junction. This also appears unremarkable. After desufflation, slow withdrawal of the endoscope with circular inspection of all sections of the esophagus. There is no evidence of malignancy here. Remove the endoscope. Positioning of the patient in head reclination. Insertion of the mouth guard. Insertion with the size C small bore tube. First, adjust the endolarynx. This appears unremarkable. Inspection of the hypopharynx on both sides also reveals no evidence of malignancy. The tip of the piriform sinus can be freely unfolded on both sides and is lined with smooth mucosa on all sides. Postcricoid as well as in the area of the esophageal entrance are also unremarkable on all sides. The epiglottis is now adjusted. In the area of the lingual epiglottis on the right side, an area of uneven mucosa can be seen. There is no typical exophytic tumor growth here. Using the surgical microscope, it can be seen that the tumor-specific mucosal changes in the lingual epiglottis are strictly limited to the right side. The patient is now switched to a spread laryngoscope. With the addition of the support autoscope and the surgical microscope, the tumor is first cut around in a circle with the CO2 laser at a power of 5 watts. It can now be seen that the tumor is obviously infiltrating the cartilage centrally and also appears to be partially growing into the cartilage due to the cartilage fenestrations typical of the epiglottis. Hence the decision to perform a hemiepiglottiectomy. Further inspection also reveals a highly visible change in the mucosa in the area of the lateral free edge of the epiglottis up to just before the pharyngoepiglottic fold. Paramedian in the area of the plica glossoepiglottica mediana, the right part of the epiglottis is now resected up to the vallecula. Removal of a marginal sample in the area of the plica glossoepiglottica and in the area of the vallecula. In addition, removal of a marginal sample in the area of the pharyngoepiglottic fold. Sending in the tumor excidate as well as the marginal samples for frozen section diagnostics. This shows tumor-free marginal samples. Hemostasis is performed using the defocused laser and insertion of a suprarenin-soaked laryngeal swab. Subsequently, removal of the small drainage tube and the mouth guard. Repositioning for neck dissection. First, skin spray disinfection and infiltration anesthesia. Skin wipe disinfection and sterile draping. Creation of the skin incision running along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sharp cutting of the cutis as well as the subcutis. Sharp transection of the platysma. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure and ligation of the external jugular vein. Exposure and protection of the auricular nerve. Turning to the cervical vascular sheath. Here it can be seen that the cervical vascular sheath is heavily scarred due to the previous procedure. Numerous metal clips are visible. First expose the caudal border in the area of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the cranial border in the sense of the posterior digastric venter muscle. There are no scars either far cranially or far caudally. Therefore, the internal jugular vein is shown caudally first. In addition, the cranial part of the internal jugular vein is shown at the level of the digastric muscle. The accessorius nerve is also exposed. This is followed by exposure of the common carotid artery, the bifurcation and the internal and external carotid artery. Exposure of the vagus nerve and free preparation of the same from a scar block. With great effort, the lateral neck preparation can now be successively developed. Shortly below the vein angle, a massive block of scar tissue is revealed with nodules inside, which can be identified by palpation. Successive detachment of the scar block from the internal jugular vein. This results in a tear of a larger outlet. As the vein was secured both cranially and caudally using vessel loops, the bleeding can be easily controlled. Clamping out the slit-shaped defect and suturing it over with Vascufil. A Tachosil fleece is also applied. Subsequently, successive development of the lateral neck preparation via levels II b, II a, III and IV. Then turn to the median neck preparation. First expose the hypoglossal nerve. Neurolysis of the same. Exposure and ligation of the facial vein, which is also largely fixed in a scar block. Then development of the median neck preparation and wound irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Insertion of a 10 Redon drain. Subcutaneous suture with Vicryl 4.0 and skin suture with Ethilon 5.0. Application of a wound dressing. Final inspection of the laryngeal wound bed. There is no evidence of further bleeding.

In this regard, a tracheotomy was performed in an emergency <2013>. At our interdisciplinary tumor conference, it was decided to perform a laryngectomy with neck dissection on both sides. Therefore indication for the above procedure.","After induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues through the tracheostoma already in place, first renewed laryngoscopy and confirmation of tumor extension. Then infiltration anesthesia. Sterile wiping, draping. Curved skin incision that includes the old tracheostoma. Creation of an apron flap strictly subplatysmal. This works very well. First start with the neck dissection on the right side. Further dissection of the sternocleidomastoid anterior edge. Dissection along the muscle up to the posterior edge. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the accessorius nerve. These leading structures are spared during the entire operation. Exposure and dissection along the internal jugular vein and the facial vein. The structures are spared. Multiple lymph nodes are already present in this area, all of which are removed. After mobilization and exposure of the cervical vascular sheath with carotid and vagus, development of the lateral neck preparation. This is very successful. All plexus branches are spared. Now further dissect and develop the anterior neck preparation, including the capsule of the submandibular vein. Expose and protect the hypoglossal nerve and the digastric muscle. Bipolar hemostasis. Neck dissection on the left is performed in the same way. Here too, all important structures such as the internal jugular vein, facial vein, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve and the cervical vascular sheath are exposed and spared. Dissection of the hyoid bone with dissection of the infrahyoid and suprahyoid muscles. Mobilization and retraction of the thyroid gland from the trachea. Successive skeletonization of the laryngeal skeleton and detachment of the prelaryngeal musculature. Exposure of the cornu majus on both sides. Careful, blunt dissection of the pharyngeal tube from the inner sides of the thyroid cartilage on both sides. Further inspection reveals that the tumor is growing into the soft tissue in the area of the hyoid bone on the right side. Entering the pharyngeal tube suprahyoidally. Inspection of the tumor. Here it can be seen that the tumor is occupying the entire laryngeal lumen and appears to be growing submucosally on the right side into the base of the tongue. A generous resection is now performed macroscopically far into the healthy tissue. Ultimately, the complete laryngeal preparation with the tumor can be pushed caudally. Separation of the esophagus from the trachea. The trachea is finally removed at the level of the previously created tracheostoma. This preparation is now sent for final histology. Generous marginal samples are taken from strategically important points and from the base of the tongue, parapharyngeal area on the right and suprahyoidal area on the right side. These are sent for frozen section and are found to be tumor-free on all sides. Careful pharyngeal suturing is now performed, paying particular attention to tension-free adaptation in the area of the base of the tongue. Multi-layer pharyngeal suture. Adaptation of the former prelaryngeal musculature over the pharyngeal suture. Overall, this results in at least three to four layers of closure in this area. Prior to this, a Provox prosthesis was inserted in the typical manner by the phoniatrics colleagues. Insertion of two Redon drains. Pushing back the apron flap. Readaptation in the area of the tracheostoma. Further two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure bandage. Completion of the procedure without complications. Conclusion: Overall laryngectomy with neck dissection on both sides and placement of a Provox prosthesis for T4 supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma. X-ray pre-swallow recommended in 7-10 days, if the findings are normal, slow diet build-up. Further procedure depending on the histology at our interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy

The above-mentioned surgery was therefore indicated.","Total cT3 tumor. Midline of the tongue reached, but not crossed. Repeated pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy as well as oral cavity inspection: confirmation of tumor extension. Correspondingly, another CT assessment. PEG placement is now performed first: insertion with the esophagoscope through the esophagus into the stomach. After establishing spontaneous diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube without any problems. Fixation to the abdominal wall. Then tumor resection: Start with transoral resection: visualization of the tumor. The tumor is incised macroscopically and palpated on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1-1.5 cm. The posterior 2/3 of the tongue is removed up to above the midline, in the tongue base area about half of the tongue base is removed. In the floor of the mouth, removal of all soft tissue up to the lower jaw including the lingual nerve. Glossoalveolar groove and tonsil are resected together with parts of the pharyngeal side wall, caudal to it. As the overview of the soft tissue extension dorso-caudally below the mandible is not quite sufficient, the decision was made to complete the resection from transcervical to neck dissection. Therefore, repositioning to complete the tumor resection and neck dissection on both sides. Injection of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into each side of the neck. Marking of the required tracheostomy. Start with neck dissection on the left: Skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of digastric muscle, omohyoid muscle and infrahoyidal muscles. Exposure of the submandibular gland, which is initially left in place. Evacuation of level II-V. Internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, internal jugular vein, facial vein and external jugular vein are exposed and preserved. The accessorius, hypoglossal and vagus nerves and the branches of the cervical plexus are also preserved. This results in a level II to V neck dissection. Subsequent completion of the tumor resection. For this purpose, the digastric and styloid muscles are severed. Dissection of the submandibular gland. This is removed with all attached soft tissue en bloc with the soft tissue in connection with the inner tumor preparation and pulled through transorally. The tumor preparation is thread-marked and sent for frozen section. All tumor margins free in the specimen. In the dorso-basal area at the transition from the body of the tongue to the base of the tongue, removal of the tumor bordering on the resection margins, therefore another slice of soft tissue is removed from this area, which is then sent for final diagnosis. Overall R0 situation. This is followed by neck dissection on the right side: This is performed by A. Dittberner. Evacuation of levels II to IV in a typical manner with exposure of the internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, superior thyroid artery. V. jugularis interna, externa. V. jugularis cannot be preserved due to a tear and is ligated. Exposure of the vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve as well as the branches of the cervical plexus, all structures are preserved. This results in evacuation of levels II to IV. Cranially, the submandibular gland is exposed and preserved. Subsequent tracheostoma creation: small Kocher collar incision, exposure of subcutaneous tissue, platysma. Dissection through the infrahyoid muscles after spreading them in the linea alba. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped off, severed and supplied by means of puncture ligatures. Exposure of the trachea. Creation of a broadly pedicled Björk flap. This is epithelized in the typical manner. Re-intubation and insertion of a laryngectomy tube. Subsequent irrigation of all wound areas with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Removal of the forearm flap: measurement of the demissions results in a flap length of 11-12 cm and a width of up to 7 cm. The flap is marked on the forearm in the required size and shape. First cut around the flap from the ulnar side. Extension of the incision into the crook of the elbow. Depiction of the superficial venous system. Incision of the flap from the radial side. Lifting of the flap from ulnar and radial subfascial. Distal clamping of the radial artery. Exposure of the pedicle with the radial artery and radial vein. Dissection up to the olecranon. Exposure of the connection between the superficial and deep venous system. Two outlets from the area of the cephalic vein can be visualized. An acceptable confluence in the area of the radial vein. The radial artery is then removed. This is treated with puncture ligatures 4-0 Prolene. Lift the flap subfascially along the pedicle, smaller branches are coagulated or glued bipolarly. Dissection up to the antecubital fossa. The interosseous artery is clamped for 10 minutes. Here too, as before clamping the radial artery, constant saturation above 100 %. Disconnect the interosseous artery. Then remove the flap. The brachial artery is treated with 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Here too, saturation at 100 %. The veins are clamped and ligated. Flap is removed and flushed with heparin solution. After careful hemostasis, the proximal part of the forearm is closed in layers. The forearm defect is covered with thick split skin 0.7-0.8 mm. For this purpose, split skin is removed from the right thigh with the dermatome. Suture the split skin into the forearm defect. Thigh is treated with hydrogel dressing. The forearm is treated with ..............-Mepilex dressing, with a loose swab dressing on top, which is modeled using absorbent cotton. Fitting of a cramp splint. This is loosely fixed with a tape bandage. Positioning of the arm. Subsequent suturing of the radial flap into the defect: After partial suturing, the flap is gradually worked into the defect. Tension-free suturing of the flap is achieved. The stem is inserted through the large tunnel into the soft tissues of the neck. Complete tension-free defect coverage. Vessels are conditioned. The radial artery is sutured to the superior thyroid artery after conditioning. For this purpose, fish-mouth-like dilation of the superior thyroid artery. Suture with Ethilon 9-0 sutures. After opening the previously inserted clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. Both outlets of the cephalic vein are conditioned for the anastomosis. One outlet is anastomosed with an outlet from the facial vein after conditioning using a 2.5 mm coupler. After opening the clamp, there is no venous return. Positive smear phenomenon. The other outlet from the cephalic vein is anastomosed after conditioning with the external jugular vein using a 3.5 mm coupler. Here too, after opening the clamp, reflux without any problems, positive smear phenomenon. Subsequent clipping of the still open confluence. Irrigation of the entire neck area and careful hemostasis. Layered wound closure on the right with insertion of a Redon drain. Layered wound closure on the left with insertion of 2 flaps. Insertion of a tracheostomy tube, which is fixed with sutures. Tracheal cannula with size 8. Repeated inspection of the flap. This is vital. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient has received Unacid several times intraoperatively. Please continue this antibiotic treatment for one week. Patient goes to intensive care unit for monitoring. Please elevate the patient's upper body. Flap control according to the scheme, clinically if necessary also with Doppler sonography control. Continue heparin which was started intraoperatively at 500 E/h for 5 days. Nutrition via the PEG tube. After 7-10 days, if necessary, swallow porridge and then build up diet. Post-ventilation for one night. Overall cT3 oral floor oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left.

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the indication for primary surgery was given.","After an introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleagues, preparation by the anesthesia colleagues and positioning of the patient. The primary tumor is inspected first. This is done with the small bore tube under dental protection. There is a rough mass in the right tonsil lobe extending submucosally into the soft palate. On palpation, it clearly extends laterally towards the soft tissue of the neck and clearly exceeds the caudal border of the tonsillar lobe. Growth into the glosso tonsillar groove, but no tongue infiltration. The tumor extends submucosally to the mandible, but clearly does not infiltrate it. The PEG is now inserted. This is done with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy advancement into the stomach. Excellent diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. Inconspicuous oesophagus on reflection. After positioning the patient, injection of xylocaine with adrenaline additive cervically due to lateral growth, primarily transcervical procedure to secure the cervical vascular sheath. For this purpose, a skin incision is made at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the skin and subcutaneous tissue are cut, the platysma is cut, the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle are exposed. First expose and clear the anterior neck preparation and preserve the superior thyroid artery, the hyperglossal nerve and the cervical vein. A true facial vein is not pronounced, preservation of the extremely strong external jugular vein. Now free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Macroscopically, there are clearly conspicuous nodules in levels II and III due to their size. Anterior neurolysis of the hypergossic nerve with attached cervical vein. Reintegration of the nerve, followed by exposure of the accessorius nerve, also here neurolysis and reinsertion of the nerve. After complete exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, the vagus nerve is also exposed. This is also mobilized by neurolysis and then re-embedded. Elongated exposure of the common carotid artery, the bulb and the internal and external carotid artery. The facial vein is alloyed during subsequent dissection of the transcervical access artery, but is otherwise preserved. All carotid branches. The accessorius triangle is then dissected and level V dissected, carefully preserving the cervical plexus branches. The submandibular gladula is now released with careful protection and release of the marginal mandibular ramus, re-embedding of the nerve, separation of the gland, resection of the digastric muscle, posterior venter, removal of level I b. Here too, several nodules measuring up to 1.5 cm. The tumor can now be clearly palpated in the area of the lateral pharyngeal wall. Now combined transoral and transcervical procedure. Cut around the tumor with a visual distance of a good 1 cm. Reaching from paraovular over the soft palate up to the algular ridge and just including the lateral edge of the tongue, also resection up to the posterior floor of the mouth. It can be seen that the tumor also clearly infiltrates the posterior palatal arch including the musculature. Therefore complete involvement of the muscular posterior palatal arch. Resection down to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Macroscopic in sano resection on all sides both to the edges and clearly basally. Transcervical completion of the tumor dissection also towards the caudal pharyngeal wall. Macroscopic in sano. The tumor specimen is now sent in thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. This shows discontinuous tumor growth in the area of the lateral margin. Therefore, according to the buccal mucosa of the alveolar ridge and the posterior floor of the mouth, resection specimens are taken and imaged with new margin samples. These are finally diagnosed as tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Otherwise, all resection margins are tumor-free without high-grade dysplasia. The defect is now measured for subsequent reconstruction. First the neck dissection of the opposite side. To do this, make a skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, cut through the platysma, expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle, Release of the submandibular gland, exposure of the digastric muscle, removal of the anterior neck preparation while preserving the superior thyroid artery and then neurolysis of the hyperglossal nerve with attached cervical nerve. Re-embedding of the nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, exposure of the accessorius nerve, neurolysis of the nerve and re-embedding. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Subsequent evacuation of level V a with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. There may be a caudal indication of lymph leakage. Overall, no suspicious lymph node changes on the left side. Final wound irrigation with Ringer's solution, insertion of a 10-gauge redon drain if the wound is absolutely dry and careful two-layer wound closure. The plastic tracheostomy is then performed. Skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, expose and cut through the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus after supply. Insertion between the second and third tracheal ring. Creation of a wide-base styled PJ flap and subsequent insertion of the tracheostoma with mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequently, problem-free reintubation to a size 8 low-coff cannula. The radialis graft is then lifted from the left forearm. After marking, the 9x6 cm graft is measured with a special soft palate and mouth configuration. Cutting around the graft, exposing and taking along the cephalic vein. Exposure of the superficial ramus, radial nerve and complete preservation of the nerve. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle, transection of the vascular pedicle. Reciprocal exposure of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle, strictly subfacial release of the graft. Subsequent preparation of the pedicle, including the cephalic vein. Cubital part showing a strong vascular connection from superficial to deep venous systems. Therefore preservation of the venous bridge. Exposure and preservation of the common interosseous artery. Removal of the radial artery. After reopening the tourniquet with a vital graft and regular blood supply to the hand. Careful hemostasis. Subsequent careful two-layer wound closure. Incision of the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the right groin. Application of a vacuum dressing and positioning of the ......... in a functional position. Subsequent repositioning of the arm. For full-thickness skin harvesting from the right groin. Incision of an oval skin area measuring approx. 10x6 cm. Strictly cutaneous elevation. Careful subcutaneous mobilization, insertion of a 10-redon drain in dry wound conditions and multi-layer wound closure. Now combined transoral and transcervical graft fitting. Overall very good fit and sufficient and complete reconstruction of the defect. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery and the strong superior thyroid vein. For anastomization, perform the arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. This is successful with immediate venous return. Conditioning of the vein. Measure a size 4.0 cuppler and perform the venous anastomosis with the cuppler system. Subsequent regular graft perfusion as well as positive spreading phenomenon and regular style pulsation, so that after careful wound irrigation and inspection, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drainage and careful wound closure. The patient was then repositioned, a final consultation was held with the anesthesia colleagues and the procedure was completed with a vital graft. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with 3g Unacid. Please continue this for 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resistant at least cT2 and cN2B oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Careful postoperative flap monitoring. If the graft heals properly and the graft is intact, a gradual diet can be started from the eighth postoperative day with a good prognosis with regard to swallowing function.

On CT, extension to the lateral side, not clearly definable. Therefore patient also informed about flap coverage after tumor resection.","Initial consultation with the anesthesiologist. After preparation and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The tumor is visible, which is located in the area of the left tonsil and slightly exceeds it. However, the tumor is mobile on palpation, so that a transoral resection may be possible without flap coverage. Placement of the PEG: Entering the stomach with the flexible esophagoscope. After diaphanoscopy has been performed, a PEG tube is inserted in a typical manner without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in a typical manner. Sterile dressing. Transoral tumor resection: The tumor is macroscopically incised on all sides with an electric needle or scissors at a safety distance of 0.5 - 1 cm. A good layer is found laterally. The posterior palatal arch can be largely preserved, the anterior palatal arch is resected with parts of the adjacent fatty tissue. The resection extends caudally to the level of the epiglottis. The base of the tongue is resected only at the edges with a safety margin. The preparation is marked with a suture. A marginal sample is taken from the area of the mucosa of the posterior palatal arch from the cranial to the caudal end of the tumor. Also a marginal sample from the area from the glossoalveolar junction to the caudal pharynx via the base of the tongue. In the frozen section, tumor removed on all sides in healthy tissue, but with a very narrow safety margin of 0.2 cm in the area of the specimen. Marginal samples, which were taken separately, are free. Despite the fact that the tumor was removed from healthy tissue, further soft tissue was resected cranially and cranial-medially, but this was sent for final histology. Adaptation of the posterior palatal arch with the pharyngeal wall in the most cranial area using two sutures. Overall borderline situation with regard to flap coverage. Overall, however, flap coverage is not absolutely necessary if the posterior palatal arch is preserved. However, extensive resection in the cranial soft tissue area. Transfer to neck dissection on both sides now follows. First disinfect the skin. Injection of a total of 8 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into the sides of the neck on both sides. Subsequent cranial incision, which ends in a neck fold. Neck dissection on the left: Skin incision as described. Subsequent dissection through the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. A very small external jugular vein is ligated. N. auricularis magnus is preserved. Exposure, displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the auricularis magnus nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle and the infrahyoid muscles. Dissection of the cervical vascular sheath. A lymph node conglomerate is located on this. Clinical evidence of soft tissue infiltration. However, the lymph node conglomerate can be dissected away caudally from the submandibular gland. The same applies to the area of the internal jugular vein, which is not infiltrated. Exposure of the external/internal carotid artery, superior thyroid artery, facial artery and lingual artery. The lingual artery is ligated. Subsequent successive clearing of levels II to V. This largely preserves the branches of the cervical plexus. Exposure, relocation and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Also branches of the cervical plexus, between which the lymph nodes of level V a are removed. Irrigation of the wound area. Careful hemostasis. No evidence of bleeding, chyle flow or other complications. Layered wound closure with insertion of a Redon drain. Application of a pressure dressing. Neck dissection on the right: This is done in the same way as on the left. Level II to V are removed as described on the left side. Enlarged and suspicious lymph nodes are also found here, but not as clearly as on the right side. However, overall there were also suspicious lymph node metastases here. Also presentation, relocation and at the end of the operation re-embedding of the auricularis magnus nerve, vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Irrigation and hemostasis. Careful revision, no evidence of complications and layered wound closure with insertion of a Redon drain. Application of a pressure dressing. Tracheostoma creation: Small Kocher collar incision. Dissection through the fatty tissue to the infrahyoid musculature. Larger veins are ligated. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature, which is divided. Subsequent exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is dissected, which is successful using bipolar coagulation with a thin isthmus. Subsequent exposure of the trachea. Entering the trachea in the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Creation of a visor flap. This is epithelized using six sutures. Subsequent re-intubation. Insertion of an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube. Lateral skin areas are closed with sutures. Another enoral inspection: Here again careful hemostasis. Two ligatures were placed laterally in the area of the pharyngeal wall as part of the transoral resection. No more bleeding visible here. The procedure was then completed without complications. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist. The patient goes to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Please continue antibiotics as started intraoperatively with Unacid for a total of one week. Total cT2 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left and lymph node metastases on both sides. Left side probably with soft tissue infiltration or extracapsular infiltration, so radiochemotherapy will most likely be necessary postoperatively. Waiting for the final histology. Planning of the further procedure depending on the final histology. Food should be restored after one week at the earliest, until then nutrition via the inserted PEG.","Resection, Bilateral neck dissection, PEG placement, Tracheotomy

An exophytic mass is seen here, which extends at the level of the ascending mandible towards the last molar of the maxilla. The tumor extends caudally into the tonsillar lobe and reaches the tip of the hypopharyngeal side wall. Preliminary consultation with the anesthesiologist. The patient has already been positioned and nasotracheally intubated. Insertion of the mouth blocker. Cutting around the tumor with the electric needle. It can be seen here that the tumor extends to the gingiva of the last molar of the left maxilla. Therefore, tooth extraction in toto with all roots. The alveolus appears tumor-free. A frozen section sample is taken from the alveolar margin, which is found to be tumor-free intraoperatively. Further incision of the tumor caudally with a safety margin of about 4-5 mm. The tumor extends caudally to the lower edge of the tonsil lobe. The resection is performed on the pharyngeal musculature. The anterior palatal arch must also be resected here. The posterior palatal arch is preserved in the cranial part. Lateral exposure of pharyngeal fat, which is coagulated here but appears absolutely tumor-free. Marginal samples are also taken from this area. Border samples are also taken after complete tumor excision in the area of the anterior and posterior margin as well as the cranial and caudal margin. All margin samples are also found to be tumor-free intraoperatively in the frozen section. Subsequent subtle hemostasis. Insertion of a hydrogen-soaked swab. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection on the left side. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline. Skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Dissection in layers in depth after cutting through the platysma. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Clearing of neck dissection levels Ib to V and preservation of all branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery. Also exposing the nerve structures. In this case, long-distance exposure of the vagus nerve in the cervical vascular sheath. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve. Same procedure for the accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. The cervical profunda can also be preserved. Finally, the entire neck preparation is sent for histopathological examination. In the area of the vein angle, slightly enlarged, macroscopically rather suspicious nodules were found. The final result remains to be determined by histopathology. Dissection in the area of the hypoglossal triangle and in the area of the pharynx was carried out extremely carefully. In the end, it is apparent that there is no penetrating defect to the pharynx. Careful palpation of the pharyngeal side wall, which still appears sufficiently thick, so that the decision is now made not to perform a local reconstruction by means of tissue transfer. The pharyngeal side wall is simply tightened slightly and closed over the exposed fatty tissue as a local mucosoplasty. Insertion of a wound flap. Two-layer wound closure of the neck. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection on the right side. Here too, skin incision along the sternocleidomastoid after injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline. Layer-by-layer dissection in depth. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. This is also exposed over a long distance. Then dissection of the neck preparation of levels Ib to V. All nervous and vascular structures are also preserved here. As part of the dissection, long-distance exposure, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve at the end of the operation. Same procedure in the area of the accessorius and hypoglossal nerve. Preservation of the cervical profunda here too. Finally, subtle hemostasis and insertion of a Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Decision to insert a PEG tube due to the defect and the expected adjuvant therapy. Easy insertion into the esophagus with the flexible instrument. Visual visualization up to the stomach, where a regular fold relief is visible. Locate the diaphanoscopy and the appropriate puncture site. Then insert the PEG tube using the thread pull-through method. Positive tenting phenomenon when puncturing the abdominal wall. Aspiration of the insufflated air and reflection of the esophagus. Dressing application. Transition to tracheotomy. Due to the large wound area, after intraoperative discussion of the findings, decision to tracheotomize the patient, in the sense of a protective tracheostomy. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline in the area of the jugulum. Modified Kocher incision and layered preparation in depth. Separation of the infralaryngeal and pretracheal muscles in the midline. Exposure of the very slender thyroid isthmus. This is coagulated and cut in the middle. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp. Dissection of a Björk flap. Circular mucocutaneous anastomization of the tracheostoma.

After skin incision, preparation of the anterior tracheal wall. Opening between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp. Insertion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequent retubation of the patient. Then start with the transoral tumor resection. After exposure of the tumor, which has invaded the left posterior palatal arch and extends just to the uvula, it is resected. The resection includes the uvula on the right side and extends upwards to about 1 cm to the hard palate. The entire left soft palate is then successively removed under visualization up to the middle tonsil pole. The specimen is then sent in oriented on a cork plate for a frozen section histological examination. Here, the left margin in the area of the tonsil lobe is still affected by CIS, as is the resection margin in the area of the posterior hypopharyngeal wall. Large resections are taken, which subsequently prove to be tumor-free. Subsequently, transition to neck dissection on the left side. Here, the vascular nerve sheath of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is exposed after a skin incision and sharp transection of the platysma. Regions I-V are then removed while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. Macroscopically, cervical metastasis is often suspected. The carotid bifurcation is then completely exposed and the internal carotid artery is followed cranially to the radiologically visible metastasis on the atlas arch. After cutting the digastric muscle, also cut the stylohyoid muscle and expose the entire length of the styloid process. The metastasis is exposed craniomedially, which is successively dissected free and finally removed with complete skeletonization of the internal carotid artery up to its entry into the base of the skull. Subsequent transition to neck dissection on the right side. Here a metastasis is seen in region IIb, which has infiltrated the vein as well as the muscle and nerve. The internal jugular vein is removed caudally and the specimen is removed together with the sternocleidomastoid muscle, dissecting the accessorius nerve up to the digastric muscle. The internal jugular vein is then also ligated at the base of the skull and finally removed. The hypoglossal nerve and vagus nerve can of course be preserved. Insertion of a Redon suction drain and two-layer wound closure on the right side. Subsequent transition to the opposite side and creation of an opening in the hypopharynx in the area of the submandibular lobe after skeletonization of the hypoglossal nerve. Elevation of the radial lobe graft through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Marking of the radial artery, palpatory identification of the distal radial artery and the ulnar artery. Marking of the flap borders (7 x 3 cm) on the distal forearm proximal to the flexor retinaculum with an S-shaped incision extending proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue from the proximal side. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the graft margin. Identification of the external ramus, the superficial ramus, the radial nerve, protection of these. Exposure of the vascular pedicle between the flexor carpi radialis muscle and brachioradialis muscle, here dissection of the pedicle without damaging the vessel to be anastomosed. The incision is now made along the flap borders on the distal forearm. Elevation of the radial portion while leaving the fascia of the brachioradialis tendon intact. Subsequent dissection down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the forearm fascia of the graft edge up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendinous tissue on the flexor tendon and to protect the ulnar artery. Identification of the artery. Clamp the radial artery with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes under good pulsoxymetric oxygen saturation measured on the thumb (approx. 98 %), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation with silk thread after the flap umbrella has already been completely detached from the base. Perforators were treated with a vessel clip. Bipolar coagulation. The radial nerve in the median side of the brachioradialis muscle remains intact. The brachial artery was exposed as well as the recurrent radial artery, ulnar artery, radial artery and interosseous artery; the radial artery was removed while sparing all of the above vessels and ligated using a silk thread. Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm and defect coverage of the graft with split skin from the right thigh in a typical manner with stitching of the split skin. Application of a wound dressing, forearm splint, completion of graft elevation without complications. Subsequent insertion of the radial artery flap graft into the defect and suturing to the soft palate and the base of the tongue combined transorally and transcervically. After removal of the facial artery at the lower jaw, the arterial anastomosis is performed with the radial artery. The venous anastomosis is formed by 2 arm veins in a Wend-to-side manner to the internal jugular vein. Finally, insertion of a Redon suction drain and a drainage flap, multi-layer wound closure. Re-intubation of the patient onto an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube. Sterile wound dressing and end of the operation. Transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Resection of an oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left side with primary reconstruction using a free-stemmed radial flap from the left forearm with primary coverage of the defect on the left forearm with split skin from the right thigh. On the left side, selective neck dissection of regions I to V with removal of a metastasis in front of the atlas arch. On the right side, radical neck dissection with infiltration of the internal jugular vein, the accessorius nerve and the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

Due to the extremely poor adjustability, the indication for a partial laryngectomy from the outside was given.","After an introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleagues, initially no infiltration of local anesthetic with adrenaline. Zigzag incision prelaryngeal. Dissection in layers down to the prelaryngeal musculature. Cut off several large veins here. Then separate the prelaryngeal musculature in the midline and dissect the thyroid cartilage. Exposure of the ligamentum conicum and the cricoid cartilage. Subsequent exposure of the thyroid isthmus, which is undermined and dissected after coagulation. Then expose the anterior surface of the trachea. Then incision of the perichondrium on the thyroid cartilage. This is then pushed off to the right and left. Then open the thyroid cartilage with the wheel in the midline. Transverse incision of the ligamentum conicum. Then insertion of retractors into the outer edge of the wound and into the thyrofissure. An exophytic mass is now visible, which extends into the anterior commissure. The endolarynx was opened paramedially on the right side. Now take a marginal sample in the area of the anterior commissure on the right side, where there is no longer a tumor macroscopically. The tumor is then dissected out at the level of the ligament and in the area of the subglottis from front to back. The endolaryngeal musculature lateral to the vocal cord does not appear to be infiltrated by the tumor. This boundary is therefore respected as the resection boundary. The resection is performed up to the base of the vocal process, where the tumor ends in the area of the posterior commissure. This is followed by careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation and application of Otriven swabs. Further marginal samples are then taken from the cranial, caudal and dorsal margins and the basal area of deposition. All marginal samples are diagnosed intraoperatively as tumor-free in the frozen section. Therefore, an R0 resection of the specimen can be assumed. Careful hemostasis is performed again. The anterior surface of the trachea is then exposed again. Now incision of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp. The 3rd cartilage clasp is then removed as the cartilage here is very fragile. Creation of a tracheostoma with the chondrotome. The tracheostoma is then sutured circularly to the skin. Due to the depth and the short neck, the entire preparation is considerably more difficult. The patient had to be intubated and extubated several times during the creation of the tracheostoma. Finally, the thyrofissure was sutured after 4 drill holes were made in the area of the thyroid cartilage. Insertion of a laryngeal keel, which was also fixed with 2 sutures. Then suture of the conic ligament. Now move several muscle layers over the thyroid cartilage, which are also sutured in the midline. Beforehand, insert a wound flap that extends to the keel. Then two-layer wound closure and application of a pressure bandage. At the end of the operation, the patient is then intubated with an 8 mm tracheoflex tracheostomy tube. The procedure is then completed after a final consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. After waking up without any problems, the patient is then transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring.","Chordectomy through thyrotomy

Histologically confirmed to be a squamous cell carcinoma.","Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Initial adjustment with the small bore tube. Attempt to expose this tumor for laser resection. It turns out that due to the size of the tumor and the difficulty of exposure, it is not possible to resect the tumor in this way. As a result, the decision was made to proceed externally. Repositioning of the patient. Insertion of a gastric tube. Abjuring and covering the neck after local anesthesia has been administered prelaryngeally. Transverse skin incision in a skin fold. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the linea alba. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage and ligamentum conicum. Coagulation of the cricothyroid artery. Separation of the conic ligament. Opening of the thyroid cartilage in the median line with the wheel. The tumor can be seen in the area of the right vocal fold, which extends to the anterior commissure; suspicious tissue also extends to the left commissure, which is first removed completely so that the left vocal fold is visible. This tissue is sent for a frozen section examination and is assessed as tumor-free. Before opening the larynx, a small lump was removed above the ligamentum conicum. This was the delphic lymph node. This was also sent for a frozen section examination and was also tumor-free. Removal of the perichondrium in the area of the thyroid cartilage on the right front. Careful resection of the tumor. As far as can be assessed intraoperatively in healthy tissue. The resection includes the morgue sinus, the subglottic slope and also includes the tip of the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage. As far as can be assessed intraoperatively, the resection of the tumor is complete. Prior to resection, fluid was injected into the tissue surrounding the tumor in order to lift the tumor from the base. Careful hemostasis. Removal of representative margin samples at all levels. These marginal samples are all found to be tumor-free. Closure of the larynx with three Vicryl sutures after careful hemostasis. Rinsing with water and hydrogen. Reconstruction of the ligamentum conicum. Closure of the infrahyoid muscles above the thyroid cartilage. Insertion of a flap. Wound closure in layers. Application of a pressure dressing.

Unobtrusive conditions in the area of the trachea up to the carina. Subsequently, difficult endotracheal intubation and positioning of the patient by the surgeon due to the very narrow endolaryngeal conditions. Flexible endoscopy of the oesophagus and stomach. Advance the endoscope to the stomach. Inconspicuous conditions up to the pylorus. Endoscope inversion and inspection of the esophagogastric junction. Inconspicuous conditions there. Withdrawal of the endoscope and inspection of the esophagus. Inconspicuous conditions there. A laryngoscopy was then performed using a Kleinsasser C-tube. This revealed a circularly growing glottic laryngeal carcinoma extending to the arytenoid region on both sides and into the anterior commissure with slight spread into the subglottis without infiltration of the supraglottis. Otherwise, the piriform sinuses on both sides, the posterior hypopharyngeal wall and the postcricoid region as well as the esophageal inlet were unremarkable. The posterior wall of the oropharynx and the lateral walls were endoscopically unremarkable. The base of the tongue was unremarkable on endoscopy and palpation. Thus, and taking into account the clinical findings (SL arrest on the left and SL immobility on the right), the indication for complete laryngectomy and neck dissection on both sides was determined. Application of local anesthesia cervically on both sides and medially. Skin ablation and sterile draping. Creation of a subplatysmal apron flap in the typical manner. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and thyroid isthmus, undermining of the same, exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea and incision between the 3rd and 4th tracheal cartilage clasp. Fixation of the tracheal margin at the skin edge and reintubation on a size 8 laryngectomy tube. Subsequent dissection along the anterior sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side. Exposure of the capsule of the submandibular gland, exposure of the accessorius nerve and the digaster muscle (venter posterior). Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and exposure of the cervical vascular sheath from caudal to cranial, successive dissection along the cervical vascular sheath while protecting it and the plexus branches. Removal of the posterior and anterior neck specimen while protecting the above-mentioned structures. Hemostasis there using bipolar coagulation. Dry conditions. Repositioning of the patient to perform a neck dissection on the left side. Dissection along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the left side. Exposure of the accessorius nerve in depth. Exposure of the posterior venter of the digaster muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection along the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial. Successive removal of the posterior and anterior neck preparation while protecting the above-mentioned structures and the plexus branches. Hemostasis there using bipolar coagulation and subsequent concentration in the cervical median area. Separation of the prelaryngeal muscles in the midline. Exposure of multiple, conspicuous nodes in region VI. These are then removed and sent for final histology. The prelaryngeal musculature is then cut at the level of the hyoid bone using a monopolar knife. Exposure of the epiglottis after transection of the hyoepiglottic ligament. Exposure of the free edge of the epiglottis. Opening of the pharyngeal lumen and downward retraction of the epiglottis with the hyoid bone. Mucosal incision along the free epiglottis edges and the aryepiglottic folds on both sides. Followed by a scalpel incision along the posterior edge of the thyroid cartilage on both sides. Subperichondral preparation and protection of the piriform sinuses on both sides. Subsequently, union of both vertical mucosal incisions in the area of the plica aryepiglottica on both sides in the postcricoid area. Further submucosal dissection while sparing the mucosa and the submucosa of the anterior esophageal wall. Further dissection between the trachea and esophagus. Dissection at this level and placement of the laryngectomy specimen between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasp. Two marginal samples (tracheal resection margin, anterior wall of the left piriform sinus) were sent for frozen section - both were found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleagues. Subsequently, paramedian myotomy of the cricopharyngeal muscle on the left side and partial resection of the caudal part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides. Subsequently, a size 10 Provox-Vega was placed retrograde without any problems, followed by a four-layer pharyngeal suture (mucosa, submucosa, pharyngeal muscle layer, infrahyoid muscles). This results in complete pharyngeal closure. Subsequently, to secure the pharyngeal suture, insertion of cut pieces of TachoSil along the entire pharyngeal suture. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Knock back the subplatysmal apron flap and fix its caudal edge to the tracheostoma. Platysma suture. Single button skin suture. Application of a pressure bandage and completion of the procedure without complications. Please provide nutrition via the inserted nasogastric feeding tube for the next 12 days and then perform X-ray gavage.

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment was recommended. Immediately preoperatively, sonography revealed a cN0 neck status. CT showed no evidence of distant metastasis. In the case of a preoperatively determined implant fracture following cervical spine surgery, the procedure regarding positioning was discussed with the trauma surgery and neurosurgery colleagues on several occasions. Positioning within the natural range of motion was classified as safe.","After preparing and positioning the patient, the PEG is first inserted. Insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-laryngoscopy into the stomach. Excellent diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. Then careful positioning with moderate hyperextension, starting with transoral tumor resection. First perform pharyngoscopy. An exophytic, exulcerous tumor is seen in the right paramedian soft palate. This infiltrates the soft palate completely. Only small remnants on the left side, growth into the soft palate dorsally. However, no dorsal mucosal perforation. On the right side, circumscribed infiltration of the upper tonsil pole and the posterior palatal arch. Otherwise, no further extension by palpation and inspection. The tumor is now resected with a macroscopic safety margin of approx. 1.5 cm. Resection of the tumor macroscopically clearly in toto. When releasing the soft palate, good control of the posterior surface is also possible, here too maintaining the safety distance. Isolation to the upper tonsil pole, subtotal removal of the anterior palatal arch. Partial resection of the posterior palatal arch. This safely resects the carcinoma. If the upper pole of the tonsil is infiltrated, the tonsillectomy is performed using the classic dissection technique. Removal of the tonsil at the lower tonsil pole. Certainly no tumor growth here. The tumor is sent as a thread-marked specimen for frozen section diagnostics and is diagnosed here as a squamous cell carcinoma resected in sano. The result was an almost total soft palate defect with a defect in the area of the tonsil lobe, therefore a graft defect measuring up to 10 x 6 cm was measured. Multiple checks and, in the event of blood dryness, initially turning to neck dissection on the left side. A very short neck is seen. Difficult visualization conditions due to lack of hyperextensibility with short anatomical relationships. Skin incision submandibularly and at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure and later ligation of the external jugular vein with a very oblique course. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical artery, the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. Careful free preparation. Level 2 shows a slightly enlarged but non-adherent lymph node measuring approx. 2 x 1 cm in the area of the jugulo-facial angle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Evacuation of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and evacuation of level 5 with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches and caudal protection of the lymph vessel structures. Final inspection. In dry conditions after resection of the neck dissection en bloc. In dry conditions, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Repositioning and parallel neck dissection of the right side and elevation of the radialis graft from the left forearm. First turn to the neck dissection. Correspondingly to the opposite side, make the skin incision. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of a distal part of the strong external jugular vein, which tapers significantly towards the submandibular region. Preservation of the vessel. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. The anterior region shows clear scarring in this case following transcervical cervical spine surgery. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of a deep facial vein branch. Exposure of the very slender superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and the cervical artery. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Several macroscopically enlarged lymph nodes are visible in levels 2 and 3. Also non-adherent visualization of the accessorius nerve. Release of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and release of level 5 with careful protection of the cervical plexus structures. Overall, difficult preparation conditions on both sides due to the anatomical conditions and the difficult positioning. After careful inspection with dry wound conditions, the digastric muscle is resected. Exposure of the carotid bulb and the division of the carotid artery. Exposure of the external carotid artery with the superior thyroid artery, facial artery and occipital artery. Cranial dissection along the artery. Exposure of the styloid under enoral inspection. Performing the pharyngotomy in the area of the tonsil lobe on the right. Widening of the pharyngotomy under control of the vascular nerve structures. However, creation of a tunnel a good two transverse fingers wide. Subsequent insertion of the radialis graft without any problems. To lift the radialis graft. After marking the graft with a special soft palate configuration. Perform the tourniquet. Cut around the graft. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle, a right constant cephalic vein does not exist here. Expose, secure and protect the superficial radial nerve ramus. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle. Deposition after ligation, strictly subfascial release. Exposure of the flexor carpi ulnar. Strictly subfascial dissection with clipping of outgoing vessels. After complete elevation of the graft, isolate the vascular pedicle. A relatively stable larger vein can be visualized in the cranial part of the graft. This is dissected proximally to the specimen and opens into the cupital vein. There is a strong bridge between the accompanying veins of the radial artery and the cupital system, which is why the vein is included. The very slender anterior interosseous artery must be clipped. Securing the ulnar artery. A very strong vessel here. Isolate the graft on a strong cupital vein and the radial artery. Reopening of the tourniquet. Immediate regular graft and hand perfusion. Meticulous hemostasis and, after removal of the graft, removal of the full-thickness skin graft from the groin and careful two-layer wound closure. A vacuum sealing dressing is then applied and the stretcher splint is placed in the functional position. For full-thickness skin harvesting from the left groin. For this purpose, cutting of a 12 x 6 cm full-thickness skin graft with strict cutaneous elevation. Subcutaneous undermining and mobilization and strong multi-layer wound closure under moderate tension after insertion of a 10 Redon drain. Now turn to the insertion of the graft. After placing sutures in the area of the dorsal soft palate and towards the nasopharynx, insertion of the graft. The situation here is somewhat difficult with a relatively thick subcutaneous fat layer. Overall, however, a good fit. Complete coverage of the tonsil lobe and the soft palate defect. If the conditions are intact, turn to the vascular anastomosis. Conditioning of the graft vessels. In comparison, the artery is most likely to be equivalent in caliber to the facial artery. Therefore preparation of the vessel. Deposition after clipping. Careful conditioning of the facial artery and somewhat more difficult with a relatively small vessel, but finally good and sufficient anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. After reopening, immediate venous return and regular graft perfusion. Due to the positioning, the caudally very strong external jugular vein appears to be well suited for conditioning the vein cranial clipping, there is good flow on the vein, therefore preparation for anastomosis. Measurement of a size 4.0 coupler and problem-free performance of the venous anastomosis with the coupler system. After reopening the clamps, immediate regular graft perfusion and regular pedicle pulsation. After checking the wound, insertion of a 10 Redon drain. Splinting of the drainage with 3.0 Vicryl and careful two-layer wound closure. Multiple enoral inspections of the graft and, in the case of regular vitality with slim enoral conditions, no tracheotomy and completion of the procedure after the patient had been repositioned without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT2 oral cavity carcinoma intraoperative reactive lymphadenopathy differential diagnosis cN+ neck status. Depending on the histological findings, planning of adjuvant therapy if necessary. Postoperative meticulous flap monitoring by enoral inspection. Avoidance of pressure dressings, especially on the right cervical side in the case of vein anastomization to the external jugular vein. The patient received intraoperative i.V. antibiotics with Sobelin 600 mg for penicillin allergy; please continue this for 24 hours postoperatively. If the graft heals properly, a gradual diet can be started from the 8th postoperative day.","Transoral resection with defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Neck dissection, PEG placement

The findings were discussed in detail with the patient preoperatively.,"Anesthesia induction by the anesthesia colleagues and performance of a rigid tracheoscopy using O° optics. Inconspicuous conditions in the area of the trachea up to the carina. Subsequent transoral endotracheal intubation using a laser tube, tube fixation and positioning of the patient by the surgeon. A flexible oesophagogastroscopy is then performed using an endoscope, which is advanced to the stomach under visualization. Slightly polypoid mucosal changes in the area of the entire stomach in the sense of chronic gastritis, otherwise no evidence of an exophytic mass or unstable mucosal changes. Endoscopic inversion and inspection of the esophageal junction, inconspicuous conditions there. Then withdraw the endoscope and inspect the esophagus. Inconspicuous conditions there. Then perform a rigid pharyngo- and laryngoscopy using a Kleinsasser C-tube. The posterior wall of the hypopharynx and the esophageal entrance, the piriform sinuses on both sides, the posterior wall of the oropharynx and the side walls were also unremarkable. The base of the tongue was unremarkable on endoscopy and palpation. The endolarynx was then adjusted using a Kleinsasser C-tube. In the area of the right vocal fold, an exophytic mass covered with rough mucosa was found, starting directly anterior to the vocal process and extending posteriorly to the anterior commissure, but leaving out the anterior part of the left vocal fold, thus cT1a glottic laryngeal carcinoma on the right. Set the laser beam to 4 watts in continuous mode and successively move around the glottic change at a wide distance. The specimen is removed in toto and sent in for final histology with a suture marker (anteriorly towards the anterior commissure). Four marginal samples were taken (supraglottic towards the pocket fold, subglottic slope, posterior towards the vocal process, anterior towards the anterior commissure), which are sent for intraoperative frozen section examination. The intraoperative frozen section examination reveals in situ carcinoma in the marginal sample ""supraglottic towards the pocket fold"" as well as chronic inflammatory changes in the marginal sample ""subglottic slope"" (still requiring clarification there). A resection is therefore performed in the supraglottic area (""supraglottic resection"") and a second marginal sample is taken there (""2nd supraglottic marginal sample""). The same procedure is followed in the subglottis. A post-resectate is taken there (""post-resectate subglottis"") and a second subglottic marginal sample (""2nd marginal sample subglottis"") is taken. Hemostasis using swabs soaked in Suprarenin. Repeated inspection and administration of SDH 250 mg intravenously. Removal of all laryngeal swabs and completion of the procedure under dry conditions. Conclusion: This was a transoral, microlaryngoscopic laser-assisted tumor resection of a cT1a G2 squamous cell carcinoma of the right vocal fold. Please note final histology and schedule a follow-up microlaryngoscopy in 8 weeks.","Transoral microlaryngoscopic laser resection

Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery is indicated. There is already a history of PEG placement in the pre-panendoscopy.","Initial transoral tumor resection: insertion of reinforced retractors and placement of the tumor. The carcinoma, which is located in the middle to posterior third of the tongue, infiltrates into the base of the tongue, submucosally and anteriorly submucosally towards the tip of the tongue. The tumor is removed from all sides with a safety margin of 1.5 - 2 cm. A minimal remnant remains in the area of the tip of the tongue, otherwise the entire tongue, parts of the floor of the mouth with extrinsic musculature and parts of the sublingual glands are removed. Also resection of the lingual nerve. The largest part of the base of the tongue also falls backwards. Tumor is thread-marked for frozen section histology. All edges of the specimen are tumor-free in the frozen section. Thus R0 resection. Now transfer to neck dissection: injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into each side of the neck. First neck dissection on the left: Curved skin incision. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. V. jugularis interna, A. carotis communis, A. carotis interna, externa. Visualization of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. Visualization of a rich venous plexus with connection between the external jugular vein, which is double and also has connections to the internal jugular vein via the facial vein. Subsequent evacuation of level II to V. The submandibular gland is also resected cranially. A tunnel measuring 3 QF is then created from transoral to transcervical. This is followed by neck dissection on the right side. This is carried out in the same way as on the left side, exposing the structures mentioned. The submandibular gland is left in place. Levels II to IV are removed. Then elevation of the radial lobe: Marking of the defect in the appropriate extent and size. Maximum length 10 cm, maximum width 6.5 to 7 cm. Mark the flap and cut around it, first from the ulnar and then from the radial side. The radial artery is clamped with the clamp without cutting it first. Then cut up to the olecranon and expose the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the vascular pedicle. Exposure of the superficial venous system. Overall stable saturation, no drop, constant 100% saturation in the area of the right hand. Subsequent detachment of the flap from the ulnar and radial subfacial side, taking the superficial venous system with it from the radial side. Preservation of the lateral antebrachial nerve. Separation of the radial artery and treatment of this using a puncture ligature and 4-0 prolene distally and proximally. Subsequent elevation of the flap along its deep and superficial pedicle. Outgoing vessels are treated using a clip or bipolar. Connections between the deep and superficial venous system can be visualized and lifted in the crook of the elbow. 2 ends of the cephalic vein can be removed. Likewise the radial artery before the exit of the interosseous artery. The radial vein is removed after confluence in a new division. A vein remains in the area of the brachial or ulnar artery. Flushing of the vessels with heparin solution. Subsequent insertion of the radial artery flap: insertion into the defect. Successive suturing of the flap with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. This is achieved without tension while closing the tongue and floor of mouth defect or base of tongue defect and palatal arch defect. The stalk was passed through the already created tunnel into the left side of the neck. After conditioning the vessels, an arterial anastomosis between the facial and radial arteries was performed using Ethilon 8-0 single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow and good venous return. Subsequent venous anastomosis between an outlet from the bundle between the external jugular vein and the facial vein with connection to the internal jugular vein. Coupler size 3 was used for this, followed by a further anastomosis between the other outlet of the cephalic vein and the remaining external jugular vein using coupler 2.5. Good venous return in each case, positive smear phenomenon. This is followed by careful hemostasis of the entire wound area, irrigation with H202 and Ringer's solution. Subsequently, wound closure in layers on both sides of the neck with insertion of a Redon drain in each case. To cover the wound in the area of the right forearm, a piece of skin measuring approx. 11 x 6 cm was removed from the right groin. After ........... of the skin, the wound is closed in layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. The full-thickness skin is then sutured into the defect. This was successful without tension. The wound towards the crook of the elbow is closed in the typical way in layers. The arm is treated with a hydrogel Mepilex dressing. Loose compress dressing on top. Wrap with a absorbent cotton dressing. Then fit a Cramer splint and wrap the forearm with an elastic bandage. Finally, tracheostoma placement: small Kocher collar incision between the neck incisions. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature, which is split. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped, severed and supplied by means of a puncture ligature. Exposure of the trachea, which is positioned relatively. Extensive skin mobilization to enable better epithelialization. Finally, epithelialization is achieved with relatively little tension in a typical manner. After insertion of the relatively wide Björk flap, insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula is possible without any problems. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue the antibiotic treatment that was started intraoperatively for one week. Patient should be fed via PEG, if necessary after swallowing porridge in approx. 7-10 days. Heparin perfusor 500 E/hour, which was started intraoperatively, should be continued for 5 days. Flap control clinically and by means of Doppler at the sites marked by sutures for 5 days according to the scheme. Overall cT2-3 tongue margin carcinoma on the left, suspicious lymph nodes on both sides. Procedure after final histology and discussion in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Resection, Neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Depiction of the cervical vascular sheath. The external carotid artery as well as the hypoglossal nerve can only be separated from the metastatic conglomerate and preserved with difficulty. Exposure, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve. The internal carotid artery can be easily dissected during the procedure, as can the vagus nerve. This is relocated in the sense of a neurolysis and re-embedded. The internal jugular vein is infiltrated in the upper area. It is placed caudally and ligated twice. Cranially, the lower parotid pole must also be resected as the metastasis grows to this point. All the muscles of the styloid fan are removed. The styloid process must also be resected. Larger parts of the cervical plexus in the cranial part must be resected together with the deep neck muscles, as must of course the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The accessorius nerve is included in the preparation. The V. facialis and V. thyroidea can be preserved. The submandibular gland is also removed. An infiltration of the parapharyngeal space and growth along the internal carotid artery, hypoglossal nerve and vagus nerve can be seen towards the base of the skull. Soft tissue is removed from here, as well as from the area around the styloid process, which was also resected. Tissue is also removed from the right lower pole of the carotid artery. In the frozen section, infiltrations in the skull base margin sample, i.e. around the internal carotid artery and the large cranial nerves. The internal jugular vein was placed very close to the base of the skull and ligated twice. Infiltration by tumor cells, at least microscopically, is also possible here, but was not specifically confirmed by a sample. The tumor is now resected: the facial, superior thyroid and lingual arteries can be preserved. The hypoglossal nerve is also preserved after visualization. Defect in the area of the pharyngeal wall is visualized. The entire pharyngeal wall is resected, including larger parts of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Extensive resection in the area of the pterygoid muscles, which is also resected up to the level of the tube. A marginal sample is taken from the posterior pharyngeal wall from the level of the tube to the hypopharyngeal entrance and sent in labeled with a suture. A marginal sample is also taken caudal-basally from the area of the pharyngeal musculature at the hypopharyngeal entrance. Marginal sample from the cranial-basal area from the area of the remaining pterygoid muscles. A marginal sample was also taken from the transition from the posterior pharyngeal wall to the posterior palatal arch or nasopharyngeal mucosa area. In addition, a marginal sample was taken from the medial pterygoid muscle, which remained on the mandible and was also inconspicuous macroscopically. Infiltrates in the cranial-basal area in the frozen section. Therefore, another extensive soft tissue resection and marginal sample from the pterygoid muscle area next to the tube as well as a mucosal marginal sample with an extensive soft tissue mantle from the palatal mucosa in the hard palate. No more infiltrates here. Overall, an R1 situation is confirmed in the area of the base of the skull, along the cranial nerves and the internal carotid artery. As a final marginal sample, soft tissue was again removed from the entire area, including the spinal column and transition to the mastoid, and sent in for final diagnosis in order to obtain an overview of the extent of the R1 situation. R1 situation certainly also despite R0 situation after marginal samples in the area of the paratubular soft tissue in the pterygoid muscles and soft tissue remaining there. Overall now large defect from the nasopharynx to the hypopharyngeal entrance. Defect coverage using a radial flap is indicated. The defect is measured, resulting in a flap size of approx. 15x10 cm. Irrigation of the wound area with hydrogen and Ringer's solution and extensive hemostasis. Neck dissection on the left side: Here too, as on the opposite side, evacuation level II to V. The internal and external carotid arteries, internal jugular vein, facial vein, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve and branches of the cervical plexus are all exposed and preserved. The vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and vagus nerve are relocated and re-embedded by means of neurolysis. Level II lymph nodes in the cranial region have to be dissected from the jugular vein, but are not infiltrative there. Nevertheless, lymph node metastases are also clinically present here. Tracheostoma creation: Small Kocher collar incision. Exposure through subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature. Splitting of these. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Undercutting of this, clamping of the same, severing and treatment by means of puncture ligatures. Exposure of the trachea. In the 2nd to 3rd intercartilaginous space, opening of the trachea and creation of a wide pedicled modified Björ flap. This is epithelized in the typical manner. Re-intubation and insertion of an 8 mm Woodbridge tube. Elevation of the forearm flap from the left forearm: Marking of the flap in the required three-dimensional dimension and size. Incision of the flap from ulnar subfascial. Incision in the crook of the elbow. Visualization of the superficial venous system with connection to the deep venous system. Subsequent exposure of the vascular pedicle below the brachioradialis muscle. Then elevation of the flap subfascially from the radial side. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve as far as possible given the size of the flap. Caudal exposure of the V. and A. radialis. After clamping for 10 minutes with good saturation, cut through. Treatment of the stumps using 4.0 Prolene single button sutures. Lift the flap successively along the stalk. Smaller vessels are clipped or bipolar coagulated. Exposure of the interosseous artery in the antecubital fossa. After clamping it for a few minutes, if it is well saturated, it is cut and clipped. Exposure of the entry of the radial artery into the brachial artery. Visualization of the confluence. This is split and not very suitable for anastomosis. Two good venous anastomosis options remain in the area of the cephalic vein. Removal of the flap. Veins are ligated. The brachial artery is supplied with 6.0 Vascufil. Flap is flushed with heparin. Split skin with a thickness of 0.8 mm is removed from the thigh area. Hydrocolloid dressing here. The forearm is primarily closed cranially after extensive hemostasis. Split skin is successively incorporated into the forearm defect. A Vacuseal dressing is applied over this in the typical manner. Suction 75 mmHg. Attachment of the arm. The radial artery flap is inserted into the defect. Successive suturing from transoral and transcervical, partly with the sutures in place. The flap can be sutured in place without tension. Replacement of the pharyngeal side wall and posterior pharyngeal wall and palatal arch. Sutured cranially to the tubal cartilage. The stalk is passed below the hypoglossal nerve into the soft tissues of the neck. The regions at the base of the skull showing the R1 situation were marked with clips beforehand. The vessels were then conditioned. The still outgoing V. facialis and V. thyroidea media are selected as connecting vessels. The facial artery is selected and anastomized with the radial artery after conditioning with 9.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and good venous return. The larger cephalic vein is anastomosed to the facial vein with 4.0 couplers after conditioning. Good venous return after opening the clamps. Positive smear phenomenon. The smaller vein is anastomosed with the V. thyroidea media with a 2.5 mm coupler. Good venous return here too. Positive smear phenomenon. Overall good perfusion of the flap. Careful hemostasis and irrigation of the neck. Wound closure in layers on the right with insertion of two flaps. Application of a pressure bandage. Skin closure on the left with insertion of a Redon drain after extensive hemostasis and irrigation. Application of a pressure bandage. The epithelialized tracheostoma is supplied with an 8 mm tracheostomy tube. This is sutured in place. Wound dressing. Completion of the procedure without complications. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist. Conclusion: Overall cT4 tonsillar carcinoma with almost per continuitatem growth or contact with a very large soft tissue metastasis, which in turn showed infiltrations into the skull base or caudal parotid pole. Almost N3 metastasis on the right, total lymph node metastases on both sides. Overall extensive tumor volume, which justified resection to this extent in view of the HPV-positive status. Postoperative RCT indicated as soon as possible. Patient admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Antibiotic treatment, which was started intraoperatively with Unacid 3 g, should be continued for one week. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube, after loosening the next day. Flap control enorally or by Doppler for five days. Heparin perfusor, which was started intraoperatively at 500 units/hour, should be continued for five days. X-ray pre-swallow on the 10th day, then diet build-up if necessary.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Free flap (Radial)

There is now an indication for transoral resection. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.,"After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carrying out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesiologist. Induction of anesthesia. Transition to rigid tracheoscopy. Adjustment of the glottis and passing through it using the 0° optics. The mucosal conditions are unremarkable on all sides up to the exit of the segmental bronchi. The patient is then intubated by the surgeon. Transition to esophagogastroscopy. Insertion of the flexible endoscope under visualization and constant air insufflation into the stomach. This reveals a typical gastric mucosal relief without irritation on all sides. Inversion and inspection of the gastroesophageal junction. This appears unremarkable. After desufflation, slow withdrawal of the endoscope with circular inspection of all sections of the esophagus. There is no evidence of a tumor here. Remove the flexible endoscope. Insertion of the mouth guard. Prior to this, the patient is positioned in head reclination. Enter with the size C small bore tube. Adjustment of the endolarynx. This appears unremarkable. Inspection of the hypopharynx on both sides. Here the piriform sinus is lined with smooth mucosa on all sides up to the tip and can be freely unfolded. Subsequent inspection of the oropharynx. A somewhat uneven mucosa can be seen in the area of the right-sided base of the tongue. This is also biopsied. Primarily no urgent malignant findings. Otherwise unremarkable mucosal conditions in the area of the oropharynx. Inspection of the edge of the tongue on the left side.

Extensive metastasis on CT with extension into the parapharyngeal space. Sonographic cN3 neck status. Now indication for completion of the CUP diagnosis and resection of the extensive metastasis on the left side.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesiology colleagues, the patient is first positioned and then the small water tube is inserted under dental protection. After inspection of the inconspicuous oral vestibule. The oral cavity is inconspicuous. In the area of the oropharynx, the tonsils are scarred and cryptic on both sides, slight asymmetry in favor of the left side, but no exophytic tumor. The base of the tongue is seen on the left side with questionable slight tissue plus, otherwise macroscopically not suspicious. The rest of the oropharynx is unremarkable and clear, as are the endolarynx and the hypopharynx, which is slightly edematous and cannot be fully adjusted due to the physiognomy, but is clear as far as can be assessed. Inconspicuous postcricoid region. Corresponding to the diagnostic imaging, a diagnostic tonsillectomy is now performed on the left side and, in the case of slightly raised findings in the area of the base of the tongue, a representative biopsy of the base of the tongue is taken. Tonsillectomy performed using the classic dissection technique. Significant scarring of the tonsil capsule, but rather no tumor growth, therefore initially no resection towards the parapharyngeal space due to the extensive metastasis. Protection of the parauvular mucosal triangle and the posterior palatal arch and removal of the tonsil in toto. Careful hemostasis. Inspection of the tonsil after removal reveals an exophytic change after opening in the area of the cranial tonsil pole or here in the area of the crypts, which is highly suspicious, so the specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section diagnostics. This confirms the clinical suspicion of a tonsillar carcinoma, CIS forming margins in the area of the cranial pole, otherwise an R0 situation at all levels. Therefore, complete resection of the cranial tonsil ........., partly with soft palate-parauvular tissue and upper part of the posterior palatal arch. Complete imaging margin specimen. In the frozen section diagnostics, this is again completely tumor-free, therefore safe R0 resection here. The sample taken from the base of the tongue was tumor-free. In the meantime, the PEG was inserted. This was done with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy to see through to the stomach. This was inconspicuous and clear. With good diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. On reflection, the esophagus is clear and unremarkable. We now turn to the neck dissection. A coarse, moderately displaceable mass measuring clinically approx. 8 x 8 cm with clear infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is seen. The skin incision is now made from the mastoid to the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose and cut through the platysma. This is clearly not infiltrated. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the caudal part. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. The cranial part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is completely infiltrated up to just before the mastoid insertion. Ligation and removal of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Separation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the level of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure and dissection of the internal jugular vein. Overall, significantly more difficult preparation conditions due to the patient's physiognomy. It can now be seen that the metastasis surrounds the cervical vascular sheath by approx. 180° and clearly extends to level V a. Here, subtotal infiltration of the cervical plexus, as well as infiltration of the phrenic nerve and the border cord. In addition, infiltration of the paravertebral musculature. En bloc resection here of the metastasis. Separation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the mastoid. Separation of the internal jugular vein. Anterior free dissection and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. The facial vein is removed during infiltration. Dissection of the caudal parotid pole. This works well. No infiltration here. There is now a circumscribed infiltration of the posterior digastric venter muscle. This is also generously resected. Infiltration of the barely visible hypoglossal nerve. Complete infiltration of the accessorius nerve. Now dissection directly onto the common carotid artery. Exposure and securing of the vagus nerve. Shortly after the exit of the superior thyroid artery, the external carotid artery is seen to be infiltrated. This is also removed. Removal of the infiltrated branch of the facial artery. Resection of the metastasis cranially up to the transverse process of the atlas and close to the spinal column, but here still covering the muscle layer. No tumor growth cranial to the digastric muscle, so that the metastasis can be removed in toto without opening the pharynx. Careful hemostasis. Evacuation of level V a and b remnants. Finally, no evidence of lymphatic leakage. Protection of the transverse cervical artery. Extensive wound irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution and, if the wound is absolutely dry, insertion of two 10-gauge Redon drains if the wound area is extensive. Subsequent careful, two-layer wound closure. Final enoral inspection, in this case dry conditions. To further reduce the pharyngo-cervical fistula, the posterior and anterior palatal arch is adapted using 3-0 Vicryl mucosal sutures. Completion of the procedure with slim mucosa conditions. Conclusion: Intraoperatively histologically confirmed cT1 cN3 G2 R0 left tonsillar carcinoma. Please leave the Redon drains in place for at least 3 days due to the extensive wound cavity and plan adjuvant radiochemotherapy promptly.","Tonsillectomy, Neck dissection, PEG placement

Dissection is performed along the vein and vagus nerve as well as the common carotid artery from cranial to caudal, down to below the omohyoid muscle. The caudal edge of the sedimentation is stitched several times with Vicryl sutures to prevent a fistula. Now further dissection of the jugular vein anteriorly. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve. Dissection of the anterior part of the neck, removal of the capsule of the submandibular gland and dissection from cranial to caudal. This results in a complete neck dissection. No bleeding. Irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Minor oozing bleeding is stopped with bipolar coagulation. Insertion of a Redon drain. Subcutaneous suture, skin suture and pressure bandage. Another check of the primary resection with the small water tube: there is no major bleeding here. No swelling either. It is therefore decided not to tracheotomize the patient in the first instance. The patient is extubated and transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Detailed consultation with the anesthesia department regarding the further procedure. Please note: Further perioperative administration of Unacid.","Transoral Laser Resection, Neck dissection, PEG placement

Air insufflation and identification of the anterior wall of the stomach. Perform a positive diaphanoscopy and then place the PEG tube in the area of the lateral canal in the usual manner using the thread pull-through method. Aspiration of air and subtle retraction of the endoscope with constant air insufflation. Neck dissection on the right: Start with neck dissection on the right side using a skin incision in the area of the old scar. Separation of the cutaneous-subcutaneous tissue and identification of the platysma. Overall, extremely scarred conditions are seen here following neck dissection and radiotherapy. In consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, it was decided not to proceed with the neck dissection. One reason is the current ycN0 neck status, the scarred conditions and, in particular, a possible secondary microvascular defect reconstruction of the tongue. Therefore, no further action is taken and the wound is closed again. After appropriate preparation, first insert the retractors and dislodge the tongue at the fixation suture. Then look at the tumor located medially in the posterior third, which extends a little further to the right than to the opposite side by palpation. Start resection at the anterior left margin. Here, the tumor is successively removed through the healthy musculature at an appropriate safety distance using the monopolar caustic technique. First, resection is performed on the left edge of the tumor in order to preserve the lingual artery, which is ultimately successful. The tumor is then successively removed from the left side through the muscles of the inner tongue. A sufficient safety margin can also be maintained in the area of the base of the tongue. The resection is somewhat more extensive on the right side, but a narrow strip of tissue remains in the area of the base of the tongue. Careful hemostasis by bipolar coagulation. On inspection of the resectate, the left anterior tumor resection margin is slightly less distant at the same side as the tumor. Therefore, a resection is performed on the tongue. Subsequently, marginal samples are taken from the entire circumference at the base of the tumor for a frozen section histological examination. These all proved to be tumor-free, so that an R0 resection can be assumed. Although the subsequent defect is extensive, it does not infiltrate particularly deeply, largely preserving the base of the tongue, so that no construction is necessary. Neck dissection can also be dispensed with in the case of cN0 status and previous neck dissection on both sides. Removal of the instruments without tooth damage and transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Transoral tumor resection of the median-dorsal tongue tumor. Intraoperative rapid section histologic R0 resection. No neck dissection in the case of previous neck dissection due to the nasopharyngeal carcinoma and primary reconstruction due to the configuration of the defect","Transoral Tumor Resection, PEG placement

There is a tumor that covers the entire palatal arch area from the upper tonsillar lobe on the right to the left side. Growth also on the back. No growth into the tube. However, growth also in the direction of the hard palate. Overall flap coverage indicated. Radialis flap not possible for vascular reasons, as Allen test not sufficient on both sides and other diagnostics likewise. Upper arm flap and other usual flap plasty not possible due to the required pedicle length. It was therefore decided to cover the defect with a latissimus dorsi flap together with the maxillofacial surgeon.","The patient is first taken to the operating room and prepared by the anesthesia colleagues. Tracheotomy: Horizontal skin incision at the level of the cricoid. Separation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Identification of the infralaryngeal musculature and division of the musculature in the midline. Sharp dissection of the cricoid cartilage. Identification of the thyroid isthmus and undermining of the isthmus with a clamp. Separation of the isthmus after bipolar coagulation and identification of the anterior tracheal wall. Creation of a visor tracheotomy between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma in the usual manner and insertion of a 9-gauge cannula. Subsequent attempt at PEG insertion. PEG insertion not possible, therefore secondary insertion by surgical or internal medicine colleagues if diaphanoscopy is insufficient. Subsequent transoral tumor resection. Positioning of the head. Insertion with the McIvor oral spatula. Successive resection of the tumor with a safety margin of 1 to 1.5 cm on all sides. Here too, the mucosa is first pushed away from the hard palate, the palatal bone is already resected in the marginal area. The entire tonsil with the adjacent palatal arch area falls from left to right. The tumor is successfully removed in toto with a macroscopic safety margin on all sides. The tumor is thread-marked. A marginal sample is taken from the mucosal area in the posterior palatal arch at the border to the vomer. The specimen and marginal sample are sent for frozen section. In the frozen section, according to the pathology department, there is still a CIS in the caudal region on both sides, i.e. in the area of the mucosa below the tonsil lobe. Equally uncertain situation with CIS that cannot be ruled out in the area of the marginal sample in the direction of the vomer. Therefore, extensive resection of a mucosal strip in the area of the mucosal transition from the lower tonsil pole towards the hypopharynx. This is done from both sides, whereby the marginal samples are sent in 2 parts. Likewise, clear resection with further removal of the vomer and subsequent resection of the soft tissue behind and below it. All soft tissue and bone parts are sent for frozen section. No more carcinoma in situ infiltrates detectable here. Therefore now R0 resection. Neck dissection on the right side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Exposure of the platysma and subplatysmal blunt dissection. Finding the external jugular vein. This is extremely thick and has a bifurcation. Ligation of the medial part and preservation and retraction of the lateral part. Dissection of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and identification of the omohyoid muscle. Dissection along this and exposure of the submandibular muscle. Elevation of the submandibular glenoid with the Langenbeck and lateral dissection on the digastric muscle. Identification of the accessorius nerve and preservation of this. Now dissect the cervical vascular sheath and dissect the internal jugular vein cranially. Preservation of the facial nerve and finding and preserving the hypoglossal nerve. Now successive removal of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the accessorius nerve and the plexus branches. Identification of the vagus nerve and protection of this. Now also successive removal of the medial neck preparation. There is no evidence of bleeding. Insertion of a Redon drainage and two-layer wound closure. Neck dissection on the left side through <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Separation of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the platysma. Subplatysmal dissection of a skin flap. Identification of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. The nerve can be pushed upwards and preserved, the external jugular vein is ligated and cut. Dissection along the sternocleidomastoid muscle in depth with constant use of bipolar coagulation. Identification of the deep cervical fascia and the plexus branches of the cervical plexus as well as the accessorius nerve. Identification of the omohyoid muscle and dissection along the muscle medially to the hyoid bone. Identification of the posterior digastric venter muscle and dissection along the muscle anteriorly to the hyoid bone. The cervical lymph node regions II, III and IV as well as I b are removed after free dissection of the submandibular gland and removal of the surrounding lymph nodes. The neurovascular structures can be preserved. No major bleeding and no injury to the accessorius nerve. For the planned flap anastomosis, the superior thyroid artery is conditioned and dissected free and the internal jugular vein is dissected free in a circular fashion. The latissimus dorsi flap is then removed. First position the patient so that the left latissimus dorsi flap can be removed accordingly. (<CLINICIAN_NAME>, maxillofacial surgery). The flap is then removed and a vascular connection is made, also by the anesthesia colleagues. Skin closure in the cervical area on both sides in a typical manner with insertion of a Redon drain in each case. Careful hemostasis and irrigation beforehand. Further inspection of the flap enorally. This is vital. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the Medical Intensive Care Unit 1 for monitoring. Please continue antibiotic treatment with Unacid, which was started intraoperatively, for 1 week. Flap control according to the scheme for 5 days. Nutrition via the intraoperatively inserted gastric tube. Please arrange for a PEG to be inserted at intervals by the surgical or anesthesia colleagues once the wound has healed.

The immediate preoperative ultrasound showed a cN2c neck status with questionable infiltration of the internal jugular vein.","First perform a pharyngoscopy. Insertion of the open mouth retractors. An exophytic tumor can be seen in the area of the anterior palatal arch, sitting on the ascending mandibular branch, coarsely caked here and rather difficult to move. Growth to parauvular. The tonsillar lodge is used up, also clear infiltration of the posterior palatal arch. Growth continues over the glossotonsillar groove into the edge of the tongue, which is also circumscribed towards the posterior floor of the mouth and extends to approx. 3 cm in the area of the edge of the tongue as well as clear infiltration of the base of the tongue to approx. 1/4. Caudally in the area of the pharyngeal side wall, the tumor extends caudally to about the level of the oropharyngeal border. Epiglottis, vallecula and supraglottic region are free. The posterior wall of the oropharynx is also free. Now resection of the tumor transorally with the electric knife and using the dissection technique. Resection hard to parauvular while maintaining a safety margin of at least 1-1.5 cm. Removal of the entire anterior palatal arch, resection up to the buccal. Resection of the posterior palatal arch en bloc, in the area of the ascending mandibular branch here periosteal growth, but no infiltration. Infiltration of medial pterygoid muscles, therefore now exposure of the mandibular bone in the area of the ascending mandibular branch, pushing off the periosteum here with the raspatory. Resection of the posterior floor of the mouth and the edge of the tongue. Here too, maintaining a safety margin of at least 1 to 1.5 cm on all sides. Resection up to the base of the tongue and, in the case of resection in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth, exposure of the submandibular gland enorally after detachment of the tumor from the posterior pharyngeal wall. After complete detachment, the tumor is now left in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth and the base of the tongue, and the decision is made to proceed transcervically with better local control. Later, the parts of the lower jaw close to the tumor are also trimmed with the rose bur. Covering samples are now taken from the edges of the tongue, the posterior floor of the mouth, the soft palate and the buccal mucosa. These are assessed as completely tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Now repositioning and turning to the neck dissection with tumor resection on the right side. Skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and the auricularis magnus nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. Exposure and free dissection of the internal jugular vein, careful dissection here. A clearly caked lymph node conglomerate can now be seen in the area of the venofacial angle. The facial vein itself is only very weakly developed and must be removed in the area of the metastases. Otherwise, there are no other internal jugular veins. The jugular vein is not infiltrated after careful dissection. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery. Expose the hypoglossal nerve. Now expose the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and clearing of level Vb with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Subcapsular release of the submandibular gland. Resection of the digastric muscle, subtotal removal of the gland and thus performance of the pharyngotomy. The pharyngotomy is opened in the anterior region of the resection margins. Now reopen the mouth retractor and perform a combined resection towards the base of the tongue caudally to the vallecula and from the outside to the level of the hyoid. The tongue base resection is now separated from the cranial oropharyngeal resection for a better overview. Now turn back to the neck. It quickly becomes apparent that all branches of the external carotid artery and the cranial thyroid artery lead to the tumor. The facial and lingual arteries are therefore ligated, as is the maxillary artery. The internal carotid artery is now separated together with the vagus nerve from the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle up to the level of the styloid process and thus safely spared. Using the styloid process as a landmark, the entire lateral pharyngeal musculature is resected from caudal to cranial up to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Now repeat the procedure enorally. The styloid process can also be identified here and serve as a guide for the resection. In the end, a 5 cm resectate is created. Due to the large wound area, 3 separate marginal samples are taken from the wound bed. In addition to the posterior pharyngeal wall central margin sample and the vallecula and hyoid margin samples. These are later all assessed as tumor-free. Therefore, an intraoperative R0 resection can be assumed here. Finally, as described above, the areas of growth close to the periosteum in the area of the ascending alveolar ridge are removed with the drill. Moderate connection conditions now remain on the right side in the area of the right external jugular vein and the remaining superior thyroid artery. Therefore, after previously measuring a graft adapted for the soft palate, tongue, tongue edge and floor of the mouth with a total area of 11 x 8 cm, a radial graft is lifted with special consideration of the posterior floor of the mouth and the edge of the tongue with the possibility of bilateral connection. Therefore, the radial flap is now lifted in parallel. Unwrap the arm and apply the tourniquet. After marking the graft, cut around the graft. Exposure and securing of the cephalic vein. Perform the same maneuver and expose the radial superficial ramus nerve. These can be completely spared. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle and the cephalic vein. A skin monitor is not used in the course of potential bilateral anastomosis. Exposure of the radial veins, these are relatively slender distally. Blunt exposure Ligation of the distal vascular pedicle. Release of the distal vascular pedicle. Now strictly subfascial dissection. Further release of the graft. Circumscribed visible ulnar artery, but no further dissection and safe protection. Now complete subfascial elevation of the graft, exposing a cancerous bridge between the radial vein and cephalic vein in the area of the crook of the elbow. Salvage of this bridge, clipping of outgoing venous branches. Exposure of the radial artery before the exit of the very strong and significantly larger ulnar artery; a true anterior interosseous artery is not found here. Marking of the artery and reopening of the tourniquet. After a total of 90 minutes, minute hemostasis, regular flap perfusion and preparation for subsequent flap elevation. After graft displacement, an 11 x 8 cm piece of full-thickness skin is removed from the groin. In the groin area, after strict cutaneous elevation, subcutaneous mobilization and, if the wound is dry, placement of a 10-gauge Redon drainage and careful, strong, two-layer wound closure and later incorporation of the full-thickness skin graft and here, after careful wound inspection, two-layer wound closure. Complete incorporation of the full-thickness skin graft in this case with a complex flap, therefore somewhat more difficult incorporation conditions, but finally sufficient closure, application of a vacuum seal and application of the Kramer splint in the usual manner. At the same time, the neck dissection was performed on the left side. To do this, also make a skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the playtsma. Creation of a platysma flap, exposure of the external jugular vein, which is very narrow here, and the auricular nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical artery and the very slender superior thyroid artery. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure and free preparation of the internal jugular vein. A macroscopically conspicuous lymph node measuring approx. 2 x 1.5 cm without infiltration of neighboring structures can be seen in the area of the jugulofacial angle. V. facialis is relatively weakly developed here, but is preserved. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Careful release of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and release of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Finally, dry wound conditions and no evidence of lymph leakage in level V. After wound irrigation with Ringer's solution, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure with primary graft connection attempt on the right side. Now perform a plastic tracheotomy. To do this, make a horizontal skin incision sparingly to avoid a possible connection to the cervical resection areas. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Cut through the infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Bipolar coagulation of the very thin thyroid isthmus. Further exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring: creation of a broad-based pedunculated Björk flap. Incision of the tracheostoma with mucocutaneous anastomosis and subsequent problem-free intubation onto an LE tube. Later reintubation onto an 8-gauge cannula with inner core, which is fixed by suturing. Now, after recovery of the graft, incorporation of the graft transenorally. In this case, with significant tongue swelling and edematous conditions, relatively difficult insertion conditions. Laborious reconstruction of the soft palate and suturing in the area of the cheek soft tissue, the posterior floor of the mouth and the edge of the tongue. Overall, however, a good fit. Finally, transcervical suturing of the base of the tongue and the lateral pharyngeal wall. Finally, tight conditions and sufficient flap detachment. Now condition the vessels by free preparation of the cubital subcutaneous veins carried out in the evening. Now a good opportunity for adequate pedicle positioning. Careful fixation of the pedicle peripherally with Vicryl sutures. Separation of the superior thyroid artery after peripheral clipping. Here after opening good flow. Conditioning of the vessels and anastomosis with 8.8 Ethilon in relatively equal caliber conditions. This is initially successful. However, there is now a marked vulnerability in the area of both vessels. There are several tears in the vessels, so that a stable and tight anastomosis cannot be achieved despite several attempts at suturing. Therefore excision of the anastomosis. The flap artery and the superior thyroid artery are shortened and a new vascular anastomosis is performed. This is successful despite difficult suture conditions. Immediate regular venous return with good flap perfusion. Venous return is strong, but only via one of the two elevated cubital veins. Therefore clipping of the 2nd vein. Conditioning of the external jugular vein, which is thrombosed in the meantime, therefore shortening of the vein. Free preparation continued, irrigation with heparin. Finally, good flow and clear conditions. After removal of a thrombus, careful irrigation and sizing of a 2.5 mm coupler and subsequent problem-free venous anastomosis with the coupler. A well-positioned pedicle with relatively stable conditions and excellent flap perfusion enorally is now evident, so that careful two-layer wound closure with a caudally extended flap is now performed and the procedure is completed at this point. Conclusion: Due to the intraoperative extension cT3 cN2c oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right with R0 situation macroscopically and in the frozen section diagnosis. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 c. Postoperative regular enoral flap vitality control in the absence of a skin monitor. Due to the venous anastomosis located directly subcutaneously on the right side at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, strict attention must be paid to avoiding pressure bandages or similar. Depending on the endoscopy findings, diet build-up and, if necessary, decannulation are possible from the 8th postoperative day.","Tumor resection, Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial)

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, it was decided to perform a transoral resection, in this case with TORS.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, the first step is to use the small bore tube to inspect the local findings. Inconspicuous oral cavity and oropharynx. In the area of the laryngeal epiglottis, a largely exophytic mass is now seen, as described above, but in comparison progressive in size, which occupies the majority of the laryngeal epiglottis area, extends caudally to just before the petiolus, laterally just reaches the aryepiglottic fold on the left, extends over this on the right side to the pocket fold and here to just before the ary, but no ary infiltration. Now adjust the findings with the FK retractor. The resection is then performed under 30° optics in a robot-assisted manner with complete resection of the epiglottis via the vallecula down to the petiolus. No penetrating growth here, so that there is no extension into the pre-epiglottic space. Resection on the left side of the aryepiglottic fold up to the left side above the pocket fold, on the right side complete resection of the aryepiglottic fold up to the ary and partial removal of the pocket fold. For an overview, the tumor is successively resected and retracted using the piecemeal technique. Finally, covering marginal samples are taken. These are completely tumor-free, so that the overall situation is R0. Subsequent careful hemostasis. If the enoral situation is dry, perform selective neck dissection on both sides. Right-sided evacuation of levels II to IV with ligation of the external jugular vein and facial vein. Preservation of the auricular nerve after exposure of the surrounding musculature. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery, cervical artery, hypoglossal nerve, internal jugular vein, accessorius nerve. Overall, macroscopically no conspicuous nodules. Subsequent careful wound irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Turning to the left side. Exactly the same procedure here. Exposure of the bordering musculature. Ligation of the external jugular vein, which also runs obliquely. Also ligation of the facial vein. Overall, as on the opposite side, significantly more difficult preparation conditions with marked obesity and extremely short neck. Free preparation and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve, superior thyroid artery, accessorius nerve, internal jugular vein. Deposition of the preparation, as on the opposite side, at the transition to level V. Careful hemostasis. Irrigate the wound with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. If the wound is dry, insert a 10-gauge Redon drain and carefully close the wound in two layers. Then perform the tracheotomy. To do this, make a horizontal incision at the level of the very deep cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring. Performing a wide tracheotomy.

The subsequent PET-CT scan showed an enhancement of the left tonsil region. Indication for the above-mentioned procedure. Secondary diagnosis: Post clear cell renal cell carcinoma on the right (nephrectomy <2012>).","After induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia department, transoral endotracheal intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Positioning of the patient for TE on the left. Dental status determined. Insertion of the McIvor oral spatula. The left tonsil is superficially unremarkable, no exophytic mass, but caudally marked induration. This finding is taken into account during the subsequent resection according to the demo and discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Now incision of the anterior palatal arch on the left, taking it along and intramuscular, step-by-step dissection in the caudal direction using the dissection technique. No evidence of major vascular bleeding under dissection technique. The dissection procedure is performed according to the instructions of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The tonsil is coarse in the caudal direction, for this reason resection with a safety margin of approx. 1 cm and thus resection of part of the left tongue base. The macroscopically resected specimen in sano is thread-marked (cranial margin of resection, caudal margin of resection, tongue margin, caudal margin of resection, glossotonsillar groove) and sent for frozen section examination. During this time, a PEG was inserted (described below in the report). Result of the frozen section examination: 2 cm large squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil. Cranial margin forming. Caudal resection in the area of the base of the tongue at a maximum of 1 mm with partial coagulation artifacts. Renewed demonstration of findings <CLINICIAN_NAME> and decision to carry out resections at exactly the above-mentioned sites and then to take marginal samples for frozen section examination. Thus generous resection of these sites by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The resections are sent for final histology. Then representative marginal samples are taken from the above-mentioned sites, which are sent for frozen section. These then show no malignancy. Thus R0-resected T2 tonsillar carcinoma on the left. With now extensive defect from parauvular over the soft palate to caudal to the base of the tongue, renewed demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>, hemostasis using bipolar, finally 2 adjacent sutures to suture over the lateral pharyngeal wall through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. No more evidence of bleeding. No fatty tissue from the lateral pharyngeal wall. Operation completed without complications. Dental status fixed. All swabs complete. No bleeding. Report on PEG placement (see above): Insertion of the flexible esophagogastroscope under bite guard and constant air insufflation, the esophageal mucosa is free on all sides and without irritation, no mass. In the stomach, air insufflation and regular unfolding of the inconspicuous mucosal relief. Clearly visible positive diaphanoscopy. Now placement of a PEG tube using the thread pull-through method in the typical manner, approx. 2 transverse fingers below the costal arch. The patient received 3 g Unacid i.v. perioperatively. A PEG tube was inserted without any problems. Conclusion: R0-resected T2 tonsillar carcinoma on the left in a frozen section after left neck dissection with pN2b neck status (2/23) and placement of a PEG tube. Significantly larger tumor size intraoperatively in contrast to the initial findings. Procedure: Planning of a neck dissection on the right and, depending on swallowing function and local findings, if necessary, defect coverage of the large oropharyngeal defect that has now developed (see above) using a microvascular anastomosed flap graft.

The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation. As part of the preoperative CT scan, cT1 cN0 glottic carcinoma on the left. Additional findings: cerebellar mass. This still needs to be clarified by magnetic resonance imaging in the interval.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carrying out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. Induction of anesthesia and intubation of the patient. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon. Insertion of the mouthguard. Insertion of the size D Kleinsasser tube. First, adjustment of the endolarynx. A scar is visible in the area of the left anterior third of the vocal fold. The anterior commissure is extremely difficult to adjust. Using the O° view, a slightly uneven area of mucosa can be seen in the area of the anterior vocal fold with a transition to the anterior commissure. Endolaryngeal laser resection does not appear to be a sensible option. Therefore, as discussed with the patient in advance, remove the Kleinsasser tube and proceed to chordectomy via a thyrofissure. First reposition the patient. Skin spray disinfection and infiltration anesthesia. Abjoration of the surgical site and sterile draping. Clear identification of the thyroid incissure and the level of the cricoid cartilage. Marking of the planned incision using the broken line technique. Sharp cutting of the cutis as well as the subcutis. Insertion of the sharp retractor. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Separation of the same in the area of the linea alba. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage. Incision of the perichondrium in the median line and formation of 2 perichondrium lobes. Horizontal incision in the area of the ligamentum conicum. Open the thyroid cartilage strictly in the median line using the wheel. Insertion of the 2-pronged retractor and meticulous inspection of the endolaryngeal findings. This shows the previously detected endoscopically unstable mucosal area in the area of the left anterior third of the vocal fold with transition to the anterior commissure. The 15 mm scalpel is now used to make a circular incision around the mass with an appropriate safety margin. Part of the perichondrium in the area of the anterior commissure is also resected. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for definitive histological processing. In addition, 4 marginal samples are taken (upper left vocal fold, lower left vocal fold, anterior commissure and right anterior commissure). All frozen sections were found to be tumor-free intraoperatively. There was also no evidence of CIS. Since all marginal specimens show the tumor area in a circular fashion, an R0 resection can be assumed. Grinding of the inner cortex in the area of the former left anterior third of the vocal fold. The remaining thyroarytaenoid muscle is preserved. Wound irrigation with H202 and Ringer's solution. Creation of a total of 4 drill holes. Closure of the laryngeal skeleton with PDS 4.0. Closure of the incision in the area of the ligamentum conicum. Suturing of the previously prepared perichondrium leaves. Readaptation of the prelaryngeal musculature. A second layer of prelaryngeal musculature is also stitched laterally over the median line to create a corresponding counterpressure. Finally, insertion of a flap, subcutaneous suture with Vicryl 4-0 and skin suture with Ethilon 5-0. Application of a wound dressing and completion of the operation without complications. Conclusion: This resulted in a chordectomy via a thyrofissure. Intraoperative R0. Preoperative computed tomography findings also cT1c N0. Due to the preoperative sonographic findings in the neck, please monitor closely and present the patient to the tumor conference as standard. With regard to the cerebellar mass, please undergo further magnetic resonance imaging during the inpatient stay.","Chordectomy through thyreofissure

Positioning of the patient by the surgeon. First, laryngoscopy is performed and an attempt is made to adjust the findings. Unfortunately, this was not successful. The decision is therefore made to reorganize the findings in the sense of a partial laryngectomy according to Leroux Robert. Skin spray disinfection, application of local anesthesia in a skin fold at the level of the thyroid cartilage. Skin ablation, sterile draping. Creation of an approx. 6 mm long incision in this skin fold. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Formation of a subplatysmal flap cranially and caudally. Exposure and transection of the prelaryngeal musculature in the midline. Undermining and ligation of some branches of the anterior jugular vein. Exposure of the cricothyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage. Scalpel incision along the thyroid vein. Separation of the perichondrium from the thyroid cartilage, horizontal incision of the cricothyroid vein using a monopolar needle. Median thyroidectomy using a small wire. Opening of the laryngeal lumen and inspection of the findings. Exophytic mass in the area of the anterior third of the left vocal fold and in the area of the anterior commissure. The findings were incised using scissors and 3 marginal samples were sent for intraoperative frozen section examination (left glottis, left subglottis, anterior commissure). Tiny CIS fragments were found in the left glottis margin specimen by the pathology colleague, thus resection in this region. A resection specimen is taken, which is sent for final histology and a second left glottis margin specimen is taken, which is sent for intraoperative frozen section examination. This time the pathology colleague found it to be tumor-free. Thus hemostasis endolaryngeal. Fitting of a size 16 Keel placeholder after drilling holes in the thyroid cartilage. Adjustment of the perichondrium leaves of the thyroid cartilage in the midline. The prelaryngeal musculature is sutured together in the midline. Creation of a flap, prelaryngeal platysma suture. Single button skin suture. Application of a pressure bandage, completion of the procedure without complications. Please plan control MLE and Keel removal in 6 weeks.

Identification of the radial nerve (external ramus). Sharp dissection of the subfascial nerve. Particular care is taken to leave sufficient tissue on the tendon of the brachioradialis muscle. Identification of the distal part of the radial artery. Provisional clamping with a vascular clamp. Wait 10 minutes, during which time a good perfusion signal is recorded in the area of the index finger. Separation of the distal radial artery with the comitant veins and ligation. Elevation of the radial artery graft from the depths with constant bipolar coagulation of smaller vessels and placement of several vascular clips. This was successful without any problems. Completion of flap elevation without complications. Deposition of the flap by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Wound closure using split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Incision of the graft: First, the back surface of the soft palate is fixed with three sutures. Folding and folding of the graft and suturing of the front and the tonsil region. The tonsil region is difficult to suture due to swelling of the tongue and small mouth opening. Ultimately, the flap can be sutured in completely and the stalk can be diverted to the right. Start with the anastomosis. The radial artery is connected to the superior thyroid artery. However, a problem then arises in that there is no venous return flow from the dissected veins. It is determined that the confluence between the upper and deeper venous system is insufficient in this radial artery graft. The entire upper venous system is therefore clamped off and the concomitant vein is used for connection. This shows very good reflux in both concomitant veins. Therefore, one is anastomosed end-to-side to the external vein and the second end-to-end to a branch of the facial vein using the coupler. Insertion of a flap and two-layer wound closure. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Flap and wound checks. At the end, a tracheostomy tube was inserted and fixed with a suture.

After appropriate preparation, skin disinfection and sterile washing. Marking and incision of the apron flap. Dissection cranially up to above the hyoid bone. Then perform the neck dissection on the right side. Skeletonization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the accessorius and hypoglossal nerves. Subsequently, clearing of regions II to IV with preservation of all non-lymphatic structures and dissection of the internal jugular vein and carotid artery. Subsequent exposure of the lateral hyoid horn and release of the infrahyoid muscles with exposure of the thyrohyoid membrane. Skeletonization of the common carotid artery and external carotid artery with exposure of the superior thyroid artery, along which the right thyroid lobe can also be separated from the laryngeal skeleton and displaced laterally. Cut and separate the straight prelaryngeal and prethyroid muscles. Subsequently undermine the thyroid isthmus down to the pretracheal lamina, clamp the isthmus so that the upper six tracheal clasps are fully exposed. Then sharply separate the insertions of the constrictor pharyngis muscle at the edge of the thyroid cartilage and release the piriform sinus on this side. Then transition to the opposite side. In principle, the procedure is the same here with the same findings. Perform the tracheotomy. Opening of the trachea under the 2nd tracheal clasp. Re-intubation of the patient. This is followed by a total laryngectomy. The lingual surface of the epiglottis is exposed up to the upper edge and the mucosa is only incised at the upper edge of the epiglottis. This allows it to be disluxed and the larynx to be removed along the epiglottis and finally postcricoidally. The protrusion of the left-dorsal tumor in the area of the cricoid cartilage can also be seen here, although it remains covered by intact mucosa or muscle tissue. The larynx is then released together with the two upper tracheal clips. Removal of a marginal sample from the caudal resection margin of the specimen towards the trachea as well as from retrolaryngeal tissue in the area of the tumour location. Both histologies prove to be tumor-free in frozen section diagnostics. The pars membranacea of the trachea is then mobilized so that it can be mobilized cranially to complete the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Perform the voice prosthesis puncture with insertion of a size 8 Provox Vega voice prosthesis at the upper edge of the tracheostoma. Perform a myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle. The pharyngeal suture is then applied. The first layer forms a continuous Conley suture. An additional wound closure is made using the single-button technique. Insertion of the Redon suction drains on both sides. Folding back the apron flap. Completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis of the tracheostoma and double-layered suturing of the lateral wound edges. Finally, easy transfer of the patient to a 10-gauge Rügheimer cannula. Sterile wound dressing. Application of a pressure dressing. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Conclusion: Total laryngectomy with selective neck dissection on both sides. Primary voice rehabilitation by implantation of a Provox Vega 8 mm voice prosthesis with myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle.","Total laryngectomy, Selective bilateral neck dissection, Provox

Extension into the nasopharynx, just leaving out the tubal bulges. In addition, an isolated metastasis was found near the retropharyngeal tumor. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment was recommended.","First, after preparation and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, inspection of the primary tumor region by palpation and with the small bore tube. The largely submucosal, tumorous mass can be seen in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, directly adjacent to the retropharyngeal metastasis, which is now clearly progressive compared to CT imaging. Cranially, exophytic, exulcerated tumor part, palpatory just not reaching the tubal bulges. The tumor grows caudally to the border of the oropharynx and hypopharynx and takes up the entire width of the posterior wall of the oropharynx up to the lateral wall. Plastic tracheotomy is now performed for better exposure due to the extensive tumor. To do this, enter at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus and, after exposure, insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal clasps. Performing a visor tracheotomy. Incision in the usual manner and problem-free reintubation, initially on an 8 mm Woodbridge tube, later on an 8 mm low cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. First turn to the transoral procedure. Perform a left paramedian soft palate split. Good exposure of the nasopharyngeal part of the tumor for this. This ends well in front of the choanae and does not reach the tubal bulges on either side. Cut around the entire tumor. Perform a lateral tonsillectomy on both sides. Isolation of the tumor to the prevertebral fascia. Here the tumor is only moderately displaceable and has a large surface area. Due to the exposure, transition to the transcervical approach. For this purpose, a skin incision is made on the left side at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle with a slightly left paramedian tumor. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle while preserving the auricular nerve. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful preservation of the superior thyroid artery and the cervical artery. The facial vein is initially preserved, but is later removed during the transcervical procedure, as is the extremely strong occipital artery. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Free dissection of the internal jugular vein and clearing of level V while carefully preserving the cervical plexus branches. Subsequent resection of the digastric muscle, already directly connected to the enoral side. Widening of the pharyngotomy. Now exposure in depth. The tumor can be resected by removing the pharyngeal musculature. The prevertebral fascia only needs to be detached in a circumscribed manner. In this case, the resection distance is narrow, but macroscopically and palpatorily completely in sano, and there is also no evidence of perforation of the prevertebral fascia. Removal of the tumor now via transcervical. During mobilization, the nasopharnygeal portion is ruptured. For this reason, the tumor is sent in 2 parts ........ and a complete in-sano resection is also macroscopically present in the marginal area. The tumor is now completely imaged with marginal samples. All tumor........., tumor- and dysplasia-free, so that an R0 situation can be assumed. For the exposure of the tumor, the external and internal carotid arteries had to be visualized in a long-distance view. Extensive pharyngotomy. Therefore absolute indication for defect coverage using a free graft. Neck dissection of the right side should be performed first. In principle, the same procedure is used here. Expose the limiting musculature. Removal of the anterior neck preparation and preservation of the cervical artery, the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the nerves. No evidence of lymphatic leakage and dry wound conditions. Finally, exploration and cranial dissection of the external and internal carotid artery, in case of metastatic contact with the internal carotid artery on CT. This is completely explored. No further metastasis or tumor parts, so that the metastasis is also resected in toto. The defect is now measured. Decision to lift an anterolateral thigh graft from the right thigh. For this purpose, after doppler sonographic identification of 3 skin perforators, marking of a graft measuring 11 x 6 cm in total. Medial incision. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Cutting through the fascia lata. Exposing and securing the rectus femoris muscle. Strictly subfascial dissection. Exposure of the pedicle vessel. Performing the extension incision. Complete resection of the graft. A musculocutaneous perforator course is visible, therefore a narrow muscle cuff is included. Isolation on the vascular pedicle and placement of the vital graft in the area of the pedicle vessels. Careful hemostasis and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, multi-layer wound closure. Subsequently, combined transoral and transcervical insertion of the graft. Here, the suturing conditions were considerably more difficult and laborious. Finally, however, intact and tight conditions on all sides both cervically on both sides and nasopharyngeally. Suturing of the temporary soft palate cleft. Subsequent left-sided cervical pedicle positioning. First conditioning of the occipital artery. This shows extensive vascular damage to the intima. Further conditioning of the facial artery. Damage here too, but better conditions. Several suture attempts with 8-0 Ethilon are initially frustrating here, however, with rapid cessation of venous return flow. Subsequent conditioning of the submental artery. After suturing the artery, a sufficient circulation with proper flap vitality is now achieved, so that in vital conditions, after positioning the pedicle on both sides, the wound is irrigated and, in dry wound conditions, a 10 Redon drain is inserted and the wound is carefully closed. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected, extensive cT3 cN1 to 2a oropharyngeal carcinoma of the posterior pharyngeal wall with extension into the nasopharynx and hypopharynx. Extensive retropharyngeal metastasis adjacent to the tumor. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Sobelin 600 mg, which should be continued for 24 hours postoperatively. If the graft heals properly, a gradual increase in diet is possible from the 8th postoperative day. However, due to the extensive resection, a protracted recovery of the swallowing function is to be expected.","Pharyngectomy, Neck dissection, Pedicled flap (ALT)

Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. If diaphanoscopy is very good, regular puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG using the usual thread pull-through method. This is successful without any problems. Inconspicuous esophageal mucosa on reflection. Now insertion of the tonsil plug and inspection of the primary tumor region. Previously, palpation revealed a circumscribed induration of the right base of the tongue, but no more extensive infiltration. Inspection now revealed an exulcerated mass in the right tonsil region. From this exophytic mass, extensive erythroplakic changes extend towards the hard palate and parauvularly on the right, also in the area of the upper and lower alveolar ridge; in addition, extensions over the glossotonsillar groove towards the base of the tongue. In the area of the base of the tongue, there were renewed restless, exophytic changes, but not deeper on palpation. The tumor is now resected, partly monopolar, partly using the dissection technique. Left parauvular incision, taking the entire right-sided soft palate as far as the hard palate. Resection alveolar above, hard to the molars. Resection down to the alveolar ridge. Resection of the glossotonsillar groove and superficial resection of a good 1/3 of the base of the tongue. Removal of the tonsil region up to the transition to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Tumor extension towards the posterior pharyngeal wall is not visible. The specimen is completely thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. CIS in the area of the hard palate towards the alveolar ridge and buccal direction as well as CIS in the parauvular area in the area of the soft palate with otherwise free tumor margins and free basal margins are now visible. Post-resections are now performed in the respective areas, which are again marked with sutures for frozen section diagnostics. This again reveals CIS in the area of the alveolar ridge. Now perform another generous resection from the upper alveolar ridge over the entire buccal length to the lower alveolar ridge. A marginal sample is then taken over the same length, which is again marked with a suture for frozen section diagnostics and this time is assessed as tumor-free. Parallel to the tumor resection, a waisted graft measuring 13 x 6 cm is measured. Parallel procedure for neck dissection and tracheotomy: First tracheotomy. Horizontal skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Cut through. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection and clamping and transection of the thyroid isthmus. Further exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a Björk flap with a broad-based stalk and suturing of the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequent easy transfer to a tracheal tube. Then turn to neck dissection on the right: This is a condition following an unclear neck operation. Curved skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Pronounced scarring in the area of the previous operation. An external jugular vein can no longer be visualized here. Dissection of the subcutis and the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. If there is significant cranial scarring, it is difficult to expose the accessorius nerve. Exposure of the omohyoid and digastric muscles. Free preparation and exposure of the internal jugular vein with cervical vein. A very strong facial vein can be seen, which is preserved. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery and hypoglossal nerve. Now careful clearing of the accessory triangle. Exposure of the common carotid artery and vagus nerve and careful evacuation of level Vb while carefully preserving the plexus branches. All the structures mentioned were preserved during this procedure. Macroscopically, no suspicious lymph nodes were found. Later, the submandibular gland was extirpated. For this purpose, the gland is peeled out subcapsularly while carefully preserving the branch of the mouth. Detachment of the uncinate process and removal after transection of the duct. Now perform a partly blunt, partly preparatory pharyngotomy, approx. 2 transverse fingers wide. This is successful due to the already enoral resection. Now to lift the radialis graft from the left: After marking the graft, unwrap the arm and apply the tourniquet. Cutting around the graft and skin incision with lifting of a skin monitor. With a 13 cm long graft, relatively short distance between graft and monitor to maintain a largely flexible stem length. Now expose the cephalic vein. Follow and perform the Hayden maneuver and expose the superficial radial nerve ramus. Complete preservation of the nerve. After preservation of the nerve, strictly subfascial dissection and release of the radial portion of the flap. Now elevation further from the ulna. Strictly subfascial dissection. A superficial ulnar route is not visible. Identification and careful protection of the median nerve. Further strictly subfascial dissection with clipping of vessels close to the pedicle. This is successful without any problems. A strong fork between the cephalic vein and the strong cubital branch can be visualized in the antecubital region. After dissection of the pedicle, a clear anastomosis between the deep and superficial venous system can be visualized. Exposure and protection of the interosseous route. Reopening of the tourniquet. Immediate regular, somewhat hyperemic reperfusion of the flap with good perfusion of the skin monitor. Minutious hemostasis using clipping and bipolar coagulation. Now initially warming of the arm and the graft with simultaneous post-resection. Neck dissection is also performed on the left side. To do this, make a curved skin incision from the mastoid over the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the subcutis. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. An external jugular vein cannot be exposed here. Exposure and sparing of the auricular nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Evacuation of the anterior neck preparation with visualization and preservation of the cervical anus, artery and superior thyroid vein. Palpatory identification of the accessorius nerve. After exposing the cervical artery, expose the internal jugular vein. Free dissection reveals an internal jugular vein, which is double-lumened over a distance of approx. 4 cm. Here, branched inlets and a tear of an internal vessel are circumscribed. Vascular suture with 6.0 prolene. This succeeds without any problems. Further visualization. The internal jugular vein reunites approximately at the level of the hyoid and gives off a short but very strong facial branch anteriorly. Now follow the cervical vein posteriorly. Expose the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Protect the structures. Successive evacuation of level V while carefully protecting the plexus branches. Clearing of the accessory triangle after nerve exposure. Exposure and preservation of the accessorius............ Final inspection and, if the wound was dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. On the left side, there were macroscopically conspicuous lymph nodes in level IV and V. All these structures could be preserved. The vital graft was then removed and the radial flap was incorporated. For this purpose, traction from transcervical. Successive and relatively laborious incorporation with a strong radialis graft. This is sufficient in length. Finally, good fit, only in the area of the upper alveolar ridge there is an overlapping of the posterior molar by the graft due to the resections close to the mucosa, which cannot be completely prevented despite several attempts at suturing and repositioning. Otherwise good graft fit. Parallel to suturing, full-thickness skin was removed from the groin region on the right. A spindle-shaped graft measuring 14 x 7 cm was harvested for this purpose. Subcutaneous mobilization and, after insertion of a 10 Redon drain, multi-layer wound closure, which was successful under moderate, tension-free conditions. Cleaning of the graft and careful incorporation after two-layer wound closure of the forearm in the area of the lifting defect. If the fit is good, a VAC dressing is then applied. Finally, turn to the vascular anastomosis. Exposure and free preparation of the superior thyroid artery. Slightly more difficult positioning conditions in the area of the vascular pedicle, otherwise problem-free arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. With good reflux, preparation of a facial branch equivalent to a vein. After vessel preparation with very good reflux, problem-free venous anastomosis with a size III coupler. This was successful without any problems. Good reflux and regular flap and monitor perfusion. Now vessel positioning to protect against kinking. Careful wound inspection and finally meticulous hemostasis. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain with countersunk suture to protect the vascular pedicle and, after monitor adjustment, successive, careful two-layer wound closure and finally reintubation onto an 8-gauge cannula with inner core, which is sutured in place and the procedure is completed at this point without any indication of complications. Conclusion: After frozen section diagnosis R0-resected cT3 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Postoperatively, please monitor closely and regularly. Please monitor the findings in the area of the upper alveolar ridge. Post-operative X-ray pelvis recommended on the 8th postoperative day. If possible, the cannula should be left in place and sutured for 5 days.","Transoral tumor resection, PEG placement, Modified radical neck dissection (Level II-V bilaterally), Plastic tracheotomy, Defect coverage (Radial flap)

Unremarkable conditions in the trachea to carina area. Followed by transoral, endotracheal intubation. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon. A flexible esophagoscopy is performed using an endoscope, which is carefully advanced to the stomach under visualization. Inconspicuous conditions in the area of the entire oesophagus and stomach. Endoscopic inversion and inspection of the oesophago-gastric junction, with unremarkable findings. Retraction of the endoscope and performance of a rigid laryngo- and pharyngoscopy using a Kleinsasser C-tube. The endolarynx was completely unremarkable, the right piriform sinus, posterior wall of the hypopharynx and the postcricoidal region were unremarkable. In the area of the left piriform sinus and on its lateral wall, a tiny, spherical, exophytic mass covered by smooth mucosa was found, which was sent for an excisional biopsy for intraoperative frozen section examination. Subsequent inspection of the rest of the pharynx. The oropharyngeal region is completely normal. Samples are then taken from the right and left middle of the base of the tongue and hemostasis is performed using monopolar coagulation. Placement of the oral retractors and subsequent tonsillectomy, initially on the right side. Parauvular incision. Exposure of the upper pole. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Exposure of the correct layer, capsular approach from cranial to caudal while sparing the anterior and posterior palatal arch. Deposition of the tonsil preparation in its lower pole, hemostasis there using bipolar coagulation. Subsequently, identical procedure on the left side. Parauvular incision, exposure of the upper pole, hemostasis there using bipolar coagulation. Exposure of the right capsular layer, dissection along the tonsil capsule from cranial to caudal. Hemostasis in the caudal pole using bipolar coagulation and placement of the tonsil preparation in the lower pole. Dry conditions. The right tonsil and the sample from the left hypopharynx are sent for intraoperative frozen section. The remaining samples were sent for final histology. The intraoperative frozen section examination resulted in a positive finding (G3 squamous cell carcinoma) in the area of the left hypopharynx. The findings were adjusted using a Kleinsasser C-tube and the laser beam was set to a power of 4 watts in continuous mode. Moving around the findings using the CO2 laser. Removal of the sampling region in toto. Subsequently, 3 marginal samples (anterior wall of the piriform sinus, median wall of the piriform sinus, lateral wall of the piriform sinus) which are sent for final examination. Hemostasis there using monopolar coagulation. Removal of the Kleinsasser tube and subsequent repositioning of the patient for the planned neck dissection on the left side. Application of local anesthesia there after skin spray disinfection. Ablate the skin, sterile draping. Make an incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the accessorius nerve, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure cranial to the posterior venter of the digastric muscle. A large metastasis is already visible in this area. Dissection of the metastasis from the accessorius nerve, the internal jugular vein and the facial vein as well as from the posterior venter of the digaster muscle. Removal of the same in toto. Subsequent dissection along the cervical vascular sheath from caudal to cranial. Protection of the cervical vascular sheath structures. Successive removal of the posterior neck specimen while sparing the plexus branches. This revealed several metastases. Removal of the anterior neck specimen, where further metastases were found. Dry conditions. Treatment of region V with multiple ligatures to avoid a chyle fistula. Dry conditions. Wound irrigation with hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Repeated inspection.

In the panendoscopy performed <2015>, a tongue margin to tongue body carcinoma on the left was also confirmed clinically. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Then determination of the external tumor morphology using narrow-band imaging and contact endoscope. Targeted biopsies are taken to verify the narrow-band imaging images and the biopsies are sent for final histology. Then start with tumor resection with a safety margin of at least 1-1.5 cm in the area of the tongue. The carcinoma has extensions within the tongue that go beyond the midline in the area of the tip of the tongue and also extend to the underside of the tongue. The tumor is removed en bloc. Then take marginal samples directly from the specimen. The marginal samples are all tumor-free. Then perform the neck dissection on the left side. To do this, make a skin incision in a transverse skin fold. Separation of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma cranially. Exposure of the sternocleidomatoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland, the digastric muscle, the internal jugular vein and the facial vein as well as the external carotid artery, the facial artery and the superior thyroid artery. Clearing of neck levels IIa to Va while sparing the hypoglossal nerve, accessory nerve and plexus branches. The superior thyroid artery has an extremely small lumen. This is not suitable for a later graft connection. The facial artery and the facial vein are more suitable for this. Then work in parallel and perform the neck dissection on the right side through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Dictation: <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Locate the external jugular vein. This is ligated. Further dissection through the platysma and subplatysmal. Bluntly spread subplatysmal with the pedicle. Now locate the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissect the anterior border caudally. Anterior transection of the dermal fibers via region II b. Locate the accessorius nerve. Now expose the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid. Locate the submandibular gland and approach the capsule sharply. Pull up the gland with the Langenbeck and locate the digaster muscle. Blunt dissection with the clamp anteriorly and posteriorly on the digaster. Clear the triangle between the omohyoid and digaster anteriorly and the sternocleidomastoid and digaster posteriorly. The accessorius nerve can be spared at any time without any problems. Now dissect the medial neck triangle along the cervical nerve. Release the medial neck preparation. Dissection of the internal jugular vein in its entirety. Locate the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. When preparing the medial neck preparation, the superior thyroid vein is ligated. Now dissect the lateral neck preparation from cranial to caudal. The accessor nerve can also be spared here. The hypoglossal nerve is exposed and is also spared. Dissection in depth down to the cervical plexus. Levels II to IV are carefully dissected out. Hilus is not visible. The cervical sinus can be preserved. If there is no increased bleeding and the wound is free of irritation, hydrogen and ring irrigation, two-layer wound closure. Lifting of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and PJ. Marking of the graft on the forearm, then unwrapping of the graft and setting of the tourniquet. The graft is 9 x 6 mm in size and is incised. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle, exposure of the radial ramus superficialis nerve, which is divided into 2 branches. Exposure of the radial artery. Ligation and transection of the radial artery, then lifting of the graft from the tendons and dissection of the pedicle up to the antecubital fossa. There is good confluence between the superficial and deep venous system in the antecubital fossa. However, the cephalic vein could not be integrated into the graft as it is located too far laterally. Nevertheless, the part of the cephalic vein that lies proximal to the venous confluence is prepared for a connection and a further venous connection from the deep system. Deposition of the graft, then suturing of the graft in the tongue area. Reconstruction of the tip of the tongue by incising and suturing the graft to form a rounded tongue tip, which is adapted to the remaining tongue tip defect. During neck dissection, a tunnel was created to the tongue in the mouth area. The submandibular gland was removed and the digastric muscle was severed to create a passage 3 fingers wide. The stalk was guided outwards here. The radial artery was anastomosed to the facial artery and the veins to the facial vein and the second vein to a direct outlet from the internal jugular vein. A size 2.5 coupler was used for this. Finally, the tracheotomy was performed. For this, a skin incision was made below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection down to the musculature. Push the muscles aside. Enter the trachea between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage and create a muco-cutaneous anastomosis. Re-intubation to an 8 mm tracheal cannula. If the flap is well perforated, the patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics for 24 hours. Nutrition for 10 days via the PEG tube, then if necessary, X-ray pre-swallow and cautious diet build-up.","Transoral tumor resection, Modified radical neck dissection, and Tracheotomy

Sonography showed a cN 2c neck status directly preoperatively, the CT scan performed showed no evidence of distant metastasis.","First start with the PEG insertion. Entering with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. If diaphanoscopy is good and the stomach has been punctured without any problems, the PEG tube is inserted using the usual thread pull-through method. After repositioning the patient, turn to pharyngoscopy and inspect the primary tumor. There is an exophytic process in the area of the right tonsil, which partially reaches the soft palate via the anterior palatal arch and the posterior palatal arch. Right-sided subtotal infiltration and consumption of the uvula. Infiltration of the base of the uvula on the left side, macroscopically on the right side, right caudally, not exceeding the tonsil lobe, also palpatorily no indication of deep infiltration in the cervical direction. The tumor is now resected with partial soft palate resection with a safety margin of approx. 1.5 cm. Release of the tumorously altered tonsil with lateral preservation of a soft tissue mantle. Complete removal of the posterior palatal arch, also here removal of muscles on all sides. Deposition at the lower tonsil pole. Inspection reveals a macroscopically and palpatorily clearly resected tumor in sano. The specimen is thread-marked on all sides for frozen section diagnostics and is diagnosed here as a squamous cell carcinoma resected in sano. Inspection of the defect. There is a clear soft palate in the defect. Approximately 2 cm of the soft palate have been subtotally resected. Subtotal resection of the posterior palatal arch so that the defect in the area of the tonsillar lobe is resected. Measurement of a 0.5 x 4.5 cm graft with separate logging for the soft palate. The neck is first dissected on the left side. To do this, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein, which is very slender here. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of a strong transcervical vein. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery as well as the cervical artery and the hypoglossal nerve. A very strong anterior jugular vein can be seen here. A true facial vein is not present here. Some of the sides of the anterior jugular vein are ligated, but overall it is preserved as a vessel. The vein takes up the submandibular region via the lateral branches. The branches are also preserved here. Complete exposure of the digastric muscle. Exposure and free preparation of the internal jugular vein while carefully preserving the vessel. Exposure of the accessory nerve. Level 2 shows a hardened palpable lymph node measuring approx. 2.5 x 1.5 cm on the internal jugular vein. Macroscopically quite suspicious, but without perinodal and nodal growth. Finally, evacuation of the accessorius triangle with careful protection and evacuation of level 5 with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches as well as caudal dry conditions without lymph vessel alteration. Final wound inspection with dry conditions on palpation. No further masses, no bleeding. Wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drainage, careful two-layer wound closure. The neck dissection of the right side is now carried out in parallel and the radialis graft is lifted for neck dissection. Basically the same procedure as on the opposite side. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue along the anterior edge of the muscle. Expose and cut through the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and auricular nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Visualization of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation, carefully preserving the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. The size and shape of the lymph nodes are conspicuous in level 2 and in the transition to level 3, so that the cN2c neck status can be confirmed intraoperatively. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Evacuation of level 5 with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. There is also no true facial vein on the right side. Strong upper thyroid branch. This is prepared for later anastomization, and the superior thyroid artery is also dissected, although it is relatively slender, so the faciliac artery is also prepared. The carotid artery is now dissected cranially after removal of the digastric muscle. Dissection up to the styloid, then the pharyngotomy can be performed in the area of the tonsillar lobe by transoral control. Widen the pharyngotomy, taking the surrounding muscles with it. This results in a tunnel a good two transverse fingers wide. Now to lift the radialis graft. After marking the graft, identify the radial artery by palpation and the cephalic vein. Perform the tourniquet. Cut around the graft. Radial start. Exposure of the cephalic vein. Exposure of the brachialis muscle. Exposure of the Haydn maneuver. Exposure and securing of the superficial ramus, radial nerve. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle. Blunt cutting of the vascular pedicle distally after ligation, strictly subfascial release. After complete exposure of the brachioradialis muscle with isolation and removal of the cephalic vein. Inappropriate dissection, exposure and dissection of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. Exclusion of a superficial ulnar artery. Complete release of the graft with careful clipping of outgoing vessels. Isolation on the vascular pedicle with the radial artery and accompanying veins as well as additional elevation of the strong cephalic vein. Expose a strong bridge of the accompanying veins to the cephalic vein and, if the accompanying vein is relatively confluent, take the bridge branch and isolate it on the cephalic vein after clipping the remaining branches of the outgoing veins. Exposure of the branch of the radial artery. Exposure of the outlet of the anterior interosseous artery and the powerful ulnar artery. Both vessels are left intact and spared. Re-opening of the tourniquet with uterine hemostasis with a vital, regular graft and regular blood supply to the hand. Finally, after careful hemostasis in the case of a vital graft, the graft is removed. Subsequent careful two-layer wound closure. Removal of the full-thickness skin graft from the groin and final application of a vacuum sealing bandage and the cramp splint in the functional position and repositioning of the arm. For full-thickness skin harvesting from the groin on the right, mark a full-thickness skin graft measuring a good 10 x 5 cm. Cut around the skin with strict cutaneous elevation. Careful subcutaneous mobilization. Meticulous hemostasis and careful multi-layer wound closure under moderate tension after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. The radialis graft is now inserted transcervically. Gradual insertion of the graft under soft palate reconstruction and doubling of the graft. Careful insertion of the tonsil lobe. Finally, dense conditions and good adaptation conditions. Microscopic conditioning of the pedicle vessels, very strong radial artery and strong cespal vein. First conditioning of the superior thyroid artery. A very slender vessel can now be seen here, even after removal, so that the superior thyroid artery is clipped. Dissection of the facial artery. ......... of the vessel. Moderate difference in caliber with further caliber advantage of the radial artery. Conditioning of the vessels and successive caliber-adapted anastomization with 8.0 Ethilon, this is laborious, but finally succeeds well and adequately with immediate regular venous return and regular flap perfusion. Now conditioning of the superior thyroid vein in order to achieve some degree of caliber equivalence, this must be placed relatively close to the internal jugular vein. Measure a coupler of size 3.0 and perform the venous anastomosis with the coupler. Immediate regular venous return after reopening of the artery, regular perfusion with regular pedicle pulsation and good graft perfusion. Multiple inspections. Enoral conditions remain lean, therefore a defect limited to the tonsillar lobe and the soft palate is avoided, a tracheostomy is not performed and the procedure is terminated after the patient has been repositioned. The patient received intraoperative i.V. antibiotic treatment with Unacid 3 g. This should be continued for 24 hours and a single-shot administration of 250 mg SDH to prevent swelling. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT2 cN2c oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. From the 8th postoperative day onwards, with a properly healing graft and dense conditions, a gradual increase in diet is possible. Postoperatively, please monitor the flap meticulously by enoral inspection. Note: On the right cervical side, the course of the pedicle is relatively close to the subcutaneous level of the carotid bulb. Please strictly avoid pressure bandages here and exercise caution when opening if necessary.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), PEG placement

CT showed no evidence of distant metastasis, no evidence of osseous infiltration.","After preparation and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, a pharyngo-laryngoscopy was performed to determine the current extent of the tumor. A coarse exulcerated tumor of the right tonsillar lobe was found, here coarsely seated and not displaceable. Infiltration of the soft palate also submucosal to parauvular on the right. Growth up to the dorsal maxilla. Growth circumscribed to the alveolar ridge. Growth to buccal over the glossotonsillar groove and the posterior floor of the mouth. Infiltration of the edge of the tongue and also the base of the tongue, here about Ľ infiltrated. Posterior palatal arch is reached. Also the caudal, former tonsil pole. No further tumor growth further caudally. Ultrasonography shows a cN2b neck status with infiltration of the internal jugular vein. The tumor is now resected transorally. Incision of the tumor with a safety margin of a good 1 cm and subtotal removal of the soft palate. Resection up to the left tonsil lobe. Subtotal removal of the soft palate. Resection up to the cheek. Exposure of the maxillary bone. Removal of the last gingival pocket and thus pushing the tumor away from the maxilla, which is growing close here, but certainly not breaking through the periosteum. The same procedure is now performed on the mandibular branch via the buccal side. View of the ascending mandibular branch. The tumor grows here, but does not reach the periosteum. From the inside, pushing off the periosteum in the posterior region. Close growth to the periosteum. Here the entire periosteum is pushed away from the posterior mandible, resulting in a good solution. A clear infiltration of the pharyngeal musculature can now be seen in depth. This is resected subtotally. Growth up to the pterygoid musculature. Circumscribed infiltration here. Overall, however, good mobilization of the tumour, so that the tumour can be mobilized cranially after detachment of the musculature with a clear safety margin. Resection of the posterior floor of the mouth and the edge of the tongue, maintaining a safety margin of 1 ˝ cm in the area of the tongue. Removal of the tumor in the area of the tongue down to the base of the tongue. It can now be seen that the tumor has broken through to the cervical region via the posterior floor of the mouth and laterally via the base of the tongue. Partial infiltration of the submandibular gland, which is already visualized enorally. Exposure of the lingual nerve, which is broad anteriorly but clearly infiltrated by the tumor dorsally. This is later removed. Due to the growth, the decision was made to proceed with a combined procedure and further transcervical resection. Therefore, repositioning for neck dissection of the right side. Curved skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle with careful preservation of the extremely strong external jugular vein. A clear infiltration of the muscle by the metastasis located in level II can already be seen in the upper area of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Clear infiltration. Now caudal visualization of the entire sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Separation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and cranial dissection. A markedly coarsely growing mass is seen in levels II and III, with a structure that most closely resembles a soft tissue metastasis. The internal jugular vein is now visualized. Cranial dissection. The vein is also clearly infiltrated in the middle area. The vein is therefore removed after securing the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Cranial dissection. The accessor nerve can be found below the trapezius muscle, but is clearly infiltrated medially and is also resected later. The metastasis grows close to the carotid bulb. The superior thyroid artery can be secured. The lingual artery must be removed later if the tumor grows, as must the facial artery. Careful dissection in the area of the bulb. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Careful dissection of the nerve, the carotid bulb and the hypoglossal nerve can be preserved at the end. Securing the internal carotid artery. Certainly no tumor growth here, the rest of the external carotid artery is again free. A small tumor cone can now be dissected on the carotid artery in the direction of the primary tumor. Careful release of the cone. Removal of all surrounding tissue. Cranial removal of the internal jugular vein. The tumor cone can be followed towards the posterior floor of the mouth. Release of the submandibular gland, which is not infiltrated in the caudal part. Perform the pharyngotomy via the extirpation of the submandibular gland. Extend the pharyngotomy and complete the tumor resection, including the infiltrated floor of the mouth, and include the base of the tongue, resecting a good 1/3 of the base of the tongue. Overall, there is a clear breakthrough into the muscles of the floor of the mouth via the base of the tongue and the posterior floor of the mouth, resulting in a cT4a finding. The entire tumor specimen is thread-marked in toto with adjacent soft tissue metastasis for definitive histology. Enorally, all mucosal margins are provided with margin samples. This shows an R0 resection for the invasive carcinoma on all sides. Only the area of the floor of the mouth shows circumscribed CIS. Therefore, a generous resection and a new margin sample were performed here. Here, too, CIS was suspected, so that after a further resection a final specimen was taken, which was then assessed in the frozen section as completely free of tumor and dysplasia, so that overall an R0 resection with extensive growing cT4a oropharyngeal carcinoma with breakthrough and metastasis per continuitatem in the soft tissues of the neck can be assumed. The neck dissection is now completed. This involves clearing out level V while carefully sparing the cervical plexus branches. Also clear and complete level I b. Here too, several nodes measuring up to just under 2 cm. If the wound is dry, neck dissection of the left side and elevation of the radialis graft from the right forearm are now performed in parallel. Neck dissection of the left side. To do this, make a curved skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Dissection of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. This shows a macroscopically suspicious mass in the jugulofacial angle, but without infiltration of the surrounding tissue. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Excision of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and excision of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Final wound inspection. In dry conditions, wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and in dry wound conditions, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Now to elevate the radialis graft. After marking the graft measuring up to 13 x 10 cm in total with a special configuration for the base of the tongue, floor of the mouth and soft palate. Creation of the tourniquet. Trimming of the graft. First radial preparation. This shows that the cephalic vein lies very far dorsally in the area of origin and is not in contact with the graft over a long distance, so that the cephalic vein does not need to be included. Exposure of the superficial radial nerve ramus, which can be completely spared. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle. Dissection of the vascular pedicle. Ulnar dissection. Strictly subfascial release of the graft, leaving the peritendineum intact. Subsequent cranial dissection of the pedicle utilizing the entire pedicle position and left-sided anastomosis. A strong venous confluence can be seen here. Reopening of the tourniquet. A properly perfused graft is visible. Careful hemostasis and later removal of the graft after ligation of the vessel leading to ................ Subsequently, with dry wound conditions, careful, two-layer wound closure and harvesting of the full-thickness skin graft taken from the right groin. The vacuum pump is then applied and the Kramer splint is placed in the functional position. Removal of the full-thickness skin graft. To do this, cut around an area measuring 16 x 7.5 cm in total. Wider lifting is not possible due to increased skin tension. Incision of the graft. Strictly cutaneous lifting. Subcutaneous mobilization down to the fascia lata and the abdominal fascia. Subsequent insertion of a 10 Redon drain in dry wound conditions and multi-layer, subcutaneous wound closure and skin suturing. To incorporate the graft. For this purpose, combined transoral and transcervical suturing is performed using partially placed sutures. Difficult suturing conditions in the upper and lower jaw area. However, overall good fit, especially in the area of the caudal pharynx and the base of the tongue. Resection extending into the vallecula. Overall adequate fit here. In the meantime, the tracheotomy was performed. Horizontal skin incision at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and incision of the tracheostoma in the typical manner. Subsequently, transfer to a size 8 low-cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. The cervical vessels are now prepared. The lingual artery is no longer sufficiently pervious or has an inadequate flow after the tube is removed, so the superior thyroid artery is now prepared. Excellent flow here. Preparation of the graft vessels. Then perform the arterial anastomosis with 8-0 Ethilon. This works relatively well even with unequal vessel calibers. Good adaptation. After reopening the blood flow, regular venous return flow and good pedicle pulsation immediately. Now prepare the external jugular vein. This is seen cranially with a questionably discrete thrombus. Open the vein. After removing a small amount of thrombotic material, excellent reflux, so that after measuring a size 3.0 coupler, anastomosis is performed with the coupler system. Subsequent regular circulation. Positive spreading phenomenon and regular pedicle pulsation as well as regular graft perfusion, so that after final wound inspection and wound irrigation with Ringer's solution, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and subsequent careful, two-layer wound closure. Final inspection of the graft and, if the graft is vital, termination of the procedure at this point. Conclusion: Intraoperatively R0-resected, extremely aggressive growing cT4a cN2c oropharyngeal carcinoma with perifocal CIS and metastasis per continuitatem in the soft tissues of the neck. Due to the resected surrounding musculature, a prolonged recovery of swallowing function can be expected. If the graft heals properly, the first clinical swallowing diagnostics can be carried out from the 9th postoperative day, followed by a diet if necessary. Due to tumor growth, adjuvant radiochemotherapy is urgently indicated.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect reconstruction, Free flap (Radial)

In the panendoscopy performed <2013>, no primary for the cervical lymph node metastasis on the right could be seen, whereupon a PET-CT was performed. This revealed a tumor-specific mass in the area of the right tonsil. In addition, several conspicuous mediastinal lymph nodes and also highly suspicious cervical lymph nodes on the left. Hence the indication for the above-mentioned procedure. The course of the operation and the neck dissection on the left side were previously discussed with <CLINICIAN_NAME>.","Induction of anesthesia by the anesthesiologist. Nasal intubation by the anesthetist. Insertion of the tonsil blocker and inspection of the tonsil boxes. The tonsil lobe on the left side looks completely unremarkable, on the right side a rough mass of approx. 1 to 2 cm can be felt. It is therefore decided to resect the right tonsil with a sufficient safety margin. Incision of the mucosa with the monopolar needle, then change to the scissors. Dissection of the mass, taking the entire tonsil with the dissection technique using scissors and bipolar forceps. The specimen is thread-marked for histology. The frozen section shows a T1 squamous cell carcinoma, which was completely resected in sano. Modified radical neck dissection on the left (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Initially skin spray disinfection. Infiltration anesthesia along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Abjoration of the skin and sterile draping. Creation of a skin incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Dissection of the same in an anterior cranial direction. Exposure of the digaster muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Subsequent successive dissection along the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the vagus nerve and the common carotid artery. Development of the neck preparation from cranial to caudal. In the area of region II b, a large, coarse mass with a maximum diameter of approx. 2 cm with a clear suspicion of metastasis is visible. Exposure and sparing of the branches of the cervical plexus. Exposure and sparing of the hypoglossal nerve and the superficial cervical nerve. Subsequent dissection of the anterior cervical vascular sheath and removal of the anterior neck specimen. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation using hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Repeated wound inspection. Completely dry conditions. Placement of a 10 Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure and completion of the neck dissection on the left side without complications. Neck dissection on the right side: The large N3 neck metastasis is located here, it comprises levels II to IV and palpatorily also level V. Sonographically, the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein are infiltrated and can no longer be delimited. First skin incision and creation of a platysmal flap. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. It can be clearly seen that the tumor completely infiltrates the muscle in the middle area as well as in the upper area where the accessorius nerve enters the muscle. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is set off at the lower edge. It can also be seen that the jugular vein runs through the tumor and is already completely thrombosed. The vein is cut off at the lower edge and removed. Exposure of the common carotid artery, which can be pushed away from the tumor, and dissection of the neck metastasis cranially. The upper area shows that the facial artery and the facial vein are also infiltrated; unfortunately, these must also be removed. Further triggering of the metastasis. After visualization of the posterior abdomen of the digaster, the hypoglossal nerve was also found to be infiltrated. After intraoperative consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, this is resected together with the tumor conglomerate. Now complete dissection of the internal carotid artery. It becomes clear that the external carotid artery is also infiltrated. The external carotid artery is removed after the superior thyroid artery has been removed and ligated. The metastasis can be retrieved in its entirety. Then complete the neck dissection in level V, sparing the remaining plexus branches. A few smaller lymph nodes could still be retrieved here. Clearing out the remaining level II b. Level I b and the submandibular gland can be preserved. The external jugular vein could also be preserved, although it is very thin. Conclusion: cT1 cN3 tonsillar carcinoma on the right, resected in sano according to the frozen section. On the right side, the following structures were removed by tumor infiltration: sternocleidomastoid muscle, internal jugular vein, external carotid artery, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. After receiving the final histology, the patient should be presented at the tumor conference to discuss adjuvant radiochemotherapy or radiotherapy, also with regard to the conspicuous mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.","Tumor tonsillectomy, Radical neck dissection

The above-mentioned surgery was therefore indicated.,"First, pharyngoscopy again. The exophytic tumor is seen, which is located in the pharyngeal side wall and in the piriform sinus on the front right and is fixed to the hemilarynx on the right. Confirmed in conjunction with CT above mentioned surgery. Patient was also informed about the use of a radial flap to cover the defect if necessary. First injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both parts of the neck. Then sterile draping. Create the apron flap subplatysmally in the typical manner. Veins are bipolized and ligated. Dissection of the apron flap up to the level of the hyoid bone or the submandibular gland. Then neck dissection modified radical right: exposure of the digastric muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. V. jugularis interna, A. carotis interna and externa. Exposure of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. The latter must be pushed away from the tumor block, which is successful. Subsequent evacuation level II-V while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Neck preparation can be dissected away from the tumor, no per continuitatem growth. The upper pole of the thyroid gland was removed with the tumor specimen, the lower edge parts can be preserved, the thyroid gland was treated with puncture ligation. The superior thyroid artery was cut and ligated. Then modified radical neck dissection on the left: Basic procedure in the same way as on the left side. Exposure of the digastric muscle and omohyoid muscle here too. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein. Depiction of the common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery. Depiction of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. All structures can be well preserved. A. thyroidea superior is dissected long towards the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is deposited at the isthmus in such a way that a cystic nodule in the isthmus area is deposited together with the tumor specimen, with puncture ligatures on both adjacent sides. Exposure of the trachea. Evacuation of levels II-IV and parts of V. Retention of the branches of the cervical plexus. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Now tumor resection: separation of the infrahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone. Exposure of the upper horn of the thyroid cartilage on the left and dissection of the pharyngeal tube. Release of the piriform sinus. This is not possible on the right due to tumor growth. Thyroid gland is displaced caudo-laterally on both sides with exposure of the trachea from the side. Entry into the larynx on the left paramedian side after exposure of the epiglottis. The exophytic tumor is visible. This is resected on all sides with a safety margin of approx. 1.5-2 cm. Inclusion of the entire pharyngeal musculature. The upper pole of the thyroid gland is integrated into the tumor preparation. Left mucosa-sparing procedure as far as possible. Release of the larynx. Separation of the larynx from the trachea under incision, which extends the trachea cranially. Send in the entire specimen marked with sutures. Also send in 2 marginal samples in the cranial area mucosal marginal sample and cranio-basal. The entire specimen was removed in the healthy area. The cranial mucosal margin sample and the cranio-basal soft tissue margin sample are also healthy, thus R0 status. Overall, there is a defect extending not far from the esophageal entrance; cranially, the defect is connected to parts of the pharyngeal wall. Inspection revealed the possibility of closing the pharynx without a flap, hence the decision to proceed with this procedure. Myotomy first. A tear in the mucosa is seen slightly above the myotomy, which must be sutured. Inconspicuous conditions in the area of the myotomy. This improves the passage. Due to the overall tight mucosal conditions and the mucosal tear near the myotomy, a Provox prosthesis insertion is not performed intraoperatively in this case. The pharyngeal suture is performed. The first layer is performed between the remaining remnants of the pharyngeal wall and the adjacent tongue base tissue. This is done in two layers. The remaining pharyngeal mucosa can now be adapted to create a T-shaped suture. Inverting suture as the first suture. Then 2nd suture on top so that all layers are sutured in two layers. Sutures each with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Third suture cannot be performed as there are no pharyngeal muscle remnants on the right. Hyoid bone was removed cranially to reduce tension. Infrahyoid musculature is sutured to the remains of the suprahyoid musculature using several adaptation sutures. Careful irrigation of the wound area again with H202 and Ringer's solution and careful hemostasis. At the end, the site is free of bleeding. Wound closure in layers and insertion of a Redon drain into both sides of the neck and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Finally, insertion of a 10 mm tracheostomy tube. The procedure was completed without complications. Patient transferred to intensive care unit for monitoring. Please continue intraoperative antibiotics with Unacid for 2-3 days. Keep the patient fasting for 10 days, then swallow gruel and, if necessary, build up diet. Nutrition in the meantime via the inserted PEG tube. Please leave the feeding tube in place. If the healing process is normal, a Provox prosthesis can then be inserted secondarily. Overall cT4a cN2c hypopharyngeal carcinoma with invasion of the larynx. After laryngectomy and partial pharyngectomy, direct closure in borderline but low-tension conditions.

Tumor is visible in the direction of the hypopharynx. Confirmation of the indication. Initial PEG placement using the thread pull-through method. With very good diaphanoscopy, this is successful without any problems. Then skin disinfection of all relevant surgical areas and sterile draping. Then start with neck dissection on both sides: Neck dissection on the right (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Separation of the platysma and subplatysmal dissection. Exposure of the anterior border of the MSCM and identification and preservation of the accessory nerve. Tracing of the omohyoid muscle and visualization of the. Gl. submandibularis. Visualization of the posterior venter of the digastric muscle. A large metastasis is seen in region Ib/II, which is located directly on the internal jugular vein. Dissection of the VJI and careful dissection of the metastasis. Ligation of a large branch of the VJI in order to be able to use it later for the venous anastomosis. Ligation of the V. Facialis for the same reason, exposure and preservation of the ACI, ACC and ACE as well as the vagus nerve and the cervical artery. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve. Now successive removal of the lateral and medial neck preparation, i.e. from region Ib to V while preserving the plexus branches. Dissection of the superior thyroid artery and the facial artery in order to be able to use them later for the microvascular anastomosis Neck dissection on the left: Sharp dissection of the skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the digaster muscle, the accessorius nerve and the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath with the internal jugular vein and facial vein, ACC, ACI, ACE, vagus nerve, cervical plexus and subsequent removal of the neck preparation from level II to IV without complications and with preservation of all the structures mentioned. Insertion of a Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure, first of the platysma and then of the skin. Subsequent combined transcervical, transoral tumor resection: First dissection of the large neck vessels from the pharyngeal tube. Small outgoing vessels are ligated or treated. Snaring of the internal carotid artery, external carotid artery and common carotid artery as well as snaring of the hypoglossal nerve. V. facialis is placed cranially. The lingual artery is ligated and double ligated in the direction of the external carotid artery. Pharyngeal tube is dissected free towards the base of the skull. Border cord is preserved. Subsequent resection of the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1.5 to 2 cm on all sides, whereby the entire pharyngeal wall is resected in each case. The uvula with soft and hard palate on the right, the entire tonsil lobe, the mucosa at the transition to the base of the tongue, a lateral part of the base of the tongue to the medial side and the posterior palatal arch of the medial pharyngeal wall are resected. The resection is then completed from the outside, whereby both parts of the base of the tongue, the vallecula, upper parts of the arytenoid fold and the medial and anterior as well as small parts of the lateral piriform sinus wall must also be resected. The tumor is marked using sutures. In addition, marginal samples are taken from the lateral pharyngeal wall caudal to the right of the piriform sinus, from the lateral right arytenoid area and from the medial arytenoid area to the edge of the epiglottis. In the frozen section, all marginal samples were tumor-free as well as the specimen. In the cranial area, a resection is recommended again for safety reasons, therefore a strip several mm in size is taken from the soft palate to hard palate area up to the lateral alveolar ridge, here a thread-marked specimen is taken and sent for frozen section. There were no tumor infiltrates either in the mucosa or in the soft tissue, not even in the additional soft tissue removed. So now R0 resection. Defect size is measured at 12 to 13 x 8 to 9 cm. Marking on the forearm according to the required three-dimensional configuration. Subsequent removal of the radial artery flap <CLINICIAN_NAME>: skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Locate and expose the cephalic vein and small venous anastomoses. Preparation of the pedicle between the brachioradialis muscle and the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Exposure of the venous star. Now successive further dissection of the pedicle and clipping of perforating vessels. Trimming of the 14x8cm graft. Ulnar subfascial dissection with identification and preservation of the ulnar artery and nerve. Now radial incision and radial dissection of the cephalic vein. Separation of several venous outlets by means of ligation. Separation of the cephalic vein distally. Locate the radial nerve R superficialis and preserve it. A small branch is pulled into the flap and removed. Careful further preparation of the remaining graft. After the R0 tumor has been resected, the graft is removed. Subsequent insertion of the radial flap into the defect and vascular suture: After the radial flap has been removed, rinse thoroughly with plenty of heparin. Insertion of the flap into the defect. Successive suturing of the flap with 3-0 Vicryl single-button sutures, partly with caudal and then cranial exposure. The flap fits very well into the defect and fulfills the three-dimensional requirement. The flap is then connected to the vessels. The superior thyroid artery is selected as the arterial vessel. After conditioning the vessels, suture with 9-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. Subsequent dissection of the V. thyroidea media and a branch of the V. facialis. The V. thyroidea media is anastomosed to the one outlet in the area of the V. cephalica using a 2.5 mm coupler after conditioning the vessels. Good venous return after opening the clips, positive smear phenomenon. The other outlet from the cephalic vein is then anastomosed with an outlet from the facial vein. Here too, after opening the clamps, the smear phenomenon is positive. Then clip all other available venous outlets. Careful hemostasis and irrigation. Wound closure in layers on both sides of the neck, on the right with insertion of a Redon drain, on the left with insertion of 2 flaps. Thorough inspection of the flap, which is vital. Removal of split skin + wound closure of the forearm: At the same time, large areas of split skin are removed from the right thigh in the usual manner. Application of sterile wound dressing in the area of the donor site. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of graft elevation without complications. Tracheostoma creation: A horizontal incision of about 4 cm 2 QF is made above the jugulum, sharply cutting through the skin, subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. The prelaryngeal musculature or infrahyoid musculature is exposed, entered in the midline and the thyroid gland is exposed. Dissection of the trachea between the cricoid cartilage and isthmus. The isthmus is cut and stitched on both sides. No major bleeding. Between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasp, the trachea is entered and a visor tracheotomy is created. The mucocutaneous anastomosis is created cranially and caudally. The patient is then intubated using an 8-gauge cannula. Completion of the procedure without complications. Then reintubation and insertion of an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube. The procedure is completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Please leave heparin perfusor running at 1 ml/h for a further 5 days. Flap control via enoral inspection for 5 days according to schedule. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube for 10-12 days, then X-ray pre-swallow and, if necessary, diet build-up.

Inconspicuous mucosa in the area of the endolarynx and the epiglottis as well as the interary area. Now insertion of the Mc Ivor oral spatula and demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. A rough mass was found in the area of the left tonsil, which, however, remained limited to the tonsil lobe. The anterior and posterior palatal arch do not appear to be infiltrated, nor does the base of the tongue. In the rest of the oropharynx and in the oral cavity, inconspicuous mucosal conditions. The tumor is now macroscopically excised in toto in the sense of an extended tonsillectomy using a dissection technique with a sufficient safety margin while sparing the posterior palatal arch. The tumor specimen is thread-marked for histology. A resection is then taken in the area of the wound bed and the entire area is covered with margin samples. These are sent separately for final histology. Finally, subtle hemostasis using H2O2-soaked swabs and bipolar coagulation. Finally, dry mucosal conditions and completion of the procedure without complications. Repositioning of the patient by the surgeon. Conclusion: Overall macroscopic in sano resection of a cT2 tonsillar carcinoma on the left. There is a very small defect in the left oropharyngeal side wall.

Now presentation with suspected carcinoma. At the last MLE, a squamous cell carcinoma of the right vocal fold was confirmed. This was described as being located in the anterior part of the right vocal cord up to the anterior commissure.","After intubation of the patient, MLE is now performed: the thickened vocal fold is visible, especially on the right, up to the anterior commissure. Overall, the tumor also appears to be growing into the ventriculus laryngeus. Overview difficult due to the poor adjustability, therefore, due to the overall situation, the decision was made to perform the operation by means of partial laryngeal resection from the outside. Therefore now repositioning. Injection of a total of 8 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline. Sterile draping. Zigzag skin incision. Exposure of the larynx. Creation of a perichondrium flap from the left side. Then opening of the larynx, whereby a triangle is cut out more on the right than on the left with the wheel. The larynx is then opened. Entering the larynx from the supraglottic side. Now inspect the tumor. Cut around the tumor or the visible thickenings and palpable thickenings with a safety margin of at least 4 mm on all sides. The entire vocal fold up to the arytenoid area on the right, the mucosa up to the upper edge of the cricoid cartilage, the entire area of the pouch ligament. The tumor, including the perichondrium, is removed from the right side after it has been dissected away from the cartilage, as well as from the front left side, whereby the anterior vocal fold is also resected macroscopically in the anterior part of the healthy area. Resection caudally up to the ligamentum conicum. Tumor is marked with sutures. Samples are taken from the supraglottic margin and the basal anterior margin. In the frozen section at the border of the supraglottic to the arytenoid region or the arytenoid region to the subglottic region, the tumor forms a margin. Also in the area of the vocal fold on the front left. A resection is performed on the left side, which includes the supraglottic, glottic and subglottic areas and is sent in marked with sutures. The sutures are all remote from the tumor. Also post-resection dorsal right and subglottic right. A marginal sample is then taken from subglottic and dorsal in the arytenoid region. Here in the first post-resection supraglottic left still clear carcinoma infiltrates, glottic and subglottic none. In the direction of the arytenoid region, there is a tumor, although metaplasia is also possible. Post-resection is therefore also recommended here. Overall, the resection in the arytenoid region on the right has already progressed to the interary area. Further massive removal of the mucosa is not possible without functional damage. Therefore, mucosa is removed from the arytenoid region in the dorsal area and subglottically only as a resection. In addition, an extensive resection is performed in the glottic and supraglottic area on the left, whereby the sutures are placed remote from the tumor. Ultimately, a vocal fold remnant remains on the left, supraglottic mucosal remnant on the left. Overall, the situation is now borderline. In principle, there is also a suspicion of field carcinomatization with an overall macroscopically invisible tumour extension. Now laryngeal closure. Creation of drill holes and 2 Vicryl sutures, which adapt the cartilage. Perichondrium is sutured over the laryngeal cartilage defect or over the laryngeal cartilage. The muscle layer is sutured over this. A further layer of soft tissue is then applied. The skin is then closed in layers with the insertion of a flap. A tracheostoma was also created via a slightly deeper, small Kocher collar incision. The trachea was first exposed by dissecting through the subcutaneous tissue. The thyroid isthmus was cut and ligated beforehand. A modified Björk flap is then created, which has a wide stalk. The tracheostoma is then epithelialized in the typical manner. An 8 mm tracheostomy tube is then inserted. Overall, the procedure is completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Overall borderline situation as far as partial laryngeal resection is concerned. No further resection can be performed, particularly in the direction of the interary space, without the interary region shrinking and leading to respiratory distress. If tumor residues are still present, a laryngectomy should be discussed in any case. Even in an R0 situation, the situation is borderline, so that a laryngectomy would ultimately be the safest option for long-term survival. Postoperative nutrition via a nasogastric tube if necessary.","Partial laryngeal resection according to Leroux-Robert, Tracheostomy, MLE (Microlaryngoscopy and Endoscopy)

The patient still needed time to think about the planned laryngectomy and partial pharyngectomy and a second opinion. Therefore, the above-mentioned procedure was performed, as the patient was ultimately able to decide on the operation, but wanted the operation in <LOCATION>.","First, induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Intubation was very difficult and only possible orally with great difficulty, then sterile washing and draping, prior inspection with the small water tube and visualization of the tumor, the tumor is located on the medial wall of the piriform sinus and extends to the aryepiglottic fold and the arytenoid cartilage on the left side. The tumor is exophytic and affects the entire left medial and anterior wall of the piriform sinus; the tip of the piriform sinus and the esophageal entrance are tumor-free. A PEG is now inserted using the suture pull-through method with good diaphanoscopy. Then sterile washing and draping and creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Then release of the larynx and detachment of the neck vessel sheath on both sides. Release of the piriform sinus on the right side, this is successful without any problems. Then only very slight and partial release of the piriform sinus on the left side, then release of the hyoid bone and performance of the tracheotomy in the usual manner directly below the cricoid cartilage. Then perform the pharyngoscopy. To do this, enter with the Hartmann spatula directly above the epiglottis. Then disluxation of the epiglottis and detachment of the mucosa of the lingual surface of the epiglottis and detachment of the larynx, initially on the right side. Then inspection of the tumor and removal of the tumor in the pharyngeal part in the piriform sinus on the left with a safety margin of 1.5 cm and removal of the larynx below the cricoid cartilage. Removal of marginal samples from the mucosa. All marginal samples are tumor-free, free of carcinoma in situ and without high-grade dysplasia. Now inspection of the mucosa, intraoperative demonstration on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. A joint decision is made to dispense with a transplant as there is still sufficient local mucosa. Now complete the neck dissection on both sides, on the right side through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. For this, expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Then free preparation of the internal jugular vein and the facial vein, then removal of the neck preparation IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Several small roundish metastases were found in level II, the levels were sent in individually as part of the lymph node study and the neck dissection was carried out on the left side at the same time. This revealed a very large lymph node conglomerate that completely infiltrated the internal jugular vein, which was therefore removed. The vagus nerve was also found to be infiltrated. In consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, this is also resected; the metastasis can then be detached from the common carotid artery and the external and internal carotid arteries. The accessorius nerve can be preserved, but the more distal plexus branches are interspersed with metastases and infiltrated, so most of these must be resected, resulting in a radical neck dissection on the left side and a modified radical neck dissection on the right side. A Provox-Vega prosthesis is then placed in the usual manner, followed by a three-layer pharyngeal suture in the usual manner. Incision of the tracheostoma in the usual manner and two-layer wound closure after insertion of 2 Redon drains.","Laryngectomy, Partial pharyngectomy, and Neck dissection

Therefore, carrying out the team time out. Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Then insertion of the PEG gastric tube. Careful insertion of the flexible endoscope under air insufflation. Then positive diaphanoscopy loco typico. Subsequent skin disinfection of the abdomen and upper abdomen, infiltration anesthesia and placement of the PEG gastric tube using the thread pull-through technique without any problems by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Preoperative administration of 3 g Unacid. The tumor is then resected by <CLINICIAN_NAME> . Adjustment of the base of the tongue by <CLINICIAN_NAME> with the spreading laryngoscope and the support. Use the microscope. The tumor of at least 1 cm in size described in the panendoscopy is seen in the cranial base of the tongue, not approaching the midline, but there is still questionable unstable mucosa at the caudal medial edge. Now set the laser to cw 8 watts. Mark the resection margins with the laser. Successive resection of the tumor using the laser with the aid of Blakesley. Attention is paid to the lateral vascular bundle. Laser resection is performed up to the borders of the oropharynx laterally and into the vallecula. The mass is then sent to the frozen section in toto with the markings cranial tongue base and lateral oropharyngeal side wall, caudal vallecula and medial. Repeated meticulous hemostasis, then dry wound conditions. The frozen section then shows a CIS forming a margin from 3 o'clock to 12 o'clock. Therefore, the resection is now performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. To do this, adjust the base of the tongue with the spreading laryngoscope and, with the aid of the support, adjust using a microscope and laser. The laser is set to 8 watts. Now successive resection. Final marginal samples are taken from 3 o'clock/ oropharyngeal side wall to 6 o'clock. A second margin sample from 6 o'clock to 9 o'clock, suture marking at 6 o'clock and third margin sample from 9 o'clock to 12 o'clock. The post-resection shows that the mucosa is completely normal; it is not possible to differentiate between CIS and normal mucosa. Then repeated hemostasis using monopolar coagulation, followed by re-inspection of the surgical site with the Kleinsasser tube. Occasionally targeted bipolar coagulation. There is now a large wound surface over the entire base of the tongue from the right to the opposite side and filling the entire vallecula. Here, however, the wound is dry. Subsequent transition to neck dissection on the right side. Infiltration anesthesia with a total of 20 ml Ultracaine in the area of the neck dissection incision on the right side and on the left side. Skin disinfection of the surgical area and sterile draping of the surgical area. Then mark the landmarks on both sides of the mastoid, jugulum, mandibular angle and mandibular margin and sternocleidomastoid anterior margin. Then mark the skin incisions on the right and left of the mastoid in an arched medial direction and towards the sternocleidomastoid in a caudal direction. Ensure that the incision is as symmetrical as possible on both sides. Now start on the right side. Cut through the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue, cut through the platysma. Now develop the medial neck preparation and dissect subplatysmal using a scalpel. Expose the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid and dissect it caudally. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and sparing of the same. Exposure of the entire course of the jugular vein and protection of the same. This is conspicuously thin, with a jump in caliber only in the caudal part of level IV. Exposure of the cervical vein, which is also exposed and spared. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the digaster venter anteriorly and posteriorly and protection of the same. Exposure of the mandibular salivary gland. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and sparing of the same. Now resection of the medial neck preparation. Here 2 suspicious level II lymph nodes are noticed. These are resected in toto. Expose the internal and external bifurcation and the superior thyroid artery and spare them. Note: The auricularis magnus nerve was exposed and spared during the skin incision. A larger caliber branch of the external jugular vein was ligated. Now resection of the lateral triangle of the neck. Here, the vagus nerve is first exposed and spared, the accessorius triangle is resected cranial to the accessorius nerve, mobilization under the accessorius nerve. Dissection down to the plexus branches and resection of the lateral neck preparation from cranial to caudal up to level IV as well as level Va and b. The plexus branches are also spared. Removal of the lateral neck preparation. The facial vein could not be visualized. Now targeted bipolar coagulation, irrigation with H202 and Ringer. Increase in pressure to 160, targeted bipolar coagulation, otherwise very dry wound conditions. Application of a 10 redon and two-layer wound closure using subcutaneous and cutaneous sutures. Application of a pressure dressing. Turning to the opposite side. Identical procedure here. First cut through the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma with a scalpel. Expose the auricularis magnus nerve. Sparing of the same. Dissection of the branches of the external jugular vein and ligation of the same. The neck preparation is dissected subplatysmally. Expose the anterior sternocleidomastoid margin and dissect caudally. Exposure of the jugular vein and sparing of the same. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and sparing of the same. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Cranial dissection. Exposure of the digaster venter anteriorly and posteriorly as well as the mandibular salivary gland. Now resection of the medial neck preparation, exposing the cervical anus and the hypoglossal nerve, which is spared. Removal of the medial neck specimen. Resection of the lateral neck specimen. The carotid artery and the vagus are still exposed and spared. Level IIa, Va and III are also resected up to level IV. The plexus branches are exposed and spared. Then targeted bipolar coagulation, irrigation with H202 and Ringer. Increase the peep and pressure, then no further bleeding. Dry wound conditions. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon and two-layer wound closure using subcutaneous and cutaneous sutures. Application of a pressure dressing. Now create a protective tracheostomy. To do this, mark the thyroid incisura, cricoid cartilage, jugulum and the planned skin incision 1 QF below the cricoid cartilage. Now make the skin incision of approx. 3 cm horizontally and cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose a larger caliber vein, which is ligated. Dissection of the infrahyal musculature. Incision in the median line. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the isthmus, this is relatively far cranial. Undermining of the isthmus using a clamp. Overall, the isthmus is very narrow, therefore coagulation in the median line and transection of the isthmus. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea and the tracheal clips. The brachiocephalic trunk can be palpated in depth. Now identify the area between the 2nd and 3rd cricoid cartilage. Enter with the scissors. Suture with 2 caudal and 2 cranial sutures. Skin suture with 2 stitches on the right and left. Then problem-free reintubation to an 8-gauge cannula and completion of the procedure without complications.

This goes approximately to the middle of the dissection seen from the caudal side, as the tumor is already infiltrating the musculature here. Now expose the lower border in the sense of the omohyoid muscle. Visualization of the jugular vein. It can be seen that it runs through the tumor block, with an extremely congested facial vein. Now laboriously locate the digaster muscle and successively release the tumor block in the upper accessorius triangle. The accessorius nerve can be exposed with great effort, as it runs through the tumor. However, it can be separated from the tumor while preserving a small displacement layer. Demonstration of the findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and decision to leave the nerve in place. Now, with resection of parts of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, detachment of the tumor specimen laterally. Subsequent medial dissection. The tumor extends to the carotid artery with a clear displacement layer. As the jugular vein runs through the tumor, clamp it caudally and cranially, place 2 lower ligatures as well as 2 re-stitches and remove the vein. The tumor block can now be easily worked out after detachment from the vagus nerve. In between, a swab of tumor secretions is taken and sent for microbiological examination. Further excision of the tumor block with partial removal of plexus branches. The hypoglossal nerve has already been exposed due to dissection. The decision was made to ligate the external carotid artery. Identification of the same, visualization of the thyroid artery and the ascending lingual pharyngeal artery. The external carotid artery is then ligated. Then dissect up to the capsule of the submandibular gland and remove it. Follicularization of the anterior neck and irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Minute bipolar hemostasis and insertion of a Redon drain. Then two-layer wound closure.

The patient did not undergo adjuvant radiochemotherapy. The follow-up examination revealed a contrast-enhancing mass at the base of the tongue on the left side. A bipsie was taken by panendoscopy and a p16-negative squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed. There is now an indication for transoral tumor resection. The patient was informed in detail preoperatively and had sufficient time to ask questions.","Transfer of the patient to the operating room. Carrying out the team time-out after active patient identification and initial consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. Induction of intubation anesthesia, bronchoscopically by the colleagues. Head positioning by the surgeon. Insertion of the spandex lip retractor and the covered retractor to open the mouth. Inspection of the oropharynx. In the previously described location in the area of the glossotonsillar groove on the left side, a tumor-suspicious ulcer can be seen with slight irregularity of the mucosa. The ulcer extends to the lateral wall of the oropharynx just below the upper pole of the tonsil. Extension of the ulcer of 0.5 x 0.5 cm. In addition, the lateral oropharyngeal wall is palpable. In addition, a palpable mass below the ulcer extending into the base of the tongue. It is decided to incise the area extensively with a safety margin of one cm. To do this, first make an incision in the area of the base of the tongue and carefully dissect with the ultracision knife. The preparation is made in healthy muscles. Dissection is carried out under constant coagulation of small blood vessels and palpatory control. Now also dissection laterally down to the lower jaw. Healthy tissue can be left on the lower jaw so that no bone is exposed. During dissection, the lingual nerve is exposed, which is looped and moved laterally. Now also detach the tumor from the cranial tonsil pole. Here, entry in the area of the anterior palatal arch and dissection of the tonsillar lobe. Incision of the posterior palatal arch and careful pushing of the resectate from the lateral oropharyngeal side wall. This exposes the parapharyngeal vessels, which are safely spared and dissected away from the tumor. A branch of the lingual artery is clipped. After removal of the tumor in the area of the base of the tongue, the lingual artery is exposed over a distance of approx. one cm. The resectate is then placed on the cork plate, marked with a needle and sent for a frozen section histological examination. After feedback from the pathology colleagues, the status is R0 with free resection margins. Bipolar hemostasis of several smaller bleedings in the area of the base of the tongue and the lateral oropharyngeal side wall is performed. The lateral oropharyngeal side wall is sutured over for vascular protection. In addition, wound adaptation of the edges of the tongue and base of tongue to cover the lingual artery. Due to the risk of bleeding, in consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, it was decided to create a protective tracheostoma. After tumor resection as described above, a protective tracheostoma is created. Repositioning and covering the patient. Marking of the thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage and jugulum. Easy palpation of the most important structures is possible. Now make a skin incision approx. 2 1/2 cm long and approx. 1 QF wide below the cricoid cartilage. Further dissection in depth with bipolar coagulation of the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Strict dissection along the median line through the prelaryngeal musculature. Intermittent bipolar coagulation of smaller vessels, now exposing the thyroid level. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus from cranial to caudal using a curved clamp, followed by extensive bipolar coagulation of the isthmus and transection using scissors. Blunt dissection and exposure of the trachea. Locate the area between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp. Bipolar marking here for later incision. Now carefully open the trachea using pointed scissors, taking great care not to damage the cuff. Now create the anastomosis between the skin and trachea in the conventional manner. For this purpose, back-stitch suture using Vicryl 4.0 at two points caudally and cranially, laterally in each case. This is successful without any problems, resulting in an epithelialized tracheostoma. Withdrawal of the tube through the anesthesia and problem-free insertion of a size 8 tracheostomy tube. Subsequent intubation without complications and application of a wound dressing. The operation was completed under dry wound conditions. Summary: R0 resection of a cT1 cN0 oropharyngeal carcinoma in the area of the glossotonsillar groove on the left side. The resection margins are all tumor-free in the frozen section. Please present the case at our interdisciplinary tumor conference. Nutrition for 6 days via nasogastric tube.","Transoral tumor resection, Tracheotomy, Protective tracheostomy

This works well despite the pronounced ankylosing spondylitis. Inspection of the glottis reveals the tumor located in the anterior region of the left vocal fold. This does not quite reach backwards to the vocal process. Ventrally, it already reaches the anterior commissure, but is still easily accessible transorally. Laser resection then begins with the CO2 laser at 4 watts in continuous wave mode. First, the tumor is cut approximately in the middle from medial to lateral and the dorsal part of the tumor is successively resected. This involves parts of the vocalis muscle, although the tumor does not appear to have grown particularly far into the tissue at this point. Resection extends posteriorly to the vocalis process. After removal of the dorsal part of the tumor, marginal samples are taken from the marginal areas, which are found to be free of tumor and dysplasia by frozen section pathology. Transition to resection of the anterior part of the tumor. For the sake of clarity, a narrow strip of mucosa is first resected in the supraglottis area, which extends to above the anterior commissure. This means that the lateral part of the tumor is also easily visible. Mobilizing the tumour medially, the lateral and deep parts are resected first. The anterior commissure is then included in the resection as well as the first 2 - 3 mm of the right vocal fold. The resection is performed down to the thyroid cartilage, where the tumor in the area of the anterior commissure is released and removed together with the perichondrium. The tumor is then removed from the anterior commissure, partly with a laser and partly bluntly. Finally, it can then be removed in toto with resection of the medial parts. Suture marking in the area of the anterior commissure. Here too, representative marginal samples are taken in turn and from the base of the tumor, which also prove to be free of tumor and dysplasia by frozen section pathology. Subsequently, careful hemostasis by monopolar coagulation and compression with adrenaline-containing cotton swabs until the blood is completely dry. Remove the instruments without damaging the teeth. Transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Completion of the operation. Transoral laser surgical laser resection of a T1 glottic laryngeal carcinoma on the left side in the sense of a chordectomy and inclusion of the anterior commissure. The resection margins were tumor-free on frozen section histology.

Sonographic evidence of a lateral cervical cyst. The palpable mass is well displaceable in levels II to III. Overall obese patient with a short neck, extremely unfavorable anatomical conditions. Skin incision along a skin fold, approx. 2 transverse fingers submandibular. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Ample subcutaneous fatty tissue. Partial resection of the fatty tissue. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Here one encounters a cystic mass which appears to lie lateral to the internal jugular vein. Overall cystic mass, but some patchy changes in the mass. Overall neck cyst possible, but not an absolutely typical finding. Successive triggering of the cystic mass. Involvement of surrounding lymphatic tissue. The mass is located directly on the jugular vein and laterally. Circumscribed treatment and exposure of the superior artery. Extirpation of the cystic mass in toto. Careful wound inspection and, if the wound is dry, irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Subsequent careful, two-layer wound closure after insertion of an 8-gauge Redon drain. Repositioning for tonsillectomy on the right. Entry with the tonsil retractor. Inspection of the tonsillar lobes. These are symmetrical with cryptic and rather small tonsils. Entering the anterior upper palatal arch. Exposure of the tonsil capsule. Removal of the macroscopically inconspicuous tonsil using the dissection technique. Protection of the parauvular mucosal triangle. Detachment from the posterior palatal arch with careful protection of the musculature and placement at the lower tonsil pole. Targeted treatment of the upper and lower tonsil pole.

First positioning of the patient for transoral tumor resection. Insertion of the mouth retractor. Subsequent marking of the margins. The tumor extends from the middle of the tongue body at the edge of the tongue to the base of the tongue and passes over to the glossotonsillar groove. Here it still partially infiltrates the anterior gauemnian arch. Medially, the tumor extends to approximately the middle of the tongue. Therefore, the first step is to approach the tumor and resect it with the Harmonic ultrasonic knife. The resection is performed under constant visual control and at a sufficient distance from the tumor. Larger vessels are ligated during resection. Follow the tumor dorsally. Detachment of the tumor at the palatal arch. Here resection of the glossotonsillar groove on the right side. Further tracing of the tumor at the medial edge of the deposit in a dorsal direction. This shows a cone that extends beyond the midline. This cone is also cut around and the tumor is removed in toto together with the base of the tongue on the right side. At a point where the tumor has formed the cone medially, the specimen is marked with a suture and sent for frozen section diagnostics. The tumor is barely resected in sano, which is why an additional safety margin is resected from the medial tongue body. Two representative frozen section samples are taken in the area of the margin of the floor of the mouth and palatal arch to ensure R0 resection. These are also sent for intraoperative frozen section diagnostics and are found to be tumor-free. Subtle hemostasis. Repositioning of the patient for PEG insertion. First, insertion of the flexible instrument into the esophagus and visualization up to the stomach. After filling the stomach with air, a positive diaphanoscopy is obtained. Then place the gastric tube in the typical location under visual control, with positive diaphanoscopy and positive tent phenomenon using the thread pull-through method. After aspiration of the insufflated air, mirror back and carefully inspect the esophageal mucosa, which is also non-irritant and inconspicuous. Removal of the instruments. The patient is repositioned for tracheotomy. This is necessary due to the extent of the tumor. Tracheotomy: First injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline on both sides of the neck in preparation for neck dissection and pretracheally. Inverted T-incision and layered preparation in depth. Finding the midline. Dissection of the musculature, which is dissected away to the side. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Exposing the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus on both sides, .................................... is ligated. Separation of the isthmus in the midline and exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp and preparation of a Björk flap. Subsequent circular suturing of the trachea in the sense of an epithelialized tracheotomy. The patient was then intubated and a size 7 tracheostomy tube was inserted. The patient was repositioned for neck dissection, initially on the right side. Incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth in layers after cutting through the platysma. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the digaster muscle. This reveals a large conglomerate of lymph nodes in the area of the venous angle. Numerous other lymph nodes can be found in the lateral neck preparation. First expose the cervical vascular sheath. Long-distance dissection of the vagus nerve, which is lifted out of its bed in the sense of a neurolysis and moved medially in a long distance. Re-embedding of the nerve here. Subsequent exposure of the accessory nerve and dissection of the lateral neck preparation of levels II, III, IV and V. Dissection of the anterior neck preparation with preservation of the branches of the internal jugular vein and the external carotid artery. Clearing of the hypoglossal triangle. Long dissection of the nerve and neurolysis. Re-embedding of the nerve after cranial displacement. Exposure of the submandibular capsule. This is subtotally removed. Subsequent exposure of the gland. Preservation of the facial artery and vein after they are first dissected away from the gland. The supplying vessels are cut off. The gland is then detached from the glandular bed. Circular dissection of the gland and exposure of the uncinate process and the excretory duct. Ligation of the excretory duct and subsequent removal of the gland. A tiny defect is revealed in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth, which is generously sutured over with floor of mouth muscles. Taping of the suture with TachoSil. Overall, the neck dissection of the right side revealed numerous suspicious nodules in the five levels. Irrigation of the wound and repeated palpation, whereupon no more enlarged lymph nodes were palpated. Insertion of a Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure bandage. Transition to the left side: Here, an arc-shaped skin incision is made along a neck fold. Here too, layer-by-layer dissection in depth after cutting through the platysma. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and long dissection of the vagus nerve. Neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the nerve. Clearing of the hypoglossal triangle after a small lymph node conglomerate is also revealed here. Long-term exposure Dissection of the hpyoglossal nerve, which is also re-embedded after neurolysis and cranial displacement. The accessorius nerve is also exposed. This is also dissected over a long distance and relocated after neurolysis. Re-embedding of the accessory nerve. Dissection of levels II and III, which are completely dissected. Subtle hemostasis. Irrigation of the wound. Insertion of a Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure bandage. Repositioning of the patient and enoral wound control. Subtle hemostasis again. The defect cannot be identified here. To prevent a fistula here, TachoSil is still applied to the posterior floor of the mouth. The TachoSil is fixed in place with a ball swab that is sewn on. If the wound is dry, the procedure is completed. Final consultation with the anesthetist.","Resection, Selective bilateral neck dissection, and Tracheotomy

In addition, there is a suspicion of an ear canal cholesteatoma on the right. The above-mentioned procedure should therefore be performed.","First of all, a consultation with the anesthetist. And after induction of anesthesia, tracheoscopy and inspection of the endolarynx up to the bifurcation. Inconspicuous conditions here. No indication of mucosal irregularities. After intubation, perform hypopharyngoscopy, microlaryngoscopy and pharyngoscopy. In each case, the findings were unremarkable except for the prescribed lesion approx. 1 cm in size in the area of the hard palate, which then had extensions of reddish altered mucosa to the soft palate. After another flexible gastroesophagoscopy has been performed, which reveals an inflamed mucosa in the stomach, the local erosion is then successively dissected out with the CO2 laser and the handpiece with 10 watts of power in the case of suspected neoplasia in the sense of an excision biopsy. This works well. Suture marking with a short-short suture marker for the front and a long-long suture marker for the side. The preparation is sent for final histology. Now, after careful hemostasis, repositioning for ear surgery on the right side. After sterile draping, an auxiliary incision and counter-incision are made. Overall very heavy bleeding in the patient, who is under heparinization and has low thrombocytes of 80,000. This bleeding made the operation considerably more difficult. Due to a history of coronary heart disease, it is unfortunately not possible to inject xylocaine or lidocaine with added adrenaline. After further careful hemostasis, a Stacke II flap is developed and the cholesteatoma originating in the anterior wall is exposed in the auditory canal. This is cut around in a circular fashion. The skin of the auditory canal is then dissected to form an anterior tympanomeatal flap and the cholesteatoma sac is completely released. This is also successful. At the same time, a bony stenosis of the ear canal is revealed, so that this is partially drilled away with the diamond drill very carefully and with great difficulty in order to protect the anterior tympanomeatal flap, which continues to bleed. This also works well. Better view towards the tympanic membrane. Tragus cartilage is now removed. Careful hemostasis here too. The tragus cartilage is then inserted as a cartilage perichondrium plate to reconstruct the anterior wall of the auditory canal. In addition, perichondrium is placed over it to equalize the level of the remaining ear canal skin. Filling of the ear canal with vibravenous gel. Suture of the auxiliary incision. Ointment strip tamponade and, after consultation with the anesthesiologist, completion of the procedure.","Excisional biopsy with laser

In the absence of pre-existing histology, there is an indication for panendoscopy and frozen section and then, if necessary, further procedures. The patient had enough time to ask questions before the operation.","Transfer of the patient to the operating theater and positioning of the patient. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department and performance of the team time-out. Problem-free intubation with Cormack I and inconspicuous tracheoscopy. Now start slinging the tongue and PE from the mass on the right edge of the tongue. This is approx. 3 x 2 ˝ cm in size and extends from the middle third of the tongue to the posterior third of the tongue, the base of the tongue itself is free, as well as in the anterior area of the mass down to the floor of the mouth. The right Wharton's duct is congested, the tongue is still mobile, no midline crossing or infiltration of the tonsillar lobe can be seen. Now esophagogastroscopy. Here the stomach is unremarkable and non-irritable, with no evidence of bleeding or a mass. Any fluid present is aspirated and the stomach is pumped out. The oesophagus is unremarkable. Now enter with the small bore tube C and inspect the rest of the oral cavity and palpate the tonsils and base of the tongue. These are unremarkable, the vallecula is clear and the epiglottis is also unremarkable. With good adjustability, the piriform sinuses are pre-mirrored and expanded. These are inconspicuous on both sides and without irritation, the posterior and lateral pharyngeal walls and the postcricoid region are also inconspicuous, the vocal folds can be adjusted well on both sides up to the anterior commissure and are also inconspicuous here. In the case of invasive squamous cell carcinoma in the frozen section, the tongue is now snared and the resection borders are marked with the ultrasonic knife. First, both papillae are dilated with the dilator and saliva is massaged out. This is possible on both sides, and it is also possible to insert a myrtle leaf probe on both sides, assuming that the duct is intact on both sides. After insertion of the myrtle leaf probe, the tumor is successively cut around with the ultrasonic knife, with palpation and inspection of the tumor extension. The tumor is successively and further removed. Identification of the lingual nerve and protection of this. However, smaller divisions of the nerve must be resected as they run directly into the tumor. Easy removal and suture marking of the tumor. Sending for frozen section. The mass at the left nasal entrance is also biopsied and sent for frozen section. This also shows a nasal entrance carcinoma, which is why resection, suture marking and removal of marginal samples are also performed here. In the small defect of the cartilage on the left side, a small full-thickness skin graft is taken from the right neck and, after notification of the frozen section (R0), this is sutured onto the left nasal entrance as a patch. The result is very good. Now feedback from the frozen section. In the case of R1 resection, the anterior floor of the mouth is resected again. These resections or margin samples are now tumor-free (R0). For this reason, the tongue is primarily closed with Vicryl 3-0. Again, care is taken to ensure that the duct is not damaged, saliva can be expressed without any problems and the duct can still be easily probed. Insertion of a nasogastric tube and completion of the operation. Conclusion: Simultaneous cT2 tongue margin carcinoma and cT1 nasal entrance carcinoma on the left side with suspected cN1 cM0. The nasogastric tube should be left in place for at least 3 days. After receiving the final histology, the patient should be presented to the interdisciplinary tumor conference. The necessity of a unilateral or bilateral neck dissection should also be discussed here. Regular gland massage and administration of Sialagoga should also be carried out. The antibiotic treatment started intraoperatively with 3 g Unacid should be continued for 1 week. The patient received a single shot of SDHS 250 mg i.v. intraoperatively. The stitches on the nose should be removed after 7 days, the stitches on the neck after 10 days.","Panendoscopy, Tumor resection of the left tongue margin

Laryngoscopy performed using a Kleinsasser C-tube. Inconspicuous conditions there. Inspection of the supraglottis revealed an exophytic mass covered by rough mucosa, which subtotally occupied the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis and completely invaded the pharyngoepiglottic fold laterally. Clamping of the spreading laryngoscope and adjustment of the findings. Setting the CO2 laser to a power of 6 W in continuous mode and successive traversing of the findings, which were removed using the piecemeal technique. Subsequently, three marginal samples were taken (central tongue base, right lateral pharyngeal side wall, right posterior pharyngeal side wall). In the third marginal sample ( pharyngeal lateral wall right posterior ), focal CIS parts were detected by the pathology colleagues. Thus, generous resection in this region and removal of a second marginal sample at the same site. Both the resected specimen and the second marginal specimen were sent for final histology. Hemostasis there by means of bipolar coagulation. An arterial vessel was treated three times with a clip. Repeated inspection. Dry conditions. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient was to be fed exclusively via PEG for the next 7 days.","Laser resection, MLE (Microlaryngoscopy and Endoscopy)

Entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the tumor. A flat, exophytic mass is seen on the right side, which starts on the pharyngeal side wall approx. 1 cm below the tonsil lobe on the right side and grows caudally. The mass ends at the entrance of the piriform sinus. The tip of the piriform sinus is free. The tumor infiltrates the mucosa at the arytenoid cartilage. However, the arytenoid cartilage itself is still mobile and does not appear to be deeply infiltrated. Infiltration of the thyroid cartilage cannot be ruled out. Intraoperative demonstration of the findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. It is decided to open the pharynx from the outside and perform the tumor resection from the cervical right side. First perform the neck dissection on the right side. To do this, expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein and clearing of neck levels II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches and the accessorius and hypoglossal nerves. Now dissect the thyroid gland from the hypopharyngeal and laryngeal area and enter the pharynx through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The tumor can be easily visualized and is successively incised. The tumor itself can be retrieved en bloc. It is clear from the tumor resection that there is limited thyroid cartilage infiltration. In this case, thyroid cartilage is also resected and sent to histology attached to the tumor specimen. Now take edge samples. All mucosal margins are removed, including in the area of the arytenoid cartilage and soft tissue. All marginal samples are classified as R0 in the frozen section. The defect is so large that it cannot be closed primarily. A platysma flap was originally planned to cover the defect; this was also prepared in the caudal region and on the posterior surface as part of the skin incision. Ultimately, it became apparent that the patient's upper skin was extremely thin and there was virtually no subcutaneous layer, which meant that the platysma flap was not possible to cover the defect, as it could not be guaranteed that the remaining skin would remain vital. It was therefore decided to cover the defect with an anterolateral thigh graft. Turning to the leg. First Doppler the perforator vessels. 1 main perforator and 2 secondary perforators can be detected. The graft is drawn in so that the main perforator is positioned exactly in the center of the graft. Now incise along the anterior edge down to the rectus femoris muscle. Then dissect laterally into the sulcus between the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis muscles. The descending ramus can be localized here and followed cranially to the profunda femoris artery. From the descending ramus, the main perforator is localized using the Doppler and carefully dissected towards the graft so that it is completely preserved. The graft can now be cut around completely and the pedicle vessel can be placed at the bottom. A very good graft perforation can be seen over the main perforator the whole time. The 2 secondary perforators do not extend directly into the skin, but rather deep into the muscle, which is why they cannot be integrated into the graft. At the end, dissection of the pedicle and removal of the pedicle far proximally. Primary wound closure in several layers in the area of the remaining leg wound. The graft is sutured into place. Suturing must be carried out using pre-positioned sutures and is somewhat difficult, especially in the area of the base of the tongue. Finally, the anastomosis is performed. The arterial vessel is sutured to the superior thyroid artery, which must be very well prepared for this, as it is much smaller in caliber than the flap vessel. Nevertheless, an anastomosis can be created. The vein is connected to an outlet from the internal jugular vein using a coupler. Then graft control. There is good blood flow. Insertion of a Redon drain on the left side and a flap on the right side. Even before the neck is completely sutured shut, venous congestion is seen in the flap vessel, so the inserted coupler has to be opened again and it becomes apparent that the coupler was directly in front of a venous valve. The vein in the flap pedicle is therefore prepared and shortened again and recoupled to another vein. Now permanent, good return flow, therefore two-layer wound closure on the neck and insertion of a tracheal cannula after a tracheotomy was performed in the usual manner. Please check the flap according to the usual procedure. Continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Feeding via the PEG tube. The inserted nasogastric tube should be left in place as a splint for 10 days. If there is any indication of a fistula, please open the neck.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Pedicled flap (ALT)

Carcinoma is located in the piriform sinus anterior wall area, extending to the lateral wall and to the lateral part of the aryepiglottic fold. The arytenoid cartilage itself is macroscopically free, vocal fold mobility is not impaired. Corresponding extension on CT. No thyroid cartilage infiltration or infiltration of the rest of the laryngeal skeleton.","First laryngoscopy and pharyngoscopy: The exophytic process is seen at the location described. Indication for surgery given. Lateral infiltration into the wall too deep for laser resection. Position the patient, disinfect the skin, inject a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline in the area of the apron flap on both sides and cover all surgical areas with sterile drapes. First creation of an apron flap subplatysmal and dissection up to the submandibular gland and hyoid bone. Then neck dissection on the right: Dissection of the fat lymph node package from the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal and external carotid artery as well as the internal jugular vein, facial vein and external jugular vein. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery, the superior laryngeal nerve, the vagus nerve, the accessorius nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. Then develop the neck preparation, initially dorsally, exposing and preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Then develop the anterior neck preparation. This results in evacuation of levels II to V. Neck dissection on the left side: This is performed in the same way as on the right side. All structures are exposed and preserved. This results in evacuation of levels II to IV. Then tracheotomy: splitting of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, which is passed underneath, clamped, severed and supplied with puncture ligatures. A tracheotomy is created between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage using a wide pedicled Björk flap. This is epithelialized caudally. Subsequently reintubation and insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. Tumor resection via lateral pharyngotomy on the right: exposure and isolation of the hyoid bone and superior cornu of the laryngeal skeleton. Entry into the pharynx at the level of the hyoid bone. Exposure of the tumor. Incision of the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1.5 to 2 cm on all sides of the macroscopically visible tumor. Removal of the hypopharyngeal side wall/front wall. Lateral thyroid cartilage is also removed as it is located in front of the deepest tumor infiltration. The edge of the epiglottis with vallecula and aryepiglottic fold on the right is also removed up to the arytenoid cartilage, from which the mucosa is removed, but which ultimately does not need to be removed itself. Resection includes posterior lateral areas of the postcricoid region. On the specimen, the tumor is clearly removed macroscopically in healthy tissue. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section. Carcinoma in situ infiltrates are still visible in the lateral epiglottis margin and arytenoid region. Therefore, a resection is performed in the area of the arytenoid fold, the entrance to the piriform sinus up to the epiglottis and samples are taken from the margins. These are now tumor-free. So finally R0 resection. Defect size now indication for radial flap. Size of the flap approx. 9 x 6 cm. This is drawn on the left forearm. Drawing of a skin monitor. Lift the flap first from the ulnar and then from the radial side. Take the skin monitor and the superficial venous system with you. Locate the vascular pedicle under the brachioradialis muscle. Visualization and tracing into the crook of the elbow. After clamping the radial artery caudally, it is removed after an appropriate time with constant saturation around 100% and ligated proximally and distally using 4-0 Prolene puncture ligatures. Successive dissection of the flap with the pedicle in the direction of the antecubital fossa. Outgoing vessels are bipolarly coagulated or treated with clips. Exposure of the radial artery with entry into the brachial artery in the antecubital fossa. Also visualization of the interosseous artery. Exposure of the deep venous system with connection to the superficial venous system. Cephalic vein shows 2 larger outlets. Finally, removal of the flap. The veins are ligated. The radial artery is placed in front of the entrance to the interosseous space, preserving it, and closed using 6-0 Vascufil sutures. The cutaneous nerve to the skin island is carefully preserved and integrated into the flap to its maximum length. The flap is then irrigated with heparin solution. The flap is successively incorporated into the defect using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Tension-free and complete closure. The cutaneous nerve is then dissected to just in front of the skin monitor and knocked down towards the end of the superior laryngeal nerve. Conditioning of the nerve endings. Nerve suture with 9-0 Ethilon single button sutures. Subsequent conditioning of the flap vessels with connection on the right side. The radial artery is anastomosed with the superior thyroid artery using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. Both ends of the cephalic vein are conditioned. The larger outlet is anastomosed with an outlet from the facial vein. The other, smaller end of the cephalic vein is then anastomosed with a smaller outlet from the internal jugular vein, also using a 2.5 mm coupler. Good venous return in each case. Positive smear phenomenon. The thyroid gland is then stitched over the distal end of the flap and sutured to the remaining infrahyoid muscles. This protects the distal flap tip against fistula formation. Careful irrigation of the entire wound area, careful hemostasis. Knock back the apron flap. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain on both sides. Complete epithelialization of the tracheostoma. The defect on the forearm is primarily closed cranially. To close the remaining caudal skin defect of approx. 9 x 6 cm, a 0.8 mm thick split-thickness skin graft is harvested from the right thigh using the dermatome. The skin is successively incorporated into the forearm defect. The thigh is covered with a vein dressing. The forearm is covered with a hydrogel-Mepilex dressing. Apply a cotton swab dressing on top. Wrap with absorbent cotton. Application of a Kramer splint, which is adjusted and wrapped with an elastic bandage in a functional position. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue heparin perfusor, which was started intraoperatively at 500 units per hour, for 5 days. Control of the flap via skin monitor and Doppler probe for 5 days according to the schedule. Patient should be fed via PEG tube for approx. 10 days, then gradually build up diet. As the defect in the right postcricoid region and the piriform sinus was relatively extensive due to the necessary resection and removal of marginal samples, a protracted postoperative swallowing disorder is certainly to be expected. Therefore, plan swallowing rehabilitation at an early stage. Therefore also sensitization of the radial lobe. Overall cT2-3 cN2b hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Postoperative radiochemotherapy should certainly be discussed.","Partial larynx-pharynx resection, Pharyngoscopy, Laryngoscopy

An exophytic tumor mass was found in the area of the right piriform sinus, filling the entire piriform sinus and growing submucosally in a cranial direction. The aryepiglottic fold and the arytenoid cartilage on the right side are reached. The endolaryngeal pocket folds and vocal folds are tumor-free. The epiglottis is also tumor-free. However, the pharyngoepiglottic fold is also covered by the tumor. Esophageal entrance just clear. Then enter with the flexible esophagoscope and view into the stomach. No abnormalities here. PEG placement using the thread pull-through method with good diaphanoscopy - this was successful without any problems. Injection of Ultracaine in the neck area and sterile washing and draping. Then creation of an apron flap and start of neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digaster muscle. Then exposure of the nervus accessorius, the facial vein and the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the plexus branches and removal of the neck preparation II a to V a, sparing the plexus branches. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery and the external jugular vein. Then release of the cervical vascular sheath from the larynx. Separation of the superior laryngeal nerve, the artery and the superior laryngeal vein. Detachment of the thyroid gland from the larynx and change to the opposite side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. Then visualization of the facial vein and the internal jugular vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Then release of the medial neck block and visualization of the accessorius nerve and the plexus branches. Release the neck preparation II a to V a, sparing the plexus branches through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Perform the tracheotomy. To do this, enter the trachea, after severing the thyroid isthmus, between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage and create a mucocutaneous anastomosis in the caudal region. Re-intubation and pharyngotomy on the left side. Disluxation of the epiglottis and incision of the mucosa along the edge of the epiglottis. The tumor can be seen as described above. The tumor is resected with a safety margin of at least 1 cm to 1.5 cm in the pharyngeal region. Unfortunately, nothing of the larynx can be preserved, firstly because the arytenoid cartilage is infiltrated on the right side and secondly because the thyroid cartilage is extensively infiltrated on the right side and cannot be detached from the pharynx and the tumor at all. On the left side this was achieved without any problems. Now successive excision of the tumor, taking the laryngeal preparation with it. Removal of the larynx below the cricoid cartilage. It then becomes clear that the resection in the area of the esophageal entrance was very close, a large resection is taken here and then a final marginal specimen is taken again. At the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, the tumor is growing towards the soft tissue; here, too, the resection was very close. However, there is still a very thin, muscular displacement layer above the tumor. To be on the safe side, the infrahyoid musculature, which is located directly at this site, is resected again extensively and thickly and sent for final histology with a thread marker. The specimen is thread-marked and sent to the frozen section. In the frozen section, overall R0 situation, including the final edge sample at the esophageal entrance, this was discussed by telephone with the pathologists, a resection was not necessary at any point. A myotomy of the upper esophageal sphincter was performed. Now lifting of the radialis graft, 13 x 7 cm. Unfortunately, primary closure cannot be performed in the pharyngeal region as too little mucosa remains. The radialis graft is lifted in the usual way. First cut around the skin. Incision of the skin along the forearm up to the crook of the elbow. Then expose the venous star with the superficial venous system and locate the venous confluence with the deep venous system. Visualization of the brachioradialis muscle. Visualization of the radial superficial ramus nerve. Exposure of the radial artery. Clamping of the radial artery under pulse oximetric control - here always 100% saturation on the hand. Dissection of the radial artery and detachment of the graft from the tendons. Then dissect the pedicle in the usual way and place the radial artery graft in the crook of the elbow. Two different veins are lifted, one from the deep and one from the superficial system with preserved confluence. The graft is then sutured into the pharynx, which is of course somewhat difficult in the area of the base of the tongue and also in the area of the esophageal entrance. A pointed Z-plasty is performed here to counteract any subsequent esophageal inlet stenosis. Sutures are placed in the esophageal entrance for this purpose. Finally, the transplant is inserted with a precise fit. Repositioning to perform the anastomosis. The arterial anastomosis is performed via the superior thyroid, the venous anastomosis via the facial vein on the one hand and the external jugular vein on the other. Insertion of 2 Redon drains. Folding back of the apron flap and completion of suturing to the tracheostoma. Two-layer wound closure. At the end, another Doppler check in the area of the anastomosis and marking of the venous limb and the arterial limb for postoperative Doppler control. At the very end, another transoral inspection of the graft. This shows a very good blood supply to the graft. The operation is completed without difficulty.

Then, entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the tumor on the right side in the hypopharynx. The tumor is located on the medial wall of the hypopharynx and on the aryepiglottic fold. It is approx. 2 x 2 cm in size and exophytic, it can be easily adjusted, hence the decision to perform laser resection, which is then carried out. The tumor is now positioned with the spread laryngoscope and the edges of the incision are marked with a safety margin of 1.5 cm. The mucosa is then incised with the laser using 2 watts, then the laser intensity is increased to 3.5 watts and the tumor is lasered out. Care is taken to ensure that there is also a sufficient safety margin basally. In some cases, the tumor must be lasered down to the thyroid cartilage. The tumor specimen is then removed and marked in situ using a clip. The specimen is placed on cork and completely thread-marked for the frozen section. All margins are marked as R0 in the frozen section. Neck dissection on the right: repositioning of the patient by the surgeon. Injection in the area of the skin incision two fingers below the lower jaw. Care is taken to cut along the old scar line. Skin incision in the area of the old skin incision. Exposure of the platysma. This is difficult, as a clear scarring of the tissue can be seen in the area of the skin incision in the case of previous surgery. Identification of the platysma margin and subplatysmal dissection at the cranial and caudal wound margins for mobilization. Identification of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and sharp dissection along the anterior margin in depth. Identification of the omohyoid muscle and sharp dissection along the muscle cranially to the hyoid bone. Identification of the submandibular gland and opening of the capsule. Carefully hold the capsule away cranially and dissect along the digastric muscle to the hyoid bone. The medial neck preparation is subtly detached from the subsurface under constant bipolar coagulation. Identification of the jugular vein and sharp dissection on the vein from caudal to cranial, so that the neck preparation is divided at the lateral-medial part. Removal of the medial neck preparation after ligation of the facial vein. Exposure of the accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Gradual detachment of the lateral neck preparation from cranial to caudal, starting at level IIb while constantly protecting the surrounding structures, especially the accessorius nerve. There is a lymph node metastasis in the area of level IIb as well as in level III on the right side. The neck preparation is detached from cranial to caudal. Minor bleeding is coagulated bipolarly. The basal resection border is formed by the deep cervical fascia and the cervical plexus. The operation is completed without complications despite the overall very difficult dissection conditions due to the significant tissue scarring. Neck dissection on the left: Skin incision in a horizontal skin fold and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Separation of the platysma and subplatysmal dissection. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and exposure of this. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle up to the cranial side of the digaster muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Locate the gl. submandibularis and expose the gland. Fold up the gland and expose the digaster muscle. Dissection in the direction of level IIb.

This is located in the piriform sinus and just reaches the aryepiglottic fold or arytenoid cartilage. Due to the location, resection with preservation of the larynx was planned and possible. Flap coverage also necessary. Patient was informed about ...........operative necessities.","First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The exophytic tumor is visible, which extends to the middle of the lateral wall of the left piriform sinus and extends medially to the arytenoid fold, but stops short of the arytenoid cartilage. The postcricoid area is not significantly involved. Tip of piriform sinus free macroscopically. Indication for surgery confirmed. The patient is now repositioned with all relevant surgical areas covered and disinfected. Firstly, insertion of the PEG: insertion of the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach, where no special features can be seen on rough inspection. After establishing the diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube without complications in a typical manner. Fixation to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Subsequent insertion of an apron flap in the typical manner. Then start of radical neck dissection on the left: Large lymph node metastasis or the metastatic conglomerate, which has grown together with the sternocleidomastoid muscle and with the soft tissue in depth, is revealed. Successive dissection of the lymph node conglomerate. The internal and external carotid arteries can be dissected. The superior thyroid artery must be dissected. The facial vein must be removed, as well as signs of infiltration into the internal jugular vein, which must also be resected. The vagus nerve is also firmly attached to the tumor in the middle area and visibly infiltrated, therefore it is also resected in the middle area. The accessory nerve cannot be preserved either. The hypoglossal nerve can be dissected and preserved. Dissection of the specimen together with all affected lymph nodes. Some branches of the cervical plexus are also affected, which must also be resected. However, the majority of the plexus can be preserved. All in all, levels II to V are removed. The muscles are then removed from the hyoid bone. The hyoid bone is resected for a better overview. Entering the pharyngeal tube above the epiglottis. Exposure of the tumor. The carcinoma can be seen, which is cut around with a safety margin of 2 to 2 ˝ cm, caudally even up to 3 cm. The pharyngeal wall falls from the tonsil pole to the tip of the sinus and medially from the area of the vallecula to the posterior wall. The tumor preparation shows a tumor cone in the direction of the laryngeal skeleton, but this can be dissected off in healthy tissue. The arytenoid cartilage is partially de-epithelialized at the edge. Here the tumor is somewhat closer than at the other margins, therefore a separate marginal sample is taken from the vallecula over the arytenoid region down to the piriform sinus entrance. Likewise, a marginal sample is taken basally from the soft parts of the larynx where the tumor cone reached. The tumor specimen is also sent in thread-marked for frozen section. Both edge samples are healthy, in the area of the tumor preparation there is still small, infiltrating tumor growth towards the tip of the sinus, where the largest safety distance was. Therefore, another approx. 1 cm wide marginal sample is taken from this area, which is marked remote from the tumor. No more infiltrates in the frozen section. However, there is moderate dysplasia in the entire mucosal area at the edge. Overall, a satellite-like, wallpaper-like, mosaic-like growth can be assumed. Due to the locally existing R0 resection, however, no more resections. Excision biopsy of a calcified thyroid nodule from the left lobe. Now palpation of the thyroid nodule on the left side. This is approx. 1.5 cm in diameter. Hard consistency. The tumor is now removed from the left lobe of the thyroid gland via an incision. Then careful hemostasis and closure of the thyroid lobe with 2-0 Vicryl single button sutures. The neck is now dissected on the right side: after exposing the omohyoid, digastric and sternocleidomastoid muscles, levels II to IV and parts of V a and b are removed. The internal and external carotid arteries and outgoing arteries as well as the facial vein, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve and the branches of the cervical plexus are all exposed and preserved. Surgery was performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequent tracheostoma creation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: After cutting the infrahyoid muscles, the thyroid isthmus is exposed. This is passed underneath, clamped off, severed and supplied in a typical manner using puncture ligatures. The trachea is then exposed. A modified, broadly pedicled Björk flap is created between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage. This is first epithelialized caudally. Subsequent reintubation. Tracheotomy was already performed before the final tumor resection. Then, after ensuring R0 resection, flap removal on the left forearm: Marking of the flap size, this is 10 x 8 cm. Marking of a skin monitor. Then first cut around the flap and the skin monitor as well as subcutaneous tissue subfascially from the ulna, then extend the incision into the crook of the elbow ..................................... Exposure of the superficial venous system with connection to the deep venous system. Subsequent incision of the flap from radial, subfascial. Exposure of the superficial cutaneous antebrachial nerve. Then exposure of the radial artery distally. Clamping of this. This is done for approx. 10 minutes, with stable saturation. Further removal of the flap in between. The radial artery is then removed. This is treated proximally and distally using 4-0 Prolene stitches. Lifting of the flap subfascially. Smaller arteries extending from the pedicle are clipped or bipolar coagulated. Dissection including the superficial venous system and the deep pedicle. A good but clearly medially located cephalic vein with 2 ends can be dissected in the antecubital fossa. The radial artery is dissected up to the entrance to the brachial artery. After clamping, the interosseous artery is left for a few minutes and closed with clips. The artery is then removed first. This is closed with 6-0 Vascufil sutures towards the brachial artery. Clamp and ligature the veins. The flap is then flushed with heparin solution. The arm is then closed in layers in the cranial area after careful hemostasis. A 0.7 to 0.8 mm thick split-thickness skin graft was obtained from the thigh, which is now successively incorporated into the forearm defect. Here complete closure. Sewing on swabs. Application of octenidine gel and application of cloud compresses. Then wrap with absorbent cotton. Fitting of a Kramer splint and fixation with an elastic bandage. Re-application of the arm. Saturation always close to or at 100% until the end of the operation. Subsequent insertion of the flap into the defect. The flap is inserted in such a way that the stalk on the opposite side can be anastomosed with the vessels. Successive suturing of the flap into the defect, partly with the sutures in place, using 3-0 Vicryl single-button sutures. The defect is closed without tension. The stalk is transferred to the opposite side. The superior thyroid artery is shown here. This is sutured to the radial artery after appropriate conditioning using 8-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Due to the different lumen, this must be done twice before a ......................... pulsation of the pedicle can be achieved. Then dissection of the 2 venous outlets from the superficial venous system and 2 outlets from the area of the facial vein. After conditioning, the first larger vein is anastomosed with the outgoing facial vein using a 4-0 coupler. The smaller outlet is also anastomosed with the smaller outlet from the stalk using a 2.5 mm coupler. Good venous return after opening the clamps in each case, positive smear phenomenon. After completion of the vascular anastomoses, strong pulse in the pedicle area and venous return. Subsequent positioning of the pedicle, careful irrigation and hemostasis. Wound closure by retraction of the apron flap. Caudal completion of the epithelialization of the stoma. Lateral cervical closure on the left by placing a Redon drainage, on the right by placing 2 flaps. Re-intubation and insertion of an 8 mm tracheostomy tube. This is fixed with sutures. At the end of the operation, arterial and venous flow could be observed very well with the Doppler. The skin monitor was sutured into the apron flap via a small incision in the ventral neck skin without tension and also showed a very good aspect. The procedure was completed without complications. Patient received Unacid 3 g preoperatively and again during the operation. Antibiotics should be continued for 1 week. Nutrition should be provided via the PEG tube already in place for at least 10 days. Then gruel should be swallowed and, if necessary, the diet should be built up. Heparin perfusor therapy started intraoperatively at 500 units per hour should be continued postoperatively for 5 days. Doppler control according to the scheme for 5 days incl. assessment of the skin monitor. Change the dressing on the forearm, if possible, only after 5 to 7 days. The hydrogel thigh bandage that was finally applied can be left in place for 3 to 4 days or changed depending on the findings. Please loosen the PEG the next day in the typical manner. Wait for the histology from the left lobe of the thyroid gland and then proceed according to the findings. Overall cT2 to 3 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the left with infiltration up to the edge of the larynx. Therefore, the epiglottis margin, aryepiglottic fold, vallecula and parts of the laryngeal skeleton were also removed. Flap coverage by means of a radial flap. Extensive left cervical lymph node metastasis. Therefore, postoperative presentation in the interdisciplinary tumor conference on the question of postoperative radiochemotherapy. Due to the surgical measures, initiate swallowing rehabilitation at an early stage.","Transoral tumor resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Overall removal of levels II to V with dissection and preservation of the structures as on the opposite side. Subsequently, careful hemostasis and irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution on both sides. No more bleeding on final inspection. Wound closure in layers on both sides and insertion of a Redon drain. Re-intubation and insertion of an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube. Overall cT2 to 3 squamous cell carcinoma of the vallecula or epiglottis and supraglottic area. Positive lymph node on the right. PEG tract loosening after 24 hours in a typical manner. Then initially nutrition via PEG. Continue antibiotics for a total of 2 days postoperatively with Unacid. At least temporary dysphagia to be expected, therefore early swallowing training, if necessary presentation to swallowing rehab.

Sonographically cN2c neck status, in CT imaging cN0 neck status. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical treatment was decided.","After induction of anesthesia and preparation of the patient by the anesthesia colleagues, a pharyngoscopy is first performed to determine the current extent of the tumor. As described above, the tumor was found to be a superficial exophytic process in the area of the upper right tonsil lobe, beginning to grow uvularly. The base of the uvula is clearly infiltrating and also growing over the left posterior palatal arch towards the left tonsil. In addition, there are wide, island-like suspicious findings distributed over the soft palate, some of which could already be confirmed as invasive carcinoma in the panendoscopy, partly leukoplakic, partly exophytic mucosal changes, which are primarily located at the mucosal level. First of all, the PEG was inserted. For this purpose, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy to see through to the stomach. If diaphanoscopy is good, the stomach can be punctured and the PEG tube inserted using the usual suture pull-through method. The patient is then prepared for definitive resection. Transenorally, first turn to tumor resection. Cutting around the tumor process with the electric needle, later using the dissection technique. The right tonsil is resected in the sense of a radical tonsillectomy. The resection reveals suspicious changes at the mucosal level, including large areas of the posterior palatal arch, which is therefore completely resected up to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Subtotal resection of the soft palate, here partly nodular changes in the area of the mucosa, but no dorsal wall penetration. Tonsillectomy is performed here due to the growth just before the left tonsil. In addition, the tumor is removed and resected en bloc to the extent described. The tumor is now completely imaged at the mucosal level with marginal samples, which are diagnosed in the frozen section diagnostics as completely free of tumor and dysplasia with a clear R0 situation. The graft is now measured with configuration for almost complete replacement of the soft palate and tonsil lobe. The neck dissection and elevation of the radialis graft are now performed in staggered fashion. First turn to the neck dissection of the left side. Here the skin incision is made at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, curved. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and gastric muscle after exposure of the submandibular gland. Dissection of the anterior neck preparation with exposure and protection of the cervical artery, the superior thyroid artery, the facial vein and the hypoglossal nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, visualization of the accessorius nerve. Numerous nodules of somewhat conspicuous size can be seen in the course of the vein, but without infiltrative growth. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Subsequent evacuation of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Caudal check for lymphatic dryness. Careful inspection and palpation of all wound cavities and surfaces, followed by wound irrigation and insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Then turn to the opposite side. The procedure is basically the same here. Curved skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platyma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digasatric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the cervical sinus, the hypoglossal nerve and the facial vein in the region of the neck. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Subsequent evacuation of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Here too, in the area of the vein course, several nodules, somewhat conspicuous in number and size, without definite malignancy criteria. This is followed by transection and resection of the venter anterior digastric muscle, exposure of the styloid and performance of the pharyngotomy, partial resection and opening of the musculature and creation of a sufficient tunnel for displacement of the pedicle. Now to lift the radialis graft. The patient had a chainsaw injury with reconstruction of the hand, but the radial artery had already been correctly positioned preoperatively. No scarring along the course here either. Marking of the graft in a special configuration. Performing the graft elevation in bloodlessness. Incision of the graft. Exposure of the cephalic vein. Perform the Haydn maneuver to identify the superficial ramus, radial nerve, which must be partially removed in the area of a transverse hand arch. The main trunk can be preserved. Identification of the distal vascular pedicle. Separation after ligation. Ulnar dissection with exposure of the flexor carpi ulnaris. Strict superfacial release of the graft. Dissection of the pedicle including the cephalic vein. Exposure of the radial artery, very high exit of the ulnar artery. Exposure of the common interosseous artery, which is spared. Exposure of the venous bridge to the........ system. Therefore, use the cephalic vein for subsequent anastomosis. Reopening of the vena cava. Regular and complete hand perfusion and excellent graft perfusion are immediately apparent. After careful hemostasis, placement of the graft, later careful two-layer wound closure with incorporation of the full-thickness skin lifted from the right groin. Subsequent application of the vacuum pump and placement of the Cramer splint in the functional site with subsequent repositioning of the arm. Full-thickness skin removal from the right groin. To do this, cut around a piece of skin measuring approx. 12 x 5 cm, strictly cutaneous lifting. Subcutaneous mobilization afterwards. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and, if the wound was dry, strong and multi-layered wound closure. The graft was incorporated at the same time. Good fit with intact conditions on all sides. Pedicle positioning and conditioning. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery and facial artery. Performing the arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon, this is considerably more difficult due to the caliber and difference, but is ultimately successful with immediate regular venous return. Measuring a size 3.5 coupler and performing a venous anastomosis with the coupler. Subsequently, regular perfusion and pulsation with excellent enoral flap perfusion. Postoperatively, please abstain from food for 7 days, then gradually build up the diet. Intraoperative R0 resected cT3 oral cavity carcinoma. Extension of adjuvant therapy depending on lymph node status.","Tonsillectomy, Neck dissection, PEG placement, Flap coverage (Radial)

The large tumor is seen in the area of the postcricoidal section extending to the border of the esophageal entrance, but not infiltrating it. Due to the location and size of the tumor, laser resection does not make sense for functional reasons, as the indication for laryngectomy is now confirmed. Due to the location, it may also be necessary to cover the defect with a flap, especially in the direction of the esophageal entrance. Therefore, these regions are now also covered. First inject 10 ml of Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into each side of the neck and cover sterilely. Subsequently apron flap in the typical manner. Neck dissection on the left: A large cranial lymph node conglomerate is seen. Radical neck dissection is necessary to remove this. Resection of the cranial and inferior sternocleidomastoid muscle and removal of the digastric muscle follows. The hypoglossal nerve moves into the tumor and cannot be preserved, nor can the accessorius nerve. The internal jugular vein is double ligated cranially and caudally. The common carotid artery is also dissected from the lymph node conglomerate cranially and medially. Relatively firm adherence here. However, it is possible to dissect the tumor macroscopically in healthy tissue. A marginal sample is taken from the area of the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery on the carotid artery wall and sent for frozen section. No clear tumor infiltrates in the frozen section. The vagus nerve and border cord can be preserved. Level II to V excision follows, partly including the cervical plexus. As part of the evacuation of the anterior neck, the facial nerve also had to be ligated. Neck dissection on the right by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, PJ: After creation of the apron flap, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland, the accessory nerve, anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, posterior belly of the digaster, cervical vascular sheath. The anterior neck preparation is first performed and completely detached from the omohyoid and cervical vascular sheath, below the submandibular gland. This is then skeletonized and the posterior venter of the digaster muscle is traced. The cervical vascular sheath is now dissected from below so that the neck preparation can be folded laterally from II to V. Macroscopically clear metastases are removed. The facial vein is cut and ligated. Now the neck preparation is successively detached from level II b to V b after all borders have been exposed. The accessory nerve and the cervical plexus are preserved. Removal of the neck preparation without a chyle fistula. Punctual hemostasis. Slightly larger venous and arterial branches are treated by ligation. The ACE, ACI, ACC, internal jugular vein remain intact. Also the vagus and hypoglossal nerves. At this point, the operation is handed over to <CLINICIAN_NAME> to perform the layngectomy, placement of the Provox prosthesis and tracheostomy. Subsequent laryngectomy: First isolate hyoid bone. pre-epiglottic fatty tissue is retracted into the tumor preparation. Infrahyoid muscles are dissected caudally from the hyoid bone and cut caudolaterally. The superior chorda is isolated on both sides, the constrictor muscle is separated on both sides. Further dissection on the inner side of the thyroid cartilage on both sides. The thyroid lobe is dissected off caudolaterally on both sides. The isthmus is severed and treated with stitches. A tracheotomy is then created. Re-intubation. Now enter cranially at the level of the epiglottis. Incision of the epiglottis of the arytenoid fold. Incision of the tumor in the postcricoid area with a distance of at least 1-1 1/2 cm on all sides. Subsequent removal of the larynx at the trachea directly subglottically. Take a marginal sample from the caudal area towards the esophageal entrance. Diesel suture-marked for frozen section together with the entire tumor specimen. Cranial tumor infiltrates are still questionable in the frozen section, therefore a 1 cm wide resection is performed in the transition to the cranial epiglottis at the base of the tongue as well as a marginal sample, which is now tumor-free. Thus R0 situation in the area of the pharyngeal tube. Now myotomy on the left side up to the last fiber. Insertion of an 8 mm Provox prosthesis in the typical manner. Then decision to elevate a pectoralis major flap as the esophageal entrance would become too narrow after suturing and the swallowing function would no longer be intact. Therefore, the dimensions of the pectoralis major flap were measured. Length 8 cm, maximum width 6 cm. Marking on the chest wall. Axillary skin incision. Creation of a tunnel in the area below the deltopectoral flap facially. The tunnel is created up to the lower borders of the neck wound. Subsequent incision of the skin island and the underlying muscle. Repeated application of several shear sutures. Finally, develop the flap along the course of the pedicle up to the clavicle, always keeping it under control. Push the flap through. Successive suturing of the skin flap into the defect with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures completely tension-free after loosening the anti-shear sutures. Musculature is stitched over it in a further row of sutures. This is done in particular towards the base of the tongue and laterally. Followed by careful irrigation. Hemostasis. Layered wound closure of the neck wounds with insertion of Redon drains and the thoracic wound also with insertion of 2 Redon drains. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma here too. Insertion of a 9 mm tracheostomy tube. A nasogastric tube was also inserted during the procedure. The procedure was completed without complications. Patient admitted to intensive care unit for monitoring. Postoperative continuation of the intraoperatively administered antibiotics with Unacid. Feeding via gastric tube for 10-12 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Wait for the final histology, especially in the area of the extensive tissue removal in the area of the common carotid artery. Overall presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference. In N3b status, radiochemotherapy should be given in all cases.","Tumor resection, Right-sided neck dissection, Defect coverage, Pedicled flap (Pectoralis major), Provox prosthesis

Repositioning the MLE tube and changing the MLE tube so that the anterior commissure can be exposed with the smallest MLE tube (size D). Clinically, it is clearly possible to cut around the tumor in healthy tissue, whereby large parts of the subglottic slope and the vocalis muscle are also resected. In the area of the anterior commissure, the cartilage is exposed in a circumscribed manner. As far as can be assessed intraoperatively, the tumor can be completely resected in the healthy tissue.

The patient also complains of dysphagia and odynophagia. She has also lost more than 5 kg in weight in the last 2-3 months. There is an indication for the above-mentioned operation.,"Transfer of the patient to the operating theater and positioning of the patient. Introductory consultation with the anesthesiologist and performance of the team time-out. Start with induction of ileus, for this reason tracheoscopy is omitted after consultation with anesthesia. Now esophagoscopy. This shows the small stomach filled with blood clots. No active bleeding or mass can be seen. On retraction, the entire length of the oesophagus is seen with a whitish coating and some reddish areas, but without evidence of deeper erosion or bleeding. Now panendoscopy. Inspection of the oral cavity reveals an ulcer approx. 1 1/2 cm long on the posterior palatal arch, which can be palpated as slightly hardened, and the upper tonsil pole on the left side is palpable. The palatal arch or glossotonsillar groove, tonsillar lobe and tongue are free on the right side. The base of the tongue is also palpable. The vallecula and epiglottis are also inconspicuous, as are the posterior and lateral pharyngeal walls. The piriform sinus can be opened very well on both sides. The postcricoid region also opens well and is free. In Cormack I, the vocal folds are easily adjustable up to the anterior commissure and are also inconspicuous. The Mc Ivor blade is now inserted and the mass removed by excisional biopsy with the helium laser. Care is taken to ensure that there is an approx. 1 cm margin around the mass. The left half of the uvula is missing. The tonsil itself is very small and remains intact. The specimen is marked with sutures and a resection is made in the lateral part if the mucosa hardens. The frozen section shows an invasive squamous cell carcinoma resected in sano. A piece of hardened mucosa that does not appear suspicious is resected as a lateral resection and sent for final histology. After a second look, there is no evidence of bleeding in the tonsil lobe. After a final consultation with the anesthesiologist, the operation is terminated. The patient should be presented at the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Excisional biopsy, Panendoscopy

At the beginning of the operation, insertion with the flexible esophagogastroscope. Pre-viewing into the stomach. If diaphanoscopy is good, the PEG is inserted using the thread pull-through method. This is successful without any problems. Positioning the tumor. The tumor is relatively difficult to access. It is located in the glossotonsillar groove with transition to the base of the tongue. The patient has very protruding teeth, so the tumor can only be adjusted to a medium degree. The tumor itself is blurred and can hardly be distinguished from the rest of the tissue. Therefore, extremely difficult conditions for the laser resection requested by the tumor board and the patient. Nevertheless, the tumor was successfully resected first in the caudal region and then in the cranial region. Switching on the microscope and the laser. Start of laser resection with 5 watts in the caudal area. Then pre-laser cranially and laterally. The tumor can be removed in its entirety. At the end, marginal samples are taken and sent for frozen section. All marginal samples are tumor-free. The final specimen is placed on cork and sent to the pathology department.

Clear destruction of the cartilage on CT. Laryngectomy was therefore indicated.,"Preparation and intubation by anesthesia colleagues. First positioning of the patient, preliminary consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. First perform a pharyngo-laryngoscopy. This involves entering with the Kleinsasser tube under dental protection. The tumorous process is seen in the endolaryngeal region, particularly anteriorly located with infiltration of both vocal folds and clear growth towards the laryngeal skeleton. Therefore, in conjunction with the CT diagnosis, confirmation of the indication for laryngectomy. No evidence of infiltration of the supraglottic structures and extension towards the hypopharynx. Here, all mucosa is unremarkable and tumor-free. A nasogastric feeding tube was then inserted under pharyngoscopic control. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. Dissection of an apron flap. Exposure of both sides of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Due to the course, the facial vein is removed in good time. Neck dissection performed first. Start with the left side. Here, after exposure of the omohyoid muscle, free preparation of the internal jugular vein, exposure of the vagus nerve, common carotid artery, clearing of the anterior neck preparation while carefully protecting the cervical anus, the hypoglossal nerve and the superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and en bloc removal of the neck preparation. All exposed nerve structures are returned to their tissue bed after release. Exactly the same procedure on the opposite side. Here too, the accessorius nerve, vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve are exposed. Subsequent neurolysis and re-embedding of the structures. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein and, together with level VI, removal of the neck preparation en block. Skeletonization of the laryngeal skeleton and release on both sides of the piriform sinus, release of the hyoid. This is followed by the trachatomy. This is done between the cricoid cartilage and the first tracheal ring. The thyroid isthmus is severed for this purpose. Successive release of the left thyroid lobe, which was clearly conspicuous due to nodules measuring up to 2 cm. This can be correlated well with the sonographic findings intraoperatively. Visualization of the recurrent nerve. Ligation of the thyroid gland close to the capsule. Ligation of the superior and inferior thyroid artery and the middle thyroid vein. The tumor is then resected. This involves entering the center of the vallecula, looping the epiglottis and successively widening the pharyngeal access. Mucosa-sparing resection and release of the laryngeal skeleton and removal of the laryngeal skeleton below the cricoid cartilage. Careful inspection. The glottic laryngeal carcinoma is exclusively endolaryngeal. This results in a safe in sano resection. The Provox prosthesis is then placed using the usual pull-through method. This is successful without any problems. Insertion of a 6 mm prosthesis. The paramedian myotomy is then performed in the area of the upper esophageal sphincter. Later, the sternal attachments of the sternocleidomastoid muscle are cut on both sides. The pharyngeal suture is then performed inverted and in multiple layers. Subsequently, insertion of a 10-gauge redon drain in each case. Careful two-layer wound closure and suturing of the tracheostoma. Subsequent problem-free transfer to a size 10 low-cuff cannula and completion of the procedure without any indication of complications.","Laryngectomy, Functional bilateral neck dissection, Provox placement, Hemithyroidectomy

On CT, there is evidence of esophageal infiltration, a breakthrough through the thyroid cartilage is clearly visible, so that there is an indication for laryngectomy and probable partial pharyngectomy with flap plasty.","First head positioning. Pharyngoscopy after insertion of the mouthguard. An exophytic mass is seen starting at the entrance to the hypopharynx, growing into the endolarynx and affecting both sides of the glottic plane. Caudally, the tumor extends to the upper esophageal orifice. An infiltration cannot be ruled out with complete certainty after multiple diagnostic assessments and consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, but resection appears to be possible here. In summary of all findings, decision to proceed with curative surgical treatment. Skin disinfection without infiltration anesthesia in known CHD. Formation of an apron flap. Double ligation of the external jugular vein. Dissection with exposure of both submandibular glandulae. Rearrangement and neck dissection on the left side: Dissection of the sternocleidomastoid. Finding the accessorius nerve, which is spared in the further course. From caudal to cranial then development of the lateral neck preparation with removal of regions V, IV, III, II and Ib. The jugular vein, the accessorius nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, the superior thyroid artery and the carotid artery are freed from connective tissue structures and their course is visualized, identified and spared. The superior thyroid artery is dissected after its caudal exit, doped and stitched. The superior laryngeal nerve is also identified as it enters the larynx together with the accompanying vessels and removed. Now mobilize the lateral laryngeal skeleton. Separate the infralaryngeal muscles and strike downwards. Mobilization of the left thyroid pole from the laryngeal skeleton, beating laterally after separation and ligation of the isthmus. Exposure of the left-sided hyoid bone. Exposure of the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage and the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage as well as the superior cornu. This is exposed and the constrictor, already pushed off on the inside, in preparation for the laryngectomy step. Transfer to the opposite side after hemostasis. Identical procedure on the right side. Identification of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the accessorius nerve. Protection of both structures during the procedure. The vascular sheath and the internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery are also shown here. Cranial placement of the borders with identification of the digastric muscle through the apron flap. Dissection from caudal to cranial in levels V, IV and III. It can now be seen that a metastatic conglomerate of 3 nodes is located in the jugulofacial angle on the internal jugular vein and appears to infiltrate it. It is not possible to dissect the conglomerate from the vein sharply or bluntly without risking a lesion. Therefore, cranially locate the end of the vein and caudally remove the conglomerate after double ligation and repositioning. Identification of the hypoglossal nerve. This is also spared in the further course. Completion of the neck in levels II and III and ventral removal of connective tissue. The infralaryngeal musculature is not removed here, as infiltration by underlying tumor parts cannot be ruled out. Dissection of the carotid and residual venous parts as well as the vagus nerve, which are folded further laterally and spared, and mobilization of the constrictor muscles caudally. Now repositioning for tracheotomy. Exposure of the surgical site caudally. Insertion into the trachea between the 1st and 2nd tracheal clasp. Placement of 2 holding sutures. Further mobilization of the left thyroid lobe caudally and mobilization of the laryngeal preparation from the left and right. For this purpose, also identify the right-sided hyoid bone parts and separate them sharply with the electric knife. Also on the right side, attempt to expose the cornu superius of the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, but this is not done due to the large tumor so as not to open the tumor. In the median plane, entry into the pre-epiglottic fatty tissue. Identification of the epiglottis and disluxation with the tumor grasping forceps. Now, starting from the healthy side, release the laryngectomy specimen from cranial to caudal with the right-sided hypopharyngeal carcinoma inside. Under visualization and leaving a macroscopically healthy mucosa and muscle layer, consecutive removal under bipolar coagulation. The specimen is submitted as a whole for frozen section and R0 diagnosis. The specimen grows to the left side before entering the upper esophageal sphincter, so that only a small pharyngeal tube remains here. According to <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the pathology department, parts of a carcinoma in situ are still found at the lateral central resection margin, so that 2 resections are taken here as a margin sample. As further resection is not possible under any circumstances, we do not wait for a frozen section diagnosis, but continue with the operation and send the samples for urgent histological processing. The decision is now made to cover the defect using a pectoralis major flap: Marking of the blood vessel supply and the medially overlying skin island, which is measured beforehand. First incision at the lateral edge of the pectoralis major and identification of the supplying arterial areas. Then cut around the skin area caudally. Adaptation with Vicryl sutures of the flap epithelium with the muscle. Mobilization of a tunnel and connection to the neck access under constant view of the supplying artery. Fluxing through the flap and now double-layer inverted suturing of the flap and the resection area at all points. A T-shaped suture is first created at the base of the tongue to enable tension-free suturing. The remaining adaptation is now very successful. In the cranial area towards the base of the tongue, a third row of sutures for complete wound closure. Now complete the tracheostoma suture using Ethibond. Two-layer wound closure after placement of Redon drains in the flap removal area. Two-layer wound closure on both cervical sides after placement of 2 Redon drains. On the right cervical side in the area of the flap pedicle, the skin is not closed in order to avoid compression of the feeding vessels. Lomatuell is applied here. The patient received Unacid 3 g every 8 hours intraoperatively; this should be continued for 5 days. As far as swallowing function is concerned, with subsequent radiotherapy, complaints are certainly to be expected in the context of this maximum reconstruction. The gastric tube should be removed between the 7th and 10th postoperative day after an X-ray pre-swallow. In any case, postoperative radiotherapy if borderline in sano resection is possible at all. Voice rehabilitation can be attempted by means of ructus, but here too the chances of success are rather critical. Termination of the operation.","Neck revision with submandibulectomy

This reveals a tumor of the left anterior palatal arch, the tonsil, which then extends over the vallecula to the hypopharynx. However, the piriform sinus of the left side is completely omitted by the tumor. The same applies to the entire right side of the hypopharynx and oropharynx. The tumor certainly does not reach the midline of the soft palate. From the tonsil, the tumor passes slightly onto the glossotonsillar groove. First adjust and expose the tumor with the FK retractor. Then start resection at the anterior palatal arch. From here, dissection down to the tonsil, which is then resected with tissue surrounding the tonsil capsule in the sense of a tumor tonsillectomy. The pharyngeal musculature is exposed. There is no evidence of deep tumor growth. The tumor is then developed further caudally. Here resection of the glossotonsillar groove with transition of the resection to the base of the tongue. A part of the base of the tongue is also resected here. Further dissection then caudally, towards the hypopharynx, where the tumor can then be safely removed at the entrance to the piriform sinus. Now take samples from the margins at the entrance to the piriform sinus, the anterior and posterior margins and the base of the tongue. It then becomes apparent that the tumor reaches the lingual epiglottis via the vallecula, so that a corresponding part of the lingual epiglottis is resected here as well. Now also take a marginal sample at the resection margin of the epiglottis. The area of the entrance of the piriform sinus at the front and at the epiglottis is then assessed by the pathologist as a carcinoma in situ in the frozen section, so that another resection is performed here. A resection is then performed on the epiglottis and the anterior piriform sinus entrance. If the mucosal aspect is absolutely inconspicuous macroscopically, the corresponding marginal samples are taken again from the epiglottis and the anterior piriform sinus entrance. When the marginal sample is taken, there is a somewhat heavier bleeding here from the depths, which can only be controlled with difficulty using monopolar coagulation. The area of the resection site can now hardly be exposed with the FK retractor, so that it is then decided not to carry out any further resection in depth, regardless of the result of the histological findings of the frozen section examination. If the wound is dry, all instruments are then removed. Then reposition the patient by tracheotomy. Perform a pretracheal transverse incision and then dissect in layers in depth. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Then separate the infrahyoid and infralaryngeal muscles at the midline. Clamping of the thyroid isthmus and separation of the thyroid muscle as well as bilateral repositioning. Then expose the anterior surface of the trachea, open the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp, prepare a Björk flap and then suture the tracheostoma in a circular fashion, followed by reintubation onto an 8-gauge cannula. The intraoperative frozen section at the epiglottis is then assessed as tumor-free. The frozen section in the area of the resection site on the piriform sinus on the anterior wall is again described as carcinoma in situ. However, since a left neck dissection is required anyway in this patient with a positive lymph node status on the left side of the neck, another transoral laser resection should be performed in the area of the piriform sinus anterior wall on the left side in connection with this procedure. The procedure is therefore completed at this point. After extubation, the patient returns to the normal ward of the ENT clinic.","Transoral, robot-assisted resection, and Tracheotomy

Intraoperative cT1a extension with questionable transition to the supraglottis. No clearly definable tumor on computed tomography, certainly no cartilage erosion or infiltration. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment was decided.","After induction and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, the Kleinsasser tube is inserted under dental protection after inspection of the inconspicuous oral vestibule. The oral cavity and pharynx are then inspected and found to be normal. Adjustment of the endolarynx with the aid of the surgical microscope. An exophytic, partially ulcerated tumor is seen in the area of the glottis on the right, which grows almost along the entire length of the vocal fold on the right side, the anterior commissure is free. Adherence in the area of the posterior commissure towards Ary, but without further signs of infiltration here. The tumor grows clearly laterally, infiltrates and partially consumes the pocket fold. The ventriculus laryngis is used up. However, the tumor can still be displaced over the fold of the larynx by palpation. Demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and confirmation of the primary surgical procedure. Resection is now performed with the 2-5 Watt laser. Inclusion of the pocket fold, which is almost completely resected, allowing the tumor, which clearly infiltrates the ventriculis laryngis in depth, to be resected in sano. Subtotal resection of the paralaryngeal musculature. Finally, healthy conditions on all sides in depth. Separation in the area of the anterior commissure, leaving a minimal residual vocal fold anteriorly on the right. Dorsal resection including the vocal process. The tumor is attached to the vocal process. However, complete mobilization and exclusion of further arytenoid infiltration by resection of the processus. Removal of the tumor in toto. Careful hemostasis. Subsequent representative marginal sampling in all planes, especially in the paraglottic direction and in the area of the arytenoid. All marginal samples are free of dysplasia and tumors in the frozen section diagnostics, so that an R0 situation can be assumed here. Final inspection and with absolutely dry and slim glottic conditions, the procedure was completed without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperatively R0 resected cT2 glottic carcinoma on the right. After receiving the definitive histology, discussion of the adjuvant therapy options, also with regard to the extension with infiltration of the pocket fold, in our interdisciplinary tumor conference and if no further measures are taken, a control microlaryngoscopy should be performed in approx. 8 weeks.","Endoscopic laser resection, Microlaryngoscopy

Here, circumscribed growth on the mandibular branch without evidence of mandibular infiltration in the panendoscopy or CT imaging. Now planned resection and defect coverage using a radial flap.","First, perform the PEG insertion. For this purpose, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. Here, with good diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. Inspection of the oesophagus on reflection. No suspicious lesions here. Now enter with the small bore tube and inspect the primary tumor with the small bore tube and the open mouth retractor. There is an exophytic growing tumor in the area of the right anterior palatal arch, passing over the glossotonsillar groove to the base of the tongue and clearly infiltrating it in depth, affecting at least 1/4 of the base of the tongue, but free vallecula and epiglottis caudally. No growth towards the hypopharynx. The tumor extends over the glossotonsillar groove onto the alveolar ridge and is located here coarsely and not displaceable. In this case, the tumor tends to grow submucosally and nodularly and is located at least 3 cm above the mandible. Urgent suspicion of mandibular infiltration here. Tumor extends anteriorly in a bumpy shape. A screening specimen was taken at the anterior margin for frozen section diagnosis. However, no tumor growth here. Now consult <CLINICIAN_NAME> and discuss the case. Confirmation of the overall clear tumor progression and the high degree of suspicion of mandibular infiltration. Therefore, after detailed case discussion, decision to consult the maxillofacial surgeons. Findings demo and case discussion by telephone to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Confirmation of suspected mandibular infiltration. Primary treatment recommendation of continuous partial mandibular resection. Joint case discussion again with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Due to the thinning and lack of adequate curative treatment options for surgical restoration, the decision was made to perform primary surgical restoration with the recommended partial mandibular resection and reconstruction using a scapula flap. Neck dissection and tracheotomy performed first. Start with the neck dissection on the left side: no suspicious masses are described sonographically. Skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Clearing out the anterior neck level while carefully protecting the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve and the cervical sinus. Now expose the internal jugular vein. Free preparation of the vein after prior exposure of the accessorius nerve. Exposure and preservation of the facial vein, the external vein was ligated and removed in the course of the oblique pulling exit. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches and special protection of caudal lymphatic structures. Dry conditions here. Final inspection and in dry conditions, after final palpation of level Ib and inconspicuous conditions, wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and two-layer wound closure after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Now turn to the neck dissection on the opposite side: here sonographically 2 suspicious masses level II to IV. In principle the same procedure. Dissection of skin and subcutaneous tissue, dissection of the platysma, creation of a platysma flap. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This can be removed from the nodular metastatic lesions measuring up to 3 cm on the internal jugular vein. No evidence of muscle infiltration here. Visualization of the omohyoid muscle. Expose the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, cervical artery and hypoglossal nerve. There is no real facial vein here, but there is a very strong superior thyroid vein. Free dissection of the internal jugular vein, including the suspicious lesions. Careful dissection in the area of the vein. Clearly no infiltration of the vessel here, but vulnerable conditions. Outlets close to the vein must be ligated twice. Otherwise problem-free evacuation. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Evacuation of the accessorius triangle and evacuation of level V with careful protection of the plexus branches. Further exposure of the external carotid artery. Exposure of the outlet of the upper laryngeal bundle and the facial vein. Now, due to the expansion, evacuation of level Ib. This is done with the submandibular gland. Careful subcapsular dissection while keeping the branch of the mouth away. Careful dissection and protection of the facial artery. A lymph node measuring a good 1 1/2 cm anterior to the gland is noticeable, otherwise no macroscopically suspicious changes in level Ib. Palpation of the floor of the mouth. No changes here. Now, with dry wound conditions, first turn to the tracheotomy. Make a horizontal incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose and ligate the strong anterior jugular vein in this area. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Dissection of the musculature, exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Bipolar coagulation of the thyroid isthmus and, after complete exposure of the anterior tracheal surface, insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Subsequent problem-free transfer to an 8 mm tracheoflex cannula and fixation of the cannula with suture. Now use <CLINICIAN_NAME> from maxillofacial surgery until osteocutaneous fixation of the graft. The mandibular branch is now sharply visualized. If the course of the mandible is tortuous, remove the facial artery as distally as possible to obtain a strong vascular stump and expose a large area of the mandibular branch ............ of the periosteum and muscle insertions. Exposure of the ascending mandibular branch up to the joint, complete freeing of the mandibular branch from the muscle processes. Now, after complete exposure, saw out approx. 6 cm of mandible after previous fixation with 2.7 from the synthesis plate, which is fixed with 12 and 14 screws. Sawing out the bone portion. This results in a circumscribed detachment of bone in the area of the mandibular angulus. This is later refixed with osteosynthesis and screws. Re-release of the plate. Therefore creation of a wide access. Entering enorally in the area of the anterior floor of the mouth. Successive resection of the tumor, taking the lateral floor of the mouth and the edge of the tongue completely up to the base of the tongue. Here, generous resection with resection of approx. 1/3 of the base of the tongue. Macroscopically and palpatorily clearly healthy. Resection towards the soft tissues of the cheek well within the healthy tissue. Resection of the tumor including the anterior palatal arch and the tonsil as far as the parauvular region, but sparing the posterior palatal arch. After caudal resection up to just before the epiglottis and also here resection of the tumor clearly in healthy tissue. Now, after extirpation of the tumor, a clear in sano resection can be seen macroscopically. Only in the area of the anterior floor of the mouth macroscopically somewhat scarce resection. Therefore, a strong resection is performed in the area of the anterior floor of the mouth. Finally, the tumor area is completely covered with continuous margin samples. These are sent for frozen section diagnostics and assessed here as completely free of tumor and dysplasia. Therefore, after meticulous hemostasis, sterile packing of the wound conditions and repositioning to elevate an osteomyocutaneous scapula flap. A separate dictation from <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the MKG follows. After removal of the graft, preparation of the vascular pedicle. Successive fitting of the bony part. Difficult conditions here, but finally good fitting in the area of the bony margins. After osteosynthetic treatment, insertion of cancellous bone tissue. Final firm fit. Previous transcervical suturing of the cutaneous part in the area of the base of the tongue and the caudal pharyngeal defect as well as beginning in the area of the posterior palatal arch. Attempt to complete the cutaneous suture transorally. This is not successful due to increased tension. Therefore, renewed anterior loosening of the plating. In the meantime, renewed demonstration of findings at <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. With good mobilization of the cutaneous part, problem-free transoral insertion of the graft. Finally, complete defect coverage in the area of the mucosal defect. In the area of the anterior floor of the mouth and the tongue, primary mucosal adaptation is described here, finally also palpably completely dense conditions. Repositioning of the plating. Renewed screwing. Insertion of spongiosis, circumscribed, and attention to microvascular anastomization: For this purpose, initially further exposure of the vascular pedicle. Clipping of vessels close to the stalk. After dissection, positioning of the detached facial artery with approximate caliber equivalence. Excellent flow after free dissection and placement. Free preparation of the vessel and now, after placement, perform end-to-end anastomosis with 8.0 ethinol. This is somewhat more difficult with vessels that are not exactly the same caliber, but is ultimately successful. Initially delayed venous return. After a short run-in phase, however, excellent reflux conditions with enorally regular flap perfusion. Now, after positioning of the arterial anastomosis, the best possible placement conditions for anastomization with the external jugular vein. Therefore, free preparation of the external jugular vein. Deposition after ligation. Free preparation. Measurement of a 3.5 mm coupler and problem-free execution of the coupler anastomosis. After opening the Acland clamps, immediate regular venous filling and excellent flap perfusion. Finally, circumscribed hemostasis in the area of the previously thinned muscle cuff and, in dry conditions and with good flap vitality, careful two-layer wound closure with moderate tension conditions. Due to the large area of exposed musculature in the area of the muscular graft part, the caudal part is left open cervically. Insertion of a flap and suturing and termination of the procedure at this point. Conclusion: Due to the high degree of suspicion of mandibular infiltration and the lack of equivalent curative treatment options, resection of a cT4a cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right with continuity resection of the mandible and reconstruction of the osseous defect as well as reconstruction of the enoral defect with an osseomyocutaneous scapular flap. Due to the extent of the tumor, adjuvant therapy is certainly required. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g. Please continue this postoperatively with Unacid 1.5 g for 3 days. Postoperatively, please monitor the flap meticulously according to the known scheme. Please visit the maxillofacial clinic approx. 1 week postoperatively for an X-ray overview. From the 8th postoperative day, endoscopic check-up and, if flap vitality is normal and the conditions are dense, a clinical swallowing test and, if necessary, oral food preparation. Decannulation if necessary, depending on the diet.","Tumor resection, Neck dissection, Defect reconstruction (Scapula flap), Tracheotomy, PEG placement

Thus indication for the above procedure.,"Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Identification of the patient. Insertion of the Jennings retractor and re-inspection of the tumorous mass. This can be seen on the right side at the transition from the soft palate to the hard palate, but crossing the midline. The tumorous mass is then carefully excised using bipolar coagulation. Here, sufficient attention is paid to a safe distance so that a large part of the mucosa and submucosal tissue is removed from the hard palate, the bone is exposed at this point, taking the soft palate with it. After careful hemostasis, marginal samples are taken. These are submitted for frozen section diagnostics. The patient is then repositioned for neck dissection on both sides. Start on the right side. Repeated cervical skin spray disinfection on both sides and infiltration anesthesia. Skin wipe disinfection and sterile draping. Skin incision on the right side cranially behind the mastoid, anteriorly over the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which ends at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

Performing a microlaryngoscopy, where a broad-based tumor is found relatively centrally in the area of the base of the tongue, which here bulges strongly exophytically into the pharynx. The lateral wall of the pharynx is merely adjacent to the tumor, as is the posterior wall of the pharynx, where there is certainly no infiltration by the tumor. Removal of the MLE tube. Perform gastroscopy and PEG insertion. The flexible instrument can be inserted into the esophagus without any problems, and the tube can be advanced under visualization into the stomach, where a regular folded relief can be seen. After distension of the stomach, a positive diaphanoscopy reveals a good puncture site below the costal arch. Here the PEG tube is placed using the thread pull-through method and with a positive tent phenomenon. This is successful without any problems. Fixation of the PEG tube with the holding plate and dressing. Reflect back and inspect the esophageal mucosa, which is unremarkable. Repositioning of the patient and insertion of the size B small bore tube and exploration of the base of the tongue. This is only insufficiently successful, so the small water tube is changed to the TORS barrier. This allows sufficient exposure of the tumor so that laser resection can now be performed successively. The resection is carried out far into the base of the tongue, as there is considerable infiltration of the tumor here. Due to the complexity, a large part of the exophytic part of the tumor must be resected first. It is now possible to expose the base of the tumor better and to laser the tumor out of the base of the tongue. The tumor is located so centrally that the lingual artery is not endangered on either side, even with deep resection. Representative frozen sections are taken, whereby a marginal sample in the area of the base of the tongue proves to be positive. This area is resected again generously and finally another marginal sample is taken, which is found to be tumor-free by the pathologists in the frozen section during the further course of the resection. Subtle hemostasis. The resection is performed via the vallecula up to the lingual epiglottis surface. The base of the epiglottis is also infiltrated by the tumor. However, the cartilage is certainly affected so that the tumor can ultimately be completely resected while preserving the epiglottis. Representative marginal samples for frozen section diagnostics are also taken from the area of the vallecula and the epiglottis, all of which are found to be tumor-free intraoperatively. Repeated subtle hemostasis. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection on both sides and tracheotomy. Application of local anesthesia on both sides of the neck. Skin ablation of the entire neck and sterile draping. Start on the right side. Creation of a skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle caudally and the digaster muscle (posterior cranial venter). Exposure of the cranial accessorius nerve. Displacement and at the end of the operation re-embedding of the accessorius nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the cranial hypoglossal nerve. Displacement and at the end of the operation re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath from caudal to cranial up to the digaster. Successive removal of the posterior and then anterior neck specimen containing the lymph nodes. Protection of the above-mentioned structures. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Irrigation of the wound using hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Dry conditions. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure dressing. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection on the left. Creation of a skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure and ligation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Dissection along the omohyoid muscle cranially to the hyoid bone and the capsule of the submandibular gland. Cranial exposure of the posterior venter of the digaster muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection along the internal jugular vein, the vagus nerve and the common carotid artery from caudal to cranial up to the digaster. Displacement and at the end of the operation re-embedding of the vagus nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. A highly suspicious lymph node is found in the area of the upper venous angle, which is also removed with the neck preparation. Another suspicious lymph node is found in region IV on the left side. Successive removal of the posterior neck specimen while sparing the above-mentioned structures and the plexus branches. Removal of the anterior neck specimen. Repeated inspection. Irrigation of the wound with hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Dry conditions. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Platysma suture. Single button skin suture. Application of a pressure bandage. Subsequent creation of an approx. 3.5 cm long incision below the cricoid cartilage. Separation of the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of both branches of the anterior jugular vein, which are ligated separately. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Lateral displacement of the prelaryngeal musculature on the right and left. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, which is undermined, clamped and severed. Subsequently, both sides are treated by means of re-stitching. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Creation of a Björ flap in a typical manner after incision between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasp. Creation of a plastic tracheostoma. Skin suture.

PET-CT showed a left tonsil focus. Surgery therefore indicated.,"First of all, another pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: There is no further clinical evidence of a mass, apart from the hardening in the area of the left tonsil. However, a tonsil stone had been retrieved here during the pre-panendoscopy. However, an indurated tonsil was found, the induration also extends into the soft tissue slightly outside the left tonsil. Therefore, clear cutting outside the tonsil border cranially and also laterally as well as to the depth, entraining mucosa and also muscle tissue. Successive removal of the tonsil and attached soft tissue macroscopically clearly in healthy tissue, in the sense of an extended tonsillectomy. Resection caudally to the base of the tongue. The muscles, including the pterygoid muscles, are removed towards the depths. The posterior palatal arch can initially be completely preserved, while the anterior arch is completely resected. Muscle parts in the palatal arch area are also preserved. The specimen is marked with sutures. Separate cranial medial and cranial lateral margin specimens as soft tissue margin specimens. In the frozen section with infiltrations, which form margins in the cranial and medial areas. The two soft tissue margin samples towards the depth are healthy. Therefore, recutting of mucosal strips with attached soft tissue cranially in the entire area and medially. Tumor is marked with suture in each case remote from the tumor. No more infiltrates in the frozen section, so now R0 resection. In view of the situation, neck dissection is now also possible and indicated. Injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline. Sterile draping. Skin incision including the old scar. Laborious dissection through the scar tissue. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the digastric and omohyoid muscles. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure and preservation of the facial vein. Exposure and preservation of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery. Visualization and preservation of the vagus nerve. Extreme scarring anterior to the vein or artery around the facial vein and around the capsule of the submandibular gland. This is dissected free. Level II to V are then evacuated while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Finally, careful hemostasis. Irrigation. Wound closure with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures and 4-0 skin sutures and insertion of a Redon drain. Subsequent enoral inspection. No bleeding. The procedure was completed without complications. Overall cT1 to 2, more likely cT2 tonsillar carcinoma on the left, R0 according to marginal samples. Neck dissection at least cN1.

If the conditions are normal, the patient can be intubated without any problems. Subsequent endoscopy of the patient's oral cavity, pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx, revealing a highly exophytic mass originating from the left tonsil. Cranial to this mass there are smaller exophytic islands in the mucosal level of the soft palate. These do not reach the uvula. Otherwise, the mucosa is completely normal and inconspicuous in the entire mirror area. A representative sample is then taken for frozen section diagnostics. The findings are diagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma. Then insertion of the Olympus retractor and exposure of the tonsil together with the tumor on the left side. Then insertion of the robotic arms and start of the TORS resection. The dissection is also performed using a monopolar spatula. Start of resection on the soft palate. Resection is performed up to the parauvular level. First resection laterally in the region of the anterior palatal arch and then dorsally in the region of the posterior palatal arch. Dissection is performed with subtle hemostasis up to the lower tonsil pole. The tumor is then deposited here with a sufficient safety margin below the lower tonsil pole. The specimen is then thread-marked as a whole for histopathological tissue examination. In the frozen section, the finding of an rCIS finding with micro-islands of invasive carcinoma in the area of the margin of the posterior palatal arch, in particular in the caudal region of the margin extending beyond the middle to the cranial side, is found. Subsequent resection of a strip from the posterior palatal arch to the caudal settling area. A strip of mucosa is then removed as a new representative marginal sample, with the suture markings placed cranially in each case. This new marginal sample is then also found to be tumor-free intraoperatively as a frozen section, so that an R0 resection can now be assumed here. Now that there is a somewhat larger defect in the posterior palatal arch, a uvuloplasty is performed to reconstruct the posterior soft palate. This is then followed by subtle hemostasis and removal of the robotic instruments. After checking the bleeding again, the oral retractor is also removed. The patient is then repositioned for neck dissection on the left side. Here, the skin incision is first made along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then dissect in depth in layers and expose the neck vessel sheath. Free preparation of the cervical vascular sheath and preparation of the lateral neck preparation as well as preparation of all resection borders in the sense of the omohyoid muscle, the capsule of the submandibular gland and the digaster muscle. A suspicious lymph node change can then be seen in the accessorius triangle. This area is then initially removed here in the sense of a level IIa evacuation while sparing the accessorius nerve. Then further development of the entire lateral neck preparation in the sense of level III and IV. Then clearing of the hypoglossal triangle while sparing the hypoglossal nerve and the branches of the external carotid artery and internal jugular artery in the sense of clearing Level Ib and the posterior margin Level Ia. Then complete dissection of the anterior neck preparation in the sense of level V, also with careful dissection of the branches of the external carotid artery and internal jugular artery. Subsequent subtle hemostasis and irrigation of the wound. Insertion of a Redon drain and subsequent two-layer wound closure and dressing. The patient is then extubated without any problems after the procedure has been completed.

The tumor described above can be seen in the area of the left edge of the tongue with a central ulcer. This lump is now carefully surrounded with the electric needle, bipolar coagulation and the pointed scissors and successively removed. This creates a relatively large defect in the area of the left tongue. Finally, the tumor can be removed macroscopically on all sides far into the healthy tissue. The tumor is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. This reveals tumor cell extensions in the area of the anterior specimen and cranially. A large resection is therefore taken from this area.

Clinically and on CT, a tumor infiltrating the front 2/3 of the tongue, including the external tongue muscles, extending just above the midline to the right. Overall cT3-4 findings. Findings confirmed by pharyngoscopy.","This is followed by the PEG insertion. Insertion of the esophagoscope into the stomach. There, during spontaneous diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall probe without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Subsequent transoral tumor resection: tumor is resected on all sides with a safety margin of 1-1.5 cm. Half the tongue is removed. The floor of the mouth is also resected across the midline in the area of the caruncle to the right. The body of the tongue is resected beyond the midline to the right. Resection extends deep into the base of the tongue and also includes parts of the glossoalveolar groove and the beginning of the pharyngeal wall. The lingual nerve is also resected. A. lingualis is ligated. The preparation is thread-marked for the frozen section. No tumor formations in the area of the mucosal margins. In the resection margin basal to medial lateral scarce resection margins, therefore an extended resection of the remaining muscles of the floor of the mouth, external tongue muscles, tongue base muscles and also muscles from the opposite side is obtained. The specimen is suture-marked (sutures remote from the tumor) and sent for frozen section, where there are no more tumor infiltrates. Thus R0 resection. Subsequent repositioning and sterile draping of all surgical areas. Neck dissection left: Skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid anterior margin. Exposure of omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, superior thyroid artery. N. vagus is visualized as well as N. accessorius and N. hypoglossus. In the cranial area level II a bulging mass. This shows secretions similar to a neck cyst. No definite lymph node metastasis. Level II-V is evacuated in a typical manner and the branches of the cervical plexus are also preserved. Careful hemostasis. Exposure and preservation of the facial artery from below. The external jugular vein is separated cranially and initially ligated and preserved. Neck dissection on the right is then performed in the same way. Here level II-V evacuation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequent tracheotomy by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Small Kocher's collar incision. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Splitting of these. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, undercutting of this, clamping, severing and treatment using puncture ligatures. Subsequent visualization of the trachea. Entering the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Creation of a modified Björk flap with a wide base. This is epithelized in the typical manner. Subsequently reintubation and insertion of a size 8 tracheal tube, which is fixed with sutures. Then after measuring the defect, which is 11 x 6-7 cm. Mark the size and shape of the flap on the left forearm. Then first lift the flap subfascially from the ulnar side. Then extend the incision into the crook of the elbow. Expose the superficial venous system and connection to the deep venous system. Subfascial elevation of the superficial venous system. Subsequent elevation of the flap subfascially from the radial side. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. Subsequent exposure of the radial artery. After clamping and waiting, no change in the saturation of the hand, which is always 100% in this case. Deposition of the radial artery. Successive elevation of the radial artery flap with ligation or bipolar coagulation or clipping of vessels. The vascular pedicle is dissected up to the antecubital fossa. Good confluence can be visualized here. Connection to the superficial venous system. A large cephalic vein with ends on the superficial venous system. Finally, the flap is removed. Veins are ligated. Confluence is additionally clipped. The interosseous artery is clipped after waiting for saturation. The radial artery is treated at the entrance to the brachial artery using 6-0 Vascufil sutures. The flap is flushed with heparin and preserved. In the forearm, after extensive hemostasis, the skin is first closed proximally in the typical manner and a Redon drain is inserted. A piece of split skin is then removed from the thigh with the dermatome in the typical manner. Hydrocolloid dressing is then applied. Split skin is worked into the defect. Here complete tension-free defect coverage. Relief incisions. Application of swabs. Application of octenidine gel and Mepilex. The arm is then covered with compresses and wrapped in absorbent cotton. Application and fitting of a Cramer splint. This is fixed in a functional position with a tape bandage. Hand is in 100% saturation. Subsequent positioning of the arm. Radialis flap is successively worked into the defect with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. The pedicle is inserted anteriorly in the area of the defect. The digastric muscles were also cut from below. Other parts of the muscles of the floor of the mouth, including the submandibular gland, were also removed to enlarge the tunnel. The submandibular gland was removed because the sublingual gland and the entire wharton's duct were also resected, as was the lingual nerve. All removed parts of the floor of the mouth muscles and the submandibular gland are preserved and sent for histology as another final marginal sample. The mucosa in the right floor of the mouth area is incised and the Wharton's duct is incised and marsupialized. The flap is sutured over here in the typical manner. After the flap has been completely sutured without tension and the pedicle has been passed into the soft tissues of the neck, the facial artery is selected, as the lumen of the superior thyroid artery is too small for connection to the radial artery. The radial artery is anastomosed with the facial artery after conditioning with single 9-button Ethilon sutures. Opening of the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. The V. thyroidea media and a further outlet for the venous anastomosis are then prepared and conditioned, as are the V. cephalica and an outlet of the confluence. After conditioning, the confluence is anastomosed to the small outlet from the V. thyroidea media using a 1.5 mm coupler. After opening the clamps, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The larger outlet from the V. thyroidea media is then anastomosed with the V. cephalica using a 2.5 mm coupler. Again, good venous return after opening the vein. Positive smear phenomenon. Subsequent careful irrigation of the wound area. Careful hemostasis. Layered wound closure on the left with 2 flaps. Skin closure on the right in the neck area with insertion of a Redon drainage. Check the flap again, it is well perfused. Severe swelling in the mouth area. Patient goes to the intensive care unit postoperatively ventilated. Please continue antibiotic treatment with Unacid, which was started intraoperatively, for one week. Nutrition via the inserted PEG tube. This should be loosened the following day. Thereafter, if necessary, nutrition via the PEG tube. Food build-up after 7-10 days at the earliest, depending on the flap situation. If necessary, swallow porridge. Check the flap transorally. A suture marker is placed for Doppler control. Check the flap according to the schedule for 5 days. Heparin perfusor 500 E/h was started intraoperatively, please continue this for 5 days. Overall cT3-4 carcinoma of the floor of the tongue extending into the base of the tongue. Defect covered by radial flap. The left cervical mass in level II may be a neck cyst or a lymph node metastasis with necrotic contents. In this case, however, the macroscopic aspect is atypical.

Introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleagues and implementation of the team time-out. Induction of intubation anesthesia by colleagues. First start of PEG insertion, for this purpose pre-mirroring with the flexible gastroesophagoscope into the stomach. Locate the anterior wall of the stomach and perform a positive diaphanoscopy. The PEG tube is then inserted in the usual way using the thread pull-through method. Now carefully mirror back. Inspection of the surgical site from the endolaryngeal side with the Kleinsasser tube: This shows a tumorous mass purely endolaryngeal in the area of the left aryepiglottic fold and the left pocket fold extending onto the glottis. The posterior surface of the aryepiglottic fold and the postcricoid region as well as the piriform sinus on the right and left side and the base of the tongue are tumor-free. To be on the safe side, a sample is taken from the base of the tongue and sent for frozen section diagnostics. No tumor infiltration after feedback. The laryngectomy is then started by creating an apron flap. To do this, mark the skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid on both sides to below the cricoid, extending centrally to the cervix. Separation of the cutaneous-subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Subplatysmal flap preparation and suturing of the flap at the level of the hyoid bone. Now proceed in parallel on both sides. Neck dissection on the right side. For this, dissect along the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the deep cervical fascia. Here the accessory nerve is exposed and freed from the neck preparation. Expose the digastric muscle at the cranial border and follow the muscle to the hyoid bone. Now identify the omohyoid muscle and dissect along the muscle to the hyoid bone. The neck resectate is carefully detached from the cervical vascular nerve sheath. Now remove the neck dissectate region II to V from cranial to caudal in one piece. Subtle hemostasis using bipolar coagulation forceps and completion of the neck dissection on the right side without complications. The accessorius nerve and all other nerve and vascular structures were preserved. Now the same procedure on the left side. There were also no abnormalities during the dissection. Now freeing of the larynx after performing the tracheotomy in the 2nd to 3rd intertracheal space. Free preparation of the laryngeal skeleton from the thyroid gland. The cervical vascular nerve sheath is also freed from the laryngeal skeleton on both sides. For this purpose, the artery and the superior laryngeal nerve are ligated and clamped on both sides. Dissection of the hyoid bone with the harmonic knife. To do this, detach the suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles. The hypoglossal nerve can be exposed on both sides of the upper edge of the hyoid bone and safely protected. After resection of the hyoid bone, sharp entry into the base of the tongue just above the epiglottis. Due to the supraglottic extension, it is decided not to dissect the epiglottis sharply. Identification of the epiglottis and dislocation. It becomes apparent that the tumor has a purely endolaryngeal extension that does not extend beyond the aryepiglottic fold or the epiglottis. The tip of the epiglottis is free of tumor. Now carefully dissect along the aryepiglottic fold. For this purpose, a greater distance is used on the left side (tumor side) than on the right side (in the usual manner). Unite the incision postcricoidally and extirpate the larynx while sparing the mucosa of the hypopharynx. The piriform sinus can be easily detached from the thyroid cartilage on both sides and protected. After removal of the larynx, obtain 6 marginal samples (postcricoid, left inferior and superior hypopharynx, right inferior and superior hypopharynx, base of tongue). The tissue samples obtained are sent for frozen section diagnostic evaluation. After feedback, all marginal samples are free. Perform a myotomy of the inferior constrictor pharyngeal muscle. Insertion of a provox prosthesis in the usual manner. Then two-layer pharyngeal suture using a continuous inverted suture and placement of a T-suture. A second single button suture is placed over this to protect it. Incision of the tracheostoma, placement of two Redonda sutures and two-layer wound closure using subcutaneous/cutaneous sutures.","Laryngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, PEG placement

Grasp the tongue and resect the tumor successively with the ultrasonic knife. This results in an almost complete hemiglossectomy. In the frozen section histological examination, all tumor margins are found to be at least 0.5 cm in the healthy tissue, so that an R0 resection can be assumed. Careful hemostasis by bipolar coagulation. Re-adaptation of the wound edges with several mattress sutures. Subsequent transition to diagnostic panendoscopy. Hypopharyngoscopy reveals leukoplakic changes except for the left hypopharyngeal side wall at the entrance to the piriform sinus, which are biopsied. These are also without evidence of malignancy on frozen section histology. The larynx and all mirror findings are unremarkable. Subsequent flexible gastroesophagoscopy. No evidence of neoplasia. The esophagus is leukoplakic and vulnerable almost over its entire length, so that a gastroenterological clarification is recommended here. Finally, after obtaining the histology, a transnasal gastric tube is inserted, the position of which is checked by auscultation. Finally, infiltration of the tongue resection with Naropin. Conclusion: Transoral partial glossectomy on the right side for tongue carcinoma. R0 frozen section histology (resection margins greater than or equal to 0.5 cm). Panendoscopy revealed leukoplakic changes in the left hypopharyngeal side wall and along almost the entire length of the esophagus.

In the cranio-lateral region, one has the impression that it has not come off safely in the healthy area. A resection is performed here. Otherwise, the tumor margins are macroscopically clear on all sides, even in depth. Suture marking of the specimen after tumor resection. The specimen is sent together with the resection for final histological examination. Extensive and careful hemostasis in the area of the resection site. After completion of the resection, the oropharynx is inspected again. Dry conditions prevail here. Insertion of a feeding tube. The correct position of the feeding tube is checked using air insufflation. Neck dissection on the right: A curved scar can be seen along the right lateral side of the neck, obviously from the resection of a glomus jugulare tumor. This scar is completely reopened. Sharp transection of the subcutaneous tissue. The sternocleidomastoid muscle cannot be identified. Then, due to the scarring and the altered anatomy, laborious dissection and exposure of the internal jugular vein, the common carotid artery, the vagus nerve, the superior thyroid artery and the digastric muscle. The accessorius nerve cannot be visualized either. The internal jugular vein appears to have been occluded cranially. Multiple pathological lymph nodes can be seen along the cervical vascular sheath, but particularly in region IV and in the deep regions of region V. All pathological lymph nodes are removed while sparing the structures mentioned. A stronger venous vessel with a connection to the internal jugular vein is bypassed caudally.

Removal of the carcinoma by laser or from the outside is now indicated in view of the overall described difficulty of adjustment.,"First of all, the Kleinsasser tube C. Although the tumor is difficult to adjust, it is ultimately adjustable and thus laser resectable when pressure is applied from the outside. The tumor on the right is distended with ingrowth into the laryngeal ventricle. Macroscopically, the left mucosa is rather inconspicuous, no really visible areas of suspicious tumor. Tumor on the right extends to just in front of the arytenoid cartilage and also to just in front of the commissure, which is visible when pressure is applied from the outside. Laser resection of the tumor on the right was therefore performed. Due to the extent and volume of the tumor, it is resected including the vocal cord on the left and the anterior commissure with minor removal of the most anterior parts of the vocal fold, the supraglottic space and the subglottic space on the left. Resection extends laterally to the cartilage, taking the perichondrium with it. The vocal process is also resected dorsally. Caudally, the subglottic slope at a distance of approx. 4-5 mm from the tumor is removed and marked with sutures. A marginal sample is taken subglottically on the right, subglottically in front and supraglottically in front. The mucosa is also removed from the anterior third of the left vocal fold by stripping and also sent in as a marginal sample. In the frozen section, the tumor including the marginal samples is removed in healthy tissue. In the area of the left anterior vocal fold, there is still high-grade dysplasia, but without a visible transition to carcinoma in situ. Nevertheless, due to these findings, the mucosa is also removed in the sense of stripping from the posterior parts of the left vocal fold, including the transition to the morgue ventricle and the subglottic outlet. These mucosal parts are sent in as the final sample. Now most careful hemostasis. No more bleeding at the end of the operation. A tracheotomy can be dispensed with due to the overall situation. Removal of the mouth guard and Kleinsasser tube. Completion of the procedure without complications. Overall cT1-2 glottic carcinoma on the right and carcinoma in situ or high-grade dysplasia on the vocal fold in the mucosal area on the left. Patient received intraoperative and preoperative clindamycin antibiotics. Please continue this antibiotic treatment for one week.

In the synopsis of the findings cT3 cN2c G3 cM0. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was indicated.","After intubation and preparation by the anesthesia colleagues, first inspection and palpation of the primary tumor area. An exulcerated tumor of the left base of the tongue was found, extending into the vallecula and occupying a good half of the base of the tongue, in contact with the epiglottis, extending over the lateral pharyngeal wall in the area of the caudal pole of the tonsil up to the entrance of the piriform sinus. Palpatory clear deep infiltration in the area of the base of the tongue. Due to the deep location of the tumor, indication for a primary transcervical approach. PEG insertion should be performed first. For this purpose, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-scanning into the stomach and, with good diaphanoscopy, easy puncture of the stomach and subsequent placement of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. After positioning the patient, start with the neck dissection on the left side. Submandibular skin incision here. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue as well as the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery, the hypoglossal nerve and the facial vein. Level II shows a metastasis measuring approx. 3 cm in the area of the jugulo-facial angle, no surrounding infiltration, the accessorius nerve can be preserved. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Subsequent resection of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the external carotid arteries and long exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Release of the pharyngeal side wall against the carotid artery. Subsequent exposure of the hyoid. Entering the pharynx just below the epiglottis. Palpation reveals that the tumor is barely displaceable on the lingual surface of the epiglottis. Therefore resection of the cranial end of the epiglottis by approx. 2/3 of the width. Subtotal resection of the vallecula basally on all sides clearly in the healthy area. Subsequent resection of half of the base of the tongue. A clear safety margin is also maintained here. Resection of the pharyngeal side wall and thus macroscopic in sano removal of the tumor. Macroscopically narrowest point in the area of the pharyngeal side wall, otherwise extensive resection and clear resection distance to the depth on all sides. In the area of the pharyngeal side wall, a marginal specimen is therefore completely imaged in the pharyngeal area. The remaining marginal samples are then removed from the specimen, completely covering it. CIS with a questionable microinvasive component can still be seen in the area of the pharyngeal side wall in otherwise completely tumor- and dysplasia-free marginal samples. Therefore, a resection is performed in the entire area followed by imaging of a marginal sample, which is diagnosed as completely free of dysplasia and tumor. Therefore an overall R0 situation. Measurement of the defect. A defect measuring a total of 12 x 7 cm was found, which extended from the soft palate to the entrance of the piriform sinus, with removal of the vallecula and half of the base of the tongue. The rest of the tongue is regular and well supplied with blood. Turn to the neck dissection of the right side. In principle the same procedure as on the opposite side. Submandibular incision. After cutting through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, expose the bordering muscles. Clear the anterior neck preparation while carefully protecting the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery and the facial vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Clearing of the accessorius triangle while carefully protecting the nerve. Subsequent evacuation of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. This also revealed a clearly suspicious change measuring a good 2.5 cm in the jugulo-facial angle, confirming the overall cN2c neck status. On the opposite side, a metastasis-specific lesion was also removed in toto in the soft tissue on the way to tumor resection. This is followed by careful wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. The plastic tracheostomy is then performed. Horizontal incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. After cutting through the thyroid isthmus, enter between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring. Perform a visor tracheotomy and suture the trachea to the skin level. Subsequently, easy transfer to a size 8 low-cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. The radialis graft is then removed from the left forearm. After applying the tourniquet, mark the graft measuring 12 x 7.5 cm in total. Radial exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure and protection of the superficial radial nerve ramus. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle and transection of the vascular pedicle. Ulnar dissection of the flexor carpi ulnaris. Strictly subfascial release. Making the extension incision. The cephalic vein lies far dorsally and is therefore not elevated. Stalk preparation in the crook of the elbow. Expose and secure the outlet of the ulnar artery and the common interosseous artery. Exposure of a venous confluence. Subsequent reopening of the tourniquet. Vital graft. Regular blood supply to the hand. Careful hemostasis of the graft and the forearm and removal of the vital graft after ligation and clipping of the supplying vessels. The wound is then closed in two layers in the arm area and the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the groin is then incorporated. This is followed by treatment with a vacuum sealing bandage and application of the Kramer splint in the functional position and repositioning of the arm. To lift the full-thickness skin from the groin on the right. Incision of a piece of skin measuring approx. 14 x 6.5 cm. Strictly cutaneous lifting. Subcutaneous mobilization. Careful hemostasis. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure under moderate tension. Subsequent transcervical insertion of the graft. Overall good fit and intact conditions on all sides. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery. Perform the arterial anastomosis with 8-0 Ethilon. Immediate correct pedicle position and venous return. Measure a coupler size 3.0 and perform the venous anastomosis with the facial vein using the coupler system. Subsequently, proper graft perfusion and proper pedicle position with positive spreading phenomenon. This is followed by careful wound irrigation, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Final inspection and completion of the procedure with a vital graft.","Transorale Tumorresektion mit partieller Pharyngektomie, Neck dissection, Freier Lappen (Radialis)

There is therefore an indication for further clarification and, if necessary, tumor removal.","After an introductory consultation with the anesthesiology colleagues, the glottic plane is first adjusted by laryngoscopy. Then, using 0 degree optics, visualization up to the glottic plane. This reveals an uneven mucosal change on the left side and a smooth mucosal protrusion on the right anterior side. The subglottic slope and the trachea are completely free of irritation and unremarkable. The patient is then intubated somewhat laboriously by the surgeon. The patient is then repositioned for esophagoscopy. The mucosa is found to be free of irritation when the flexible instrument is inserted into the esophagus. The patient is then viewed through to the stomach, where a regular mucosal relief can also be seen. After aspiration of the insufflated air, careful inspection of the esophagus during reflection. Here too, the mucosal conditions are normal. The patient is then repositioned for inspection of the oral cavity and oropharynx. Here too, the conditions are normal and unremarkable. Remove the Kleinsasser tube. Then, the hypopharynx is examined, where the mucosal conditions are also normal and without irritation. Then add the support autoscopy and the surgical microscope. Difficult adjustment of the glottic plane. The findings described above can be seen here. A deep sample is now taken from the area of the anterior third of the vocal fold on the right side under intact mucosa, which is carefully split with scissors. This is sent for frozen section diagnostics. After the diagnosis of an invasive carcinoma is made, the intraoperative endoscopic site is inspected again. This shows that the tumor is moving far forward into the anterior commissure. With difficult positioning of the patient, reliable tumor control from the endolaryngeal side is not possible. The decision is therefore made to operate on the larynx from the outside. After removing all instruments, the patient is repositioned for partial laryngeal resection from the outside. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline. Then Z-shaped incision prelaryngeal. Layered preparation in depth. Separation of the prelaryngeal muscles. The muscles are then pushed away from the anterior surface of the larynx. Slitting of the perichondrium. Then opening of the thyroid cartilage with the wheel. Horizontal opening of the ligamentum conicum and opening of the larynx. This shows that the tumor is significantly larger than initially expected from the endolaryngeal side. The tumor is then detached from the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage together with the perichondrium. Further dissection in the dorsal direction. The tumor almost reaches the vocal process. The tumor is deposited here near the vocal process. ................................ Parts of the subglottic slope are also resected. The resection extends cranially into the entrance of the pyriform sinus. The pouch ligament is unaffected by the tumor and remains completely intact. In the area of the anterior commissure, however, the tumor slightly crosses the midline, so that the resection must also extend to the opposite side here. Then take frozen section samples from all marginal areas of the resection. These are sent for frozen section diagnostics. However, it should be noted that the cranial and dorsal margins of the right side as well as the lower center are not in sano. Therefore, another clear resection in the area of the upper dorsal margin. The pocket ligament remains intact. Resection of the entire ligamentum conicum, the entire horizontal on the cricoid cartilage and at the attachment to the thyroid cartilage. These resected areas are sent for final histological diagnosis. Then marginal samples are taken again for rapid diagnosis from the area of the caudal margin of the thyroid cartilage on the outside and endolaryngeally at the transition to the trachea. These are still found to be tumor-free intraoperatively. The edge specimen of the dorsal cranial margin was also found to be tumor-free in the frozen section, so that an R0 resection can now be assumed. Careful hemostasis is therefore performed. Subsequently, a burr hole is made in the area of the thyroid cartilage and the ligament is tightened anteriorly in order to possibly ensure better voice regulation. In addition, two further drill holes are made in the area of the thyroid cartilage at the top and bottom on both sides. A laryngeal wedge is then sutured into place using these drill holes. The prelaryngeal muscles are then mobilized and sutured in front of the larynx. A slightly gaping space remains due to the missing ligamentum conicum between the cricoid cartilage and thyroid cartilage. This is also closed prelaryngeally with mobilized muscles. A large wound flap is inserted here, which is then drained to the outside. A second layer of prelaryngeal muscle is sutured again. Subcutaneous suture and skin suture and application of a pressure bandage. Before closing the larynx, a marginal sample was taken from the pocket ligament on the left side. If a carcinoma in situ is also found here, these findings should be discussed in detail in the tumor conference with regard to adjuvant therapy. A follow-up MLE should be planned for the patient in 6 weeks. If necessary, Keel removal can then also be performed. Final consultation with the anesthesia colleagues.","Kehlkopfteilresektion v. außen

Now recurrence clinically and according to imaging cT3 to 4. In CT the tumor grows up to the vicinity of the hyoid bone. Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery is now indicated.","First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The exophytic tumor is visible, which grows from the lower tonsil pole via the glossoalveolar or glossotonsillar region to the base of the tongue, via the lateral wall of the oropharynx to the posterior wall of the oropharynx. Therefore, surgical indication for resection with flap coverage. First, skin disinfection and sterile draping of all surgical areas, including the right forearm and thigh. First tracheostoma placement and PEG placement by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. After problem-free orotracheal intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, first tracheostomy in the typical manner: Marking of the landmarks and the well palpable cricoid cartilage level and prior local anesthetic infiltration with Ultracaine 2% with suprarenin addition caudal to the cricoid cartilage. Skin incision according to Kocher and separation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection in layers and then exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Ligation of a small median vein beforehand. Dissection on the cricoid cartilage and from here dissection caudally on the trachea without significant thyroid tissue, thus now a good view of the anterior surface of the trachea after previous transection of the linea alba. Then opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp and insertion of a visor tracheotomy and circular tension-free mucocutaneous anastomosis. Problem-free intubation onto an LE tube. Now PEG insertion: Pre-mirroring with the flexible endoscope while inspecting the irritation-free esophageal mucosa and air insufflation in the stomach. If diaphanoscopy is excellent, insertion of the PEG using the thread pull-through method in the typical manner. Perioperative administration of 3 g Unacid. On withdrawal of the endoscope, re-inspection of the lesion-free esophageal mucosa. Subsequent repositioning for neck dissection and tumor resection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Opening of the old scar and extension slightly submentally. Extension also caudally. Subsequent neck dissection on the right: exposure of the digastric muscle, omohyoid muscle, sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, superior thyroid artery, facial artery and lingual artery. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Clearing of levels II to V, preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Subsequent removal of the right submandibular gland in preparation for tumor resection. Also removal of level I b lymph nodes. The entire dissection was considerably more difficult due to scarring, in particular the veins and also the larger vessels were distorted cranially superior to the pharyngeal wall in the sense of severe scarring. Difficult removal of the scars. A facial vein with 2 outlets and a further outlet from the internal jugular vein can be dissected from the scar tissue. Subsequently, combined transoral, transcervical tumor resection: All large vessels and nerves are ligated using Wessel loops and pulled to the side. The tumor is then resected under internal and external control. Incision of the macroscopically visible tumor at a distance of 1.5 cm on all sides. The area of the posterior palatal arch, the entire tonsil lobe, the mucosa up to the alveolar ridge, parts of the base of the tongue, the lateral wall of the oropharynx and approx. 2 thirds of the posterior wall of the oropharynx are resected. Resection up to the border of the nasopharynx. The specimen is sent to the frozen section marked with a thread. Also marginal samples from basal, which includes hyoid bone and adjacent soft tissue. Marginal specimen from the vallecula to the caudal base of the tongue and marginal specimen from the posterior palatal arch to the upper posterior wall of the oropharynx adjacent to the nasopharynx. Marginal samples are thread-marked for frozen section. The frozen section still shows infiltrates in the area of the cranial margin of the posterior palatal arch and the cranial oropharyngeal wall. Here, another resection over several millimeters and another removal of a marginal sample, which extends from the border area at the alveolar ridge over the posterior palatal arch remnant to the posterior oropharyngeal wall. This is again sent to the frozen section. Carcinoma in situ infiltrates in the medial cranial area, i.e. in the oropharyngeal area extending to the nasopharynx. Therefore, another resection and subsequent removal of a marginal sample from the cranial oropharyngeal area or now already the nasopharyngeal mucosa area. No more higher-grade dysplasia or carcinoma infiltrates here. Thus a surgical R0 situation, although field carcinomatization cannot be completely ruled out. Typical skin incision and neck dissection on the left: This is performed in the same way as on the right side. Evacuation of levels II to V and preservation of the structures and branches of the cervical plexus. Ligation in the area of the inferior lymphatic vessels. Subsequent careful irrigation and hemostasis of all surgical areas. Measurement of the defect and the three-dimensional configuration. Defect length approx. 11 cm and width 8 to 9 cm. Recording on the forearm according to the orientation. Subsequent elevation of the forearm flap: First, recutting of the ulnar and superfascial preparation. Then extend cranially to the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the superficial venous system and the connection to the deep venous system. Subsequent radial incision. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. As far as possible. Caudal exposure of the radial artery. After clamping and sufficient time with adequate saturation of the forearm, cut through. The artery is ligated with 4-0 Prolene stitches. Lift the flap along its deep pedicle, including the superficial pedicle. Outgoing vessels are clipped or bipolar coagulated. Two branches of the cephalic vein and a confluence can be visualized in the antecubital fossa. The interosseous artery is cut and clipped after clamping and good saturation. The cephalic vein, the confluence and the radial artery are then removed. The artery is closed with stitching sutures after removal. The veins are ligated. Irrigation of the flap. The flap is then inserted into the defect. Successive suturing using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Tension-free closure is achieved, even with reconstruction of the posterior palatal arch. Difficult suturing cranially in the area of the nasopharynx. Subsequent vascular anastomoses. Conditioning of the radial artery and the superior thyroid artery. The superior thyroid artery must be incised slightly, followed by anastomosis with 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. One of the cephalic veins is anastomosed with an outlet from the prepared facial vein after appropriate conditioning with a 3-0 coupler. Here, too, good venous return after opening the clamps, positive smear phenomenon. The other outlet from the facial vein is anastomosed with the 2nd outlet of the cephalic vein. Here, too, the smear phenomenon is positive after opening the clamps, good venous flow after opening the clamps. The confluence is clipped. Subsequent preparation and fixation of the pedicle in a favorable position. Irrigation of the surgical site. Hemostasis. Wound closure in layers on the right and insertion of 2 flaps on the left with insertion of a Redon drain. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma is completed. Insertion of an 8 mm tracheostomy tube, which is fixed with sutures. Thoracic inspection shows flap well perfused. The forearm is primarily closed cranially, the defect is closed caudally using split skin taken laterally from the right thigh with a thickness of 0.8 mm. Here, after taking swabs and relief incisions, Mepilex is taken and loose compresses are applied and fixed with absorbent cotton. A Kramer splint is then fitted and secured with an elastic bandage. Positioning of the arm. Saturation of the hand is always above 95 to 100 %. Starch is applied to the thigh area and then Mepilex. The procedure is completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit ventilated. Please continue antibiotics, which were started intraoperatively with Unacid, for approx. 1 week. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube, which should be loosened after 24 hours, for approx. 10 days, followed by gruel swallowing and, if necessary, diet build-up. Check blood flow to the flap clinically or by Doppler. Overall cT4a oropharyngeal carcinoma recurrence.

The pharyngoscopy/laryngoscopy reveals a tumor that completely occupies the endolarynx, but also has a clear, partially submucosal component that has already reached the mucosa in the area of the postcricoid and also in the area of the median wall of the right piriform sinus and slightly also of the left piriform sinus. The PEG system is now placed first, so flexible esophagogastroscopy is performed, followed by diaphanoscopy and placement of the PEG tube in the typical manner using the suture retraction method. Now proceed to the laryngectomy: an apron flap is formed for this, which goes into the old tracheostoma, where the severely inflamed skin is now partially resected. Now form the apron flap subplatysmal. Then turn to the neck dissection of the right side: Here several, clearly enlarged lymph nodes are visible, which are partially cemented together with the jugularis. The sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the digastric muscle are thus exposed, then the accessor nerve is exposed and spared. The next step is to dissect along the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial. Here, resection of the metastases directly cranial to the omohyoid muscle is quite difficult because the latter are connected to the jugular vein. The resection is ultimately successful. After complete exposure of the internal jugular vein, the lateral neck preparation is formed while sparing the vagus nerve, carotid artery, accessorius nerve and plexus branches. Several enlarged lymph nodes are also found here. Now follow the digaster anteriorly. Expose the submandibular gland. Tracing of the omohyoid gland and formation of the medial neck preparation while sparing the hypoglossal nerve and facial vein; the superior thyroid artery is also exposed and spared. Now proceed to the neck dissection on the left side: identical procedure here with only slightly enlarged lymph nodes. Expose the digastric, omohyoid and sternocleidomastoid muscles. Sparing of the accessorius nerve and formation of the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial. Then dissect the lateral neck preparation while sparing the accessorius nerve and the plexus branches. Now turn to the medial neck preparation. Expose the facial vein and the hypoglossal nerve, which are spared, and follow the digastric muscle anteriorly. Expose and spare the submandibular gland. Then remove the medial neck preparation. Now the laryngectomy is performed: First separate the 2 halves of the thyroid gland from the trachea and then remove the omohyoid muscle and the cervical vascular sheath from the swallowing duct. The superior laryngeal nerve and its bundle are severed and ligated on both sides. The hyoid bone is now skeletonized in the cranial region and then the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle is detached from the lateral thyroid cartilage and dissected on the left side of the piriform sinus. Detachment of the latter from the inside of the larynx. On the right side, this step is omitted if a tumor is present. Now prepare the cranial side of the hyoid bone. To do this, place the left side transorally in the vallecula region and continue submucosal dissection along the lingual side of the epiglottis. Due to the suspicion that the tumor is very close, it is decided to open the pharynx in the vallecula after all. This is also carried out and it quickly becomes apparent that the laryngeal side of the epiglottis is also clearly affected by the tumor and that the distance to the healthy mucosa is therefore relatively small. Now first imaging of the left side. Here along the aryepiglottic fold, but then deviate to the lateral piriform sinus wall because there is also tumor infestation here. On the right side, proceed in the same way along the lateral side of the piriform sinus because the median side is affected by small tumor islands. In the postcricoid area, the pharyngeal suture can be reunited approximately 2 cm below the arytenoid cartilage region. Further submucosal dissection caudally until the cricoid cartilage is reached. Now change and attach the tracheal rings to the newly cut skin and then place the laryngeal preparation directly caudal to the cricoid cartilage. Due to the very extensive tumor, it is now decided not to send the entire preparation for frozen section examination, but to take additional frozen sections. For this purpose, the tracheal posterior wall and the base of the tongue are resected on the right side and then several frozen sections are taken from the trachea, the postcricoid region, the base of the tongue and the piriform sinus on both sides. All frozen sections are later found to be tumor-free. The cricopharyngeal muscle is then myotomized and a size 8 Provox prosthesis is placed in the typical manner using the retraction method. This is followed by pharyngeal suturing, which initially involves inverted sutures, then a 2nd layer of the submucosal layer and finally a 3rd layer of the muscle layer with the constrictor pharyngis inferior muscle. For additional reduction of a pharyngeal fistula, 2 TachoSil swabs are placed, 1x caudally and 1x in the area of the base of the tongue, more precisely in the area of the T-suture. Finally, the apron flap is retracted and attached to the tracheostoma, 2 Redon drains are placed and the wound is closed in two layers using subcutaneous and skin sutures. The patient goes to the IOI ward after waking up due to lack of capacity. Intraoperative administration of Unacid 3 g, which should be continued for 5 days. In addition, a nasogastric tube is inserted to serve as a splint.","Komplette Laryngektomie, Neck dissection Level Ib - V, PEG-Anlage, Provox

Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery is now indicated.","Moving the patient to the operating theater. Actively carrying out the team time-out. Active patient identification. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Induction of intubation anesthesia by colleagues. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon. First, laryngoscopy and pharyngoscopy again: After insertion of the small bore tube, the exophytic tumor, which begins in the area of the piriform sinus lateral wall at the transition to the anterior wall and infiltrates the medial wall including the arytenoid area and postcricoid area, is broad-based. Therefore indication for the above mentioned surgery confirmed. Repositioning of the patient by the surgeon. Injection of 20 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into the region of the planned apron incision. Start the operation by drawing the apron flap on both sides of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to just below the cricoid medially. Separation of the cutaneous-subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Subplatysmal dissection up to the exposure of both submandibular glandulae. Suture the apron flap and expose the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides. Start with neck dissection, initially on the right side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Expose the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection down to the deep plexus branches. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and free preparation of the nerve. Particular care is taken to protect the nerve. Exposure of the posterior venter of the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and division of the specimen into a lateral and a medial specimen. Identification of the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Sharp separation of the neck dissection from the cervical vascular nerve sheath. Release of regions II, III, IV and V in one cord. Renewed wound control. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation forceps. Approach the medial part of regions II and III by exposing the facial vein and the submandibular gland. A larger lymph node metastasis in the jugulofacial angle is removed here. Irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer and bipolar coagulation of minor bleeding. Turning to the left side. Same procedure through <CLINICIAN_NAME> on the left side. No primary suspicious lymph nodes are conspicuous. On the left side, also visualize all levels while sparing the vascular and nervous structures. Then proceed to laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy on the right. Skeletonization of the pharynx and laryngeal area is performed on both sides, on the right, taking into account the carcinoma in the hypopharyngeal area. First expose the hyoid bone on both sides and separate it from the suprahyoid musculature. Dissection up to the pharyngeal tube, including the pre-epiglottic fatty tissue. Exposure of the superior cornu. Isolation of the laryngeal skeleton with separation of the constrictor pharyngis superior, first on the left, then on the right, taking into account the hypopharyngeal carcinoma. The thyroid lobe is isolated and dissected caudolaterally. The isthmus is transected and treated with puncture ligatures. Trachea is opened and epithelialized caudally using several sutures. Re-intubation and insertion of a laryngectomy tube. The larynx is then opened. The larynx is developed under visualization. On the left under maximum tension of the pharyngeal wall, on the right parts of the pharyngeal wall must also be resected. The tumor is removed at a distance of 1-1.5 cm on all sides. The tumor extends to the postcricoid, especially on the right. The pharyngeal wall can be dissected caudally. The larynx is then deposited on the trachea. The tumor specimen is marked with sutures. Due to the postcricoid growth, a mucosal margin sample is taken from the right pharyngeal wall via the postcricoid region to the border with the left pharyngeal wall. This is thread-marked and sent as a frozen section for histology. Soft tissue is also removed between the trachea and pharyngeal wall or esophageal entrance and also sent for frozen section. In the frozen section between the right pharyngeal wall and caudal still isolated tumor. Soft tissue and mucosa postcricoid free. Therefore, another extensive resection in the area of the lateral pharyngeal wall and removal of another marginal sample, which extends from the right pharyngeal wall to the postcricoid. No more tumor infiltrates in the frozen section. Thus R0 situation. A gastric tube is now inserted to splint the pharyngeal suture. Subsequent left lateral myotomy. The musculature is transected over approx. 2 - 3 cm. Then insertion of an 8 mm Provox prosthesis in the typical manner. This is placed approx. 0.5 cm lower due to the soft tissue margin between the trachea and the esophageal tube. Careful hemostasis and irrigation with Ringer's solution or hydrogen. Wound closure of the pharyngeal tube in layers with the first inverting suture. Then second inverting suture on top. Finally, third suture of the pharyngeal muscles. Sutures each with 3.0 Vicryl. Subsequent suturing of the infrahyoid musculature, which was previously dissected from the hyoid bone and folded caudal-laterally. This is also done with 3.0 Vicryl single button sutures. Lymph nodes in the level VI area were previously removed with the laryngeal preparation. Then again irrigation and careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers on both sides of the neck with insertion of a Redon drain in each case. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Finally, insertion of a 9 mm tracheostomy tube. The procedure was completed without complications. Overall cT4a cN2c laryngeal carcinoma. Patient transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Please feed via the PEG tube already inserted beforehand. This for 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Please continue antibiotics with Unacid for one week.

After intubation through the anesthesia, pharyngoscopy and confirmation of an oropharyngeal carcinoma measuring at least cT2 on the left side, which just reaches the posterior wall of the oropharynx and extends caudally and medially into the base of the tongue. On palpation, the tumor is slightly larger in comparison with the computer tomography and is difficult to move laterally. Initially under strict diaphanoscopic control and after administration of 3 g Unacid, after skin disinfection and abjodation, placement of a 15 Charričre PEG tube using the thread pull-through technique. Strict diaphanoscopic conditions on all sides. The gastric mucosa is unremarkable. Sterile dressing. Then insertion of the tonsil plug. Inspection of the tumor tissue again. Then, using the electric needle of the bipolar forceps under visualization, start resection of the tumour from cranial to caudal, taking parts of the base of the tongue with it. The tumor is not visible at any time and is released at a wide macroscopic distance. However, it becomes apparent that the tumor has grown laterally into the pterygoid musculature and the palpatory distance of the lateral tumor border lies in depth up to the immediate vicinity of the carotid flow area. It was therefore decided to continue the tumor resection transcervically; 2 cranial margin samples were tumor-free. Skin disinfection and infiltration anesthesia with a total of 18 ml Ultracaine with added adrenaline on both cervical and median sides. Start with neck dissection on the left side: skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Dissection of a subplatysmal portion of connective tissue. Release of the connective tissue sheath ventrally. Identification of the internal jugular vein, the omohyoid muscle and the digastric muscle. Remove the entire soft tissue mantle from the medial neck preparation, identify the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Now release from caudal to cranial. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, the vagus nerve and the cervical nerve. Level III and II show large, conglomerate-like lymph node metastases through which the accessorius nerve runs. It was therefore decided to resect the nerve. The internal jugular vein, which also runs through the metastasis, is then removed together with the metastatic conglomerate. The external jugular vein is preserved. After releasing and removing the submandibular gland, access is gained through level I b into the oropharynx. The en bloc resection of the tumor is now completed. Basally in the wound area to the lateral side, the pathology still describes an R1 situation, which is why selective resection is performed again at this point; the other marginal samples were tumor-free. Dissection of the external and internal carotid artery. Ligation of the left lingual artery. Identification of the vascular nerve bundle of the superior pharyngeal artery. Subtle hemostasis and neck dissection on the right side: Here too, 2 to 3 oval lymph nodes are visible in levels II and III, but overall they are also to be classified as suspicious. Neck dissection levels I b, II, III and IV and partial V are now performed. The submandibular gland is preserved, as are the external jugular vein, vagus nerve, cervical nerve, accessorius and hypoglossus. The internal jugular vein is also preserved on this side; the submandibular gland, removal of 2 inconspicuous lymph nodes from level I b. After a door-like incision, cut the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue to create a plastic tracheotomy. Blunt separation of the infrahyoid musculature. Identification of the anterior tracheal surface after transection of the isthmus of the thyroid gland. Visualization of the anterior surface of the trachea caudally. Incision between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp area. Formation of a Björk flap. Re-intubation. After ethibond suture fixation at 6 points on a 9 mm Rügheimer cannula and problem-free ventilation. Suture fixation of the cannula edges with an Ethibond suture. Then removal of an area of inguinal skin measuring 12 x 6 cm and placement of a Redon drain. At the same time, the radial flap on the left side of the forearm is removed. After placing the tourniquet, the oropharyngeal defect region is marked. This is now adapted to the forearm. Skin incision, cut in an S-shape, from the crook of the elbow into the flap area. Starting radially, detachment of the myofascial tissue portion, release of the flap with identification of the antebrachial cutaneous nerve and the parallel vein. Identification of the radial artery-venous bundle and consecutive release from distal to proximal with multiple clip ligation and bipolar coagulation of the draining and feeding branches. It is thus possible to develop a wide stalk which, however, consists of 2 small caliber veins. Removal of the tourniquet and further hemostasis and preparation of the left cervical vascular area. Removal of the pedicle and primary closure of the defect with the inguinally removed full-thickness skin and application of a VAC dressing. Please leave this in place for 7 days. Suture removal on the 7th day. Please take photo documentation, several times intraoperatively. Then also dissect the stalk of the arterio-venous vascular bundle. Now primary suture of the artery or connection to the superior thyroid artery using 8.0 Ethilon. After dissection, the external jugular vein is first recruited and supplied with a 2.0 mm coupler. The second vein is supplied with a 1.0 coupler from a venous vessel in the area of the superior or middle thyroid vein. Overall, this is very difficult to achieve, but a dense vascular anastomosis is created in both the arterial and venous areas. After placement of a Redon drain on both cervical sides, the wound is closed in two layers and a dressing is applied. Discrete signs of congestion enorally at the end of the operation but good perfusion. Cannula change on day 3 to 5; suture removal on the neck on day 7.

After exclusion of distant metastasis, indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the hypopharynx. An exophytic process measuring approx. 2-3 cm can be seen at the entrance to the piriform sinus on the medial and anterior side. The tip of the piriform sinus is free. This shows the exophytic mass measuring approx. 2-3 cm. It is located on the anterior and medial side wall of the piriform sinus. The tip is free. The lateral wall is also free. The process also extends into the postcricoid region. Adjustment of the process with the spread laryngoscope and activation of the laser and microscope. Start cutting around the tumor on the medial side wall and gradually remove it. Hemostasis is achieved using monopolar coagulation or vascular clips. To be on the safe side, another resection is performed on the medial wall, as the margin was relatively narrow after removal of the tumor in toto. Both are suture-marked for the frozen section. The frozen section still shows an invasive carcinoma in the mediocaudal area. A generous resection is performed here, including a margin sample, which is again sent to the frozen section. Final R0 situation. This results in a large wound area. Therefore decision to perform a tracheostomy. PEG placement using the thread pull-through method. Successful with good diaphanoscopy. Neck dissection on the right in the meantime. Externally a 5-6 cm metastasis breaking through the skin at level Va to b. Skin incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and in the area of the metastasis around the mass. Exposure of the platysma in the anterior upper area. Formation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This also shows that the metastasis under the skin also infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the cranial region. For this reason, the sternocleidomastoid is deposited in the caudal region at the base and the metastasis is deposited from caudal to cranial, sparing the cervical vascular sheath. The metastasis also infiltrates the cervical plexus, which must be completely removed except for a few small branches. The vagus nerve remains intact as it can be pushed away by the tumor. The border cord cannot be completely spared from the tumor. The accessory nerve is also removed. Ultimately, the hypoglossus remains at the top. During dissection, the subclavian vein is torn in the caudal area. This resulted in severe bleeding, which could be sutured over. The result is an hourglass-shaped structure that leads to narrowing of the vein but is still pervious. During the treatment of the subclavian hemorrhage, the outlet of the internal jugular vein was also torn, which ultimately had to be removed. However, deeper accompanying veins could be preserved. V. Bezas: Neck dissection on the left: Skin disinfection on the left and injection of 6 ml mixed solution of Ultracaine with 2% Suprarenin added in the area of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sterile washing and draping. Creation of a skin incision on the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth and identification of the platysma. This is cut sharply. Now lift off a subplatysmal flap anteriorly and posteriorly. Further dissection in depth and identification of the superficial cervical fascia. Now identify the external jugular vein and auricular nerve. The great auricular nerve is completely spared and the external jugular vein is coagulated and cut. Now identify the sternocleidomastoid and dissect in depth along the muscles. First dissection in the level II b area until the digastric muscle is identified. Now dissect further along the digastric muscle until the accessor nerve is identified. Tissue above the accessorius nerve is sharply separated and the remaining tissue from level II b is pulled under the accessorius. Further dissection in the area of level II a up to the identification of the facial vein. Here a resection is performed below the submandibular gland. The marginal ramus nerve and facial nerve are not exposed during the preparation. Now clear Level II a until the hypoglossal nerve is identified. The hypoglossal nerve and internal carotid artery are exposed and spared. Now dissect further downwards along the sternocleidomastoid muscle to below the omohyoid muscle. Dissection further laterally up to the identification of the cervical plexus. Further dissection anteriorly above the cervical plexus and prevertebral cervical fascia. Sharp separation of the fatty tissue in level IV and dissection now along the common carotid artery. The fascia of the cervical vascular sheath is largely spared here. Now lift the preparation cranially and complete the dissection in level IV and level III above the internal jugular vein. Further dissection along the omohyoid muscle and infrahyoid muscles. The complete neck dissection is removed as one piece and sent for histological analysis. Careful hemostasis using ligatures and bipolar forceps. A size 10 Redon drain is placed and the wound is closed step by step once the bleeding has stopped completely. <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Lifting of the pectoralis major flap. Measurement of the defect. This results in a 5x7 cm defect that needs to be covered on the neck. The skin island medial to the nipple is configured accordingly. Creation of a skin bridge in the area of the theoretical delto-pectoral flap. Lifting of the skin island from the thoracic wall while protecting the pectoralis minor muscle. Locate and expose the vascular pedicle. Medial separation of the pectoralis major and lateral separation of the pectoralis major from the attachment to the humerus. Finally, most of the muscle is removed. The pedicle is palpable the entire time and the skin island is well supplied with blood. Pull the flap through the skin bridge and fit the graft so that a large muscle patch is positioned in the area of the pharynx. This muscle patch is fixed with sutures and the skin island can be inserted into the skin defect and sutured there. Two Redon drains were previously inserted in the chest area and one in the neck area. Two-layer wound closure in the neck and chest area. At the end, a tracheotomy was created using the visor technique. Insertion into the trachea between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage and creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please set up a diet on the 7th postoperative day without performing an X-ray pre-swallow.

Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Carrying out the team time-out. Sterile ablation and draping. Start of enoral tumor resection: insertion of a McIvor spatula. There is an ulcerous-appearing mass on the anterior palatal arch on the left side with a diameter of approx. 2.5 cm. Boundaries can be defined directly. The central ulcer is approx. 1 cm in diameter and hard on palpation. The tumor is carefully and successively removed with the ultrasonic knife under palpatory and inspector control. Both the uvula and the posterior palatal arch can be preserved. The tonsil lobe with the lower part of the tonsil is also preserved. The tumor is placed in the muscles of the palatal arch in such a way that sufficient closure is still possible and regurgitation should be avoided. Marking of the specimen after successive hemostasis. The specimen goes to the frozen section. This is R0-resected on the specimen. The penetration depth of the tumor is 3 mm. Laterally, the tumor is resected over 1 cm, basally 3 mm. As a further resection in depth would result in a large defect with subsequent flap coverage and the patient has a history of internal diseases, it is decided to leave the distance of 3 mm in depth for R0 resection. Repositioning and performing the neck dissection on the left side: skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Splitting of the platysma and exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection along the omohyoid muscle and finding the submandibular gland. Pulling up the submandibular glanula and exposing the posterior digastric venter. Trace it in the direction of level II b. Several metastasis-related masses can be seen here, including an approx. 4 cm mass above the accessorius nerve. This can be carefully pushed away from the accessorius nerve as well as from the internal jugular vein and the facial vein. The accessory nerve and the hypoglossal nerve can be spared. Further free preparation of the internal jugular vein and successive removal of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the brachial plexus. Successive removal of the medial neck preparation. The cervical nerve and hypoglossal nerve are exposed and preserved. The vagus nerve is also identified and can be preserved. A metastasis is palpated above the submandibular gland at level I b. This was also visualized sonographically. For this reason, successive removal of the submandibular gland on the left side. Ligation of the excretory duct. The lingual nerve with its loop was identified and spared. Successive removal of level I b. For this purpose, the marginal ramus of the facial nerve above the facial vein is first exposed and followed. A total of 6 small branches can be exposed. Ligation and removal of the facial vein and folding it upwards. Successive removal of region I a and I b so that the mandible is subsequently exposed and can be seen. Also removal of level I a. Successive hemostasis. Insertion of a Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Neck dissection on the right: The incision is made in a curved line at the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Use the 15 mm scalpel to sharply cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Dissection of the subplatysmal flap. Dissection of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland, the accessorius nerve and the posterior belly of the digaster. Now the anterior neck preparation is also removed at the jugulofacial angle and medial to the cervical vascular sheath. The hypoglossal nerve is exposed and spared as well as the external and internal carotid arteries. The lateral preparation is now resected, starting with level II b to V b on the right side. There is an anastomosis between the accessorius nerve and the deep cervical plexus on the right side. No chyle fistula, no injury to the surrounding structures. Dissection of the internal jugular vein leads to a small tear in the vein, which is treated with 6-0 Vascufil. The submandibular gland to the right of the gland is then dissected out after the facial vein has been cut, ligated and folded up in order to protect the oral branch of the facial nerve. The gland is dissected and the mylohyoid muscle is exposed. Exposure of the lingual nerve. The duct is severed and ligated. Also the facial artery. Removal of the gland and complete evacuation of levels I b and I a. Punctual hemostasis. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure using 4-0 Vicryl and 5-0 Ethilon.","enorale TU-Resektion, Neck diss bds., Submandibulektomie

Overall difficult visualization of the tumor borders. CT showed hypopharyngeal carcinoma with extensive destruction of the larynx on the left side and also cN3 metastasis with a long wall around the ACC without definite signs of infiltration. A preoperative occlusion test showed a regular and sufficient collateral circulation. After extensive internal clarification and therapy optimization in the multimorbid patient as well as after detailed explanatory discussions with reduced therapy options, the decision was made to perform primary radical surgery.","Initially after induction and preparation by the anesthesia colleagues. Performing a pharyngo-laryngoscopy to determine the extent of the tumor again. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube under dental protection. This reveals pronounced edema of the left aryepiglottic fold with marked edema of the left arytenoid. The endolarynx is barely adjustable. There is an exophytic, exulcerated tumor in the area of the left piriform sinus with pronounced induration and palpatory high-grade v.a. continuous growth into the soft tissues of the neck, which corresponds to the CT imaging. The free entrance to the esophagus and the piriform sinus on the right side are tumor-free, as is the posterior pharyngeal wall. The exophytic area just does not reach this. Therefore, repositioning for resection from the outside. First elevation of an apron flap incision to just above the tracheostoma. Here, with the tracheostoma clearly torn out preoperatively and a very short neck, the incision is made just above the tracheostoma. Cranial preparation of the apron flap and suture fixation. Start with neck dissection of the left side. Palpation reveals an extensive, extremely hard and barely mobile neck metastasis. Initially caudal and cranial exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. First visualization, later removal of the external jugular vein and the auricularis magnus nerve in case of safe infiltration by the metastasis Removal of the sternocleidomastoid muscle cranially and caudally. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle is not possible with complete infiltration. Visualization of the submandibular gland. Infiltration can also be seen later on. The same applies to the digastric muscle. This is visualized posteriorly and anteriorly and severed. First release of the mass, which extends caudally to level Vb. Careful release and preservation of the brachial plexus, which is not infiltrated. Release and preserve the cervical transverse artery and vein. Strict control of lymphatic leakage. Protection of the subclavian vein. Partial resection of the cervical plexus in case of infiltration, accessorius nerve can no longer be visualized in case of infiltration. Partial thyroidectomy in case of questionable infiltration of the upper pole, here clear adherence of the tumor. In the case of extensive destruction of the larynx and suspected continuous growth, no further visualization of the laryngeal skeleton. Cranial exposure of the tumor with resection of the submandibular gland and description of the digastric muscle. Caudal exposure of the long infiltrated internal jugular vein, which is placed caudally. Difficult visualization of the arteria carotis communis and the vagus nerve, which are displaced very far caudally and to the depth. These are initially free caudally. Exposure of the prevertebral fascia; a free layer can be exposed here. Now successively expose the largely walled-in common carotid artery, initially walled in far to the cranial in the area of the internal carotid artery, the vagus nerve must be removed if infiltration is safe. Consultation and demonstration of findings at <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The metastasis is now opened selectively to better expose the internal carotid artery. The internal carotid artery can be preserved by dissecting all vascular layers. No reliable evidence of infiltration. The external carotid artery is completely walled in close to the outlet without the possibility of free dissection, therefore the artery is removed after puncture and ligation. Resection of the hypoglossal nerve, careful dissection of a metastatic cone in the direction of the base of the skull in the case of long infiltration, extremely difficult dissection conditions and clear adherence. The extension ends here in a rough tissue alteration. A representative marginal sample is taken here later. Finally, the metastasis can be removed from the neck area. Only the prevertebral fascia, parts of the paravertebral musculature and the common carotid artery with the internal carotid artery and remnants of the cervical plexus remain. Now free preparation of the larynx on the right side, exposure of the hyoid, which is also infiltrated on the left side. Release of the piriform sinus, entering the vallecula above the hyoid. Looping of the epiglottis. After opening the pharynx wide in the pharyngotomy along the aryepiglottic fold on the right, successive gaining of an overview of the tumorous process. Significant aryoedema. Therefore postcricoid removal of approx. 1 cm of postcricoid mucosa. Resection of the tumor with a safety margin of approx. 1-1.5 cm. Release of the cricoid cartilage. Mobilization up to the trachea after previously performed right-sided thyroidectomy. Exposure of the free esophageal entrance and resection of the tumor in toto with the attached cervical metastasis, after removal below the cricoid cartilage while taking the first tracheal clasp subglottically, certainly no tumor growth, but with previous tracheotomy removal of a marginal sample in the area of the posterior tracheal wall in scarred conditions. In addition, completely covering mucosal margin samples. The frozen section diagnosis now shows a positive marginal sample in the area of the posterior tracheal wall and residual infiltrates in the area of the skull base with tumor-free marginal samples in the area of the primaries. Therefore, obtaining a post-resectate in the area of the skull base. Extensive release of any soft tissue area of the skull base while sparing the internal carotid artery. This is removed as a post-resectate for definitive histology. Final marginal sample in the area of soft tissue remnants, these are diagnosed as tumor-free in the frozen section, also in the area of the posterior wall of the trachea Removal of the posterior wall of the trachea and the surrounding soft tissue. A resection is also made here. A representative final marginal sample is then taken, which is also diagnosed as tumor-free. Due to the now clearly resected posterior tracheal wall, it is not necessary to insert a provox prosthesis at this point. Now to the neck dissection of the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and the auricularis magnus nerve. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. This has already been dissected from the laryngeal skeleton. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digasatric muscle. Exposure of a very strong facial venous branch, which appears to flow into the jugularis anterior current area; this is ligated and deposited in the transverse course. Exposure and dissection of the internal jugular vein. Release of the anterior neck preparation with partial ligation of the superior thyroid artery. Preservation of the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle. In the area of the cranial muscle part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, a coarse, macroscopically altered area can be seen here, partly scarred, but partly also appearing tumorously altered. Likewise in the area of the middle of the muscle, also scarred, dd tumorous area. Therefore resection of both areas. Subsequent complete excision of the accessorius triangle and level V, sparing the cervical plexus branches. Finally, wound inspection and, if the wound is dry, evaluation of the pharyngeal defect. An intact, strong residual pharyngeal tube is found, but with a clear tendency towards stenosis, particularly cranially, and in the case of primary occlusion, the common carotid artery or internal carotid artery is also unprotected over a long distance. Therefore, after initial preparation for ALT removal on the left, demonstration of findings and case discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Due to the co-mobility with known vascular disease, treatment using a pedicled pectoralis major graft is preferred to defect coverage using a microvascular graft. A defect of approx. 8 x 7 cm is measured in the area of the pharynx. If secondary reconstruction is required, a temporary deltopectoral flap is lifted first. Signs of the pectoralis major graft. Elevation of the deltopectoral flap up to the second angiosome. Separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the deltoid muscle. Strictly subfascial dissection. Protection of the Mohrenheim fossa and the cephalic vein. After medial preparation and moistening of the transient graft, resection of the pectoralis major graft. After cutting around the skin island, lift a broad muscle head laterally to cover the soft tissue in the area of the carotid artery. Release of the pectoralis muscle, strictly suprafascial preparation, exposure of the pectoralis minor. Cranial dissection with careful protection of the vascular pedicle after reliable identification of the latter. Leave a muscle cup to protect the vascular pedicle. Dissection of the vascular pedicle up to the Mohrenheim fossa, then complete resection of the attached pectoralis major muscle. The skin island can then be inserted into the pharyngeal defect completely tension-free. After insertion, a very wide skin tunnel without any tendency to tension can be seen. Therefore tunneling through the flap pedicle. Suture the skin island into the pharyngeal defect with 3.0 mucosal sutures. This works well and fits perfectly. Then cover the internal carotid artery with the attached muscle graft. This allows the artery to be covered with muscle along its entire length. After inspection of all wound cavities, two 10-gauge Redon drainage tubes are inserted pectorally and one 10-gauge Redon drainage tube is inserted on the left side; drainage on the right side must be omitted in the event of repeated loss of suction due to the tracheostoma arrangement. Subsequent careful two-layer wound closure. The tracheostoma should be sutured beforehand. Adaptation of the anterior skin. Due to the tension already present here, a tracheostoma resection is not performed anteriorly. Healthy granulation tissue on all sides and already existing wound healing disorder, therefore no further measures here. The tracheostoma ends caudally over the apron flap. The procedure is then completed without any indication of complications. The patient received intraoperative antibiotics with Unacid 3 g. Conclusion: cT4a hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the left with extremely aggressive and per continuitatem growing neck metastasis on the left, in this case an extended, radical neck dissection was performed, taking all neck structures with it except for the common carotid artery. Intraoperatively, the situation was clearly R0 with regard to the primary tumor. Due to the aggressive metastasis, exhaustion of adjuvant therapy options is certainly necessary. Postoperatively, due to the neck situation on the left, rapid indication for surgery if a fistula is detected, otherwise it is recommended to carry out an X-ray pelvis on the 10th postoperative day. After completion of wound healing, a secondary Provox treatment appears conceivable in the interval.","Teilpharyngektomie mit Laryngektomie, Neck dissection

Panendoscopy revealed an exophytic mass at the glossotonsillar groove with transition to the soft palate. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.,"Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the tumor. The tumor is located at the base of the tongue on the left side, passes over the glossotonsillar groove into the anterior palate and partly into the soft palate. Then insertion of the spandex and looping of the tongue. Now cut around the tumor with a safety distance of 1.5 to 2 cm using the monopolar needle. Further dissection with scissors, forceps and bipolar coagulation. Tumor resection is very difficult in the posterior sections of the base of the tongue due to a lack of visibility. Finally, the specimen is retrieved in its entirety. A suture mark is placed while still in situ. The specimen is then removed and inspected. There is a safety margin of approx. 1 cm in the entire preparation area. The specimen is placed on cork and sent for frozen section. In the frozen section, all margins are free of carcinoma, including no dysplasia or carcinoma in situ. There are large, palpable neck metastases on the left side, the border to the neck area can no longer be safely spared, therefore a neck dissection on the left side is dispensed with. The patient was not previously informed and prepared for a flap operation. Therefore, the neck dissection is now performed on the right side. Skin spray disinfection in the usual manner. Injection of 10 ml Ultracaine 2% with added Suprarenin in the area of the skin incision on the right. The skin incision corresponds to a curved line on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid, starting below the mastoid to two transverse fingers above the clavicle, at least two transverse fingers on all sides away from the mandibular branch and the angle of the jaw. Then reposition the patient and wash and drape sterilely in the usual manner. Skin incision and sharp separation of the platysma and dissection along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Exposure of the posterior abdomen of the digaster muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Dissection along the cervical vascular sheath from caudal to cranial. Successive removal of the posterior and anterior neck specimen while protecting the accessorius, the cervical plexus and the hypoglossal nerve, which was exposed and spared. Overall, levels I b, II, III, IV and V were completely removed. The submandibular gland was left intact. Wound irrigation with hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Dry conditions. Placement of a 10 Redon drain and platysma suture with 3.0 Vicryl and skin suture with 5.0 Ethilon. Due to the large tumor defect, indication for protective tracheostomy, also because no neck dissection could be performed on the corresponding side and the neck is difficult to access in the event of bleeding due to the metastases. Tracheotomy: After careful palpation of the cricoid, skin incision approx. 3 cm above the 2nd tracheal cartilage. Dissect with a scalpel and scissors up to the infrahyal muscles and push the muscles aside. Further dissection up to the thyroid gland, undermining of the thyroid gland, coagulation of the thyroid gland and transection. Now blunt exposure of the trachea with the swab and visor flap incision between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Sutures to the skin, 4 cranial and 4 caudal to the tracheostoma. Now hemostasis by means of focal bipolarization. No bleeding at the end of the operation. Conclusion: cT2 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma. Please repeat neck dissection of the left side on two occasions in approx. 3 weeks. Then presentation at the tumor conference with complete TNM classification. Postoperatively, if possible, inclusion of the patient in the <STUDY_NAME> study (mention at the tumor conference).","Tumorresektion li., Neck diss. rechts, Tracheotomie

Initial PEG insertion: insertion of the esophagoscope into the stomach. Once the diaphanoscopy has been performed, a 15 mm stomach wall tube is inserted without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Subsequent transoral laser resection: entering with the spreading laryngoscope. Positioning of the tumor, which is cut around on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1 cm using a 5-pulse CO2 laser. Tumor is resected in toto and is thread-marked for frozen section histology: In the frozen section just towards the base, but in healthy tissue. Carcinoma infiltrates in the cranial area or cranially in the arytenoid fold area. These are subepithelial. Therefore, the cranial area including the vallecula of the lateral epiglottis is resected again. ............................................ here from the cranially adjacent tongue base area to the vallecula. The cranial arytenoid fold was also resected during the resection. Here is another marginal sample supraglottic on the left.

Therefore, repositioning for neck dissection. First neck dissection on the left: After injecting a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1 % with adrenaline into both sides of the neck, incision on the left in the typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the digastric muscle. This must be laboriously dissected from a lymph node conglomerate and is partially resected in the process. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Visceral development of the lymph node conglomerate in level II. This can be dissected off in toto. The inferior parotid pole can also be removed. Subsequent clearing of level II-V as a whole. Exposure of the internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, superior thyroid artery, internal jugular vein, facial vein. Visualization of vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. All structures are visualized and preserved. Clearing of the level, also exposing the branches of the cervical plexus. Neck dissection on the right: skin incision in the same way. Evacuation of level II-V in the same way as on the opposite side, but here no suspicious lymph nodes. Exposure and preservation of the structures as on the opposite side. Subsequent careful irrigation of both sides of the neck. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain into each side of the neck. Then tracheostoma creation: Small Kocher collar incision, exposure of the thyroid isthmus after splitting the infrahyoid muscles. This is clamped off, severed and supplied by means of puncture ligatures. Presentation of the trachea. Creation of a Björk flap in the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Epithelialization in a typical manner. Insertion of a laryngectomy tube. At the end of the operation, exchange into size 8 tracheostomy tube. Patient goes to intensive care unit for monitoring after completion of the operation without complications. Continue antibiotic treatment, which was started intraoperatively, for a further 2 days. Nutrition via PEG for approx. 1 week, then carefully build up diet. If necessary, optimize swallowing function by means of swallowing stabilization in the case of extensive mucosal resection in the area of the arytenoid fold with exposed arytenoid cartilage. Wait for the final histology and discuss the findings in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Transorale Laserresektion, Neck dissection sowie Tracheotomie

There is now an indication for tumor resection. Primary attempt from transoral. Due to the lack of adjustability and the localization in the area of the anterior commissure, an external approach was also discussed with the patient preoperatively. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the explained procedure preoperatively.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carrying out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Induction of anesthesia and intubation of the patient. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon. Insertion of the mouth guard. Insertion of the size D small bore tube. The tumor is now inspected with the aid of the support autoscope and the surgical microscope. Even after several attempts, the anterior commissure can only be visualized insufficiently. The decision is therefore made to access the tumor from the outside. Removal of the small bore tube. Positioning of the patient in head reclination. Skin spray disinfection and infiltration anesthesia. Skin wipe disinfection and sterile draping. First mark the thyroid incision. Marking of the planned incision using the broken-line technique. Sharp cutting of the cutis as well as the subcutis. Insert the retractors. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Locating the midline and lateralizing the musculature. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage and the ligamentum conicum. Incision of the perichondrium in the median line using the 15 mm scalpel. Creation of a horizontal incision in the area of the ligamentum conicum. Prepare two perichondrium flaps and also knock them aside. Opening of the larynx in the sense of a thyrofissure using the wheel. Insertion of the two-pronged retractor. A tumor is found in the area of the anterior and middle third of the left vocal fold. This reaches the anterior commissure. Incision of the tumor area with the 15 mm scalpel and removal of various marginal samples. During the intraoperative frozen section, tumor, i.e. carcinoma infiltrates, are still visible supraglottically on the left. In the cranial, caudal and supraglottic right margin samples, extensions of a carcinoma in situ are still visible. Therefore indication for resection and submission of new margin samples. These are now found to be tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. The extent of the resection therefore extended from the anterior commissure via the vocal ligament, vocal muscle and thyroarytaenoid muscle to just before the vocal process. Due to the extent of the tumor, the inner cortex of the thyroid cartilage is now cut with the diamond drill. Hemostasis by insertion of a suprarenin-soaked strip. This is followed by punctual hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Persistent dry wound bed at the end of the operation. Insertion of a 14-gauge wedge. Drilling of a total of four holes. Fixation of the wedge with Vicryl 3-0, followed by knocking back the neatly prepared perichondrium flaps and complete covering of the previously inserted wedge. In addition, readaptation of the previously mobilized prelaryngeal muscles. Prior to this, the wound is irrigated with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a sterile flap. Subcutaneous suture with Vicryl 4-0 and skin suture with Ethilon 5-0. Application of a wound dressing and a pressure bandage. Completion of the operation without complications. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist.

Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery is now indicated. Patient also informed about the necessity of flap coverage due to the extent of the tumor.","First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The exulcerated tumor is seen in the area of the edge and body of the tongue on the right, the tip of the tongue is recessed, palpation extends into the base of the tongue, does not cross the midline and merges slightly into the floor of the mouth. Overall, indication for the above-mentioned operation with flap coverage confirmed. Initial PEG insertion: Pre-mirroring with the gastroesophagoscope and insertion of the PEG tube using the thread pull-through method after a clear positive diaphanoscopy. No complications. Subsequent transoral tumor resection: insertion of Spandex, followed by insertion of a retractor to open the mouth. Snaring of the tongue. Subsequent resection of the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm macroscopically to 2 cm macroscopically on all sides. The right half of the tongue is removed, leaving out the most anterior parts of the tip of the tongue. Resection is performed next to the left raphe. Resection encompasses the floor of the mouth up to the alveolar ridge, taking all soft tissue down to the bone. The lingual nerve cannot be spared here and is also resected, as are parts of the sublingual gland and submandibular gland. Resection extends to the base of the tongue. The resection extends from the alveolar ridge over the anterior palatal arch to the right tonsil, which is also taken along with the anterior palatal arch. The specimen is then removed in toto and marked with sutures. It goes to the frozen section examination. In addition, the submandibular gland with attached soft tissue is removed transcervically and an extensive resection or marginal sample is taken from the soft tissue basally at the transition to the neck on the right. In combination with the main tumor and marginal samples, this results in an R0 situation. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Measure the size of the flap, which is approx. 12 x 8 cm. Drawing in three-dimensional requirements on the left forearm. Neck dissection on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME>/<CLINICIAN_NAME>: Incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle between the mastoid and 2 transverse fingers above the clavicle using a 10 mm scalpel.

Exposure of the omohyoid, digaster and submandibular gland on the left. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, which shows an anastomosis to the cervical plexus. The internal jugular vein, hypoglossal nerve, common carotid artery and vagus nerve are now also visualized and the neck preparation is successively replaced, starting with level II up to level V b. Macroscopically, several metastases requiring partial removal of the cervical plexus. The accessor nerve remains intact as well as the anastomosis to the cervical plexus. Level V b is also completely removed. No chyle fistula. Punctual hemostasis. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure using 3.0 Vicryl and 4.0 Ethilon. Neck dissection on the right by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle between the mastoid and 2 transverse fingers above the clavicle using a 10 mm scalpel. Sharp cutting of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma. Ligation and transection of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, the V. post of the digaster muscle and the left submandibular gland. Visualization of the accessorius nerve, which shows an anastomosis to the cervical plexus. Macroscopically, there are several metastatic masses. The largest in level II on the jugulofacial angle. This is successively replaced by the VJI and the facial vein. The hypoglossal nerve and the two veins can be spared. The common carotid artery and vagus nerve are now also visualized and the neck preparation is successively detached starting with level II up to level Vb. The accessory nerve remains intact as well as the anastomosis to the cervical plexus. Level V b is also completely removed. No evidence of chyle fistula. Punctual hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Submadibulectomy and removal of the lymph nodes of level Ib in toto. Now transection of the digastric muscle V. postior and breakthrough enorally. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery, the lingual artery and the facial artery as possible connecting vessels. Elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (12 x 7 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the pronator quadratus and flexor pollicis longus muscles with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vascular clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Defect coverage of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Removal of split skin from the right thigh and two-layer closure of the left forearm by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Then suturing of the flap. The flap is sutured successively, partly with the sutures in place, and the pedicle is pulled through in between. It can be seen that the flap can be sutured into the defect correctly in three dimensions without tension and without any problems. Subsequent vascular anastomoses. The radial artery is anastomosed with the superior thyroid artery after vessel conditioning using 9.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After conditioning of a thyroid vein and a facial vein, the vein is sutured with 3.0 and 2.5 mm couplers in the typical manner. In each case after opening the clamps, smear phenomenon positive and good venous return, also good arterial flow. Subsequent careful irrigation. Layered closure of the neck wound on the right with insertion of 2 flaps and on the left with insertion of a Redon drain. Finally, tracheostoma placement by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Dissection along the linea alba in depth. Push the infrahyoid muscles to the side. Exposure of the thyroid gland and ligation of the V. jugularis ant. Untermination and transection of the thyroid gland. Exposure of the front of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp in the form of a visor tracheotomy. Suturing in the usual manner. Thorough inspection of the flap. This is well supplied with blood. The procedure is then completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Flap control routinely for 5 days by means of enoral inspection. Postoperative continuation of antibiotics as already started preoperatively with Unacid i.v., feeding via the inserted PEG tube for 10-12 days, then gruel swallowing and, if necessary, diet build-up.

Tumor sits relatively flat on the anterior palatal arch, runs over the alveolar ridge onto the glossoalveolar groove, from there to just below the base of the tongue over the tonsillar lobe. The above-mentioned surgery was therefore indicated. The patient was also informed about covering the defect with a radial flap if necessary.","First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again. The tumor is found as described. This is followed by flexible esophagoscopy and, after the diaphanoscopy has been performed, a 15 mm abdominal wall probe is inserted in a typical manner without complications. Fixation of an abdominal wall in a typical manner. Then transoral resection. Tumor is incised on all sides with a safety margin of 0.5 to 1 cm and excised with relatively flat growth, especially in the palatal arch area, so that the underlying musculature is largely preserved. Resection via the alveolar ridge, preserving tissue on the bone. Resection goes over the glosso-alveolar groove down to the base of the tongue. In the area of the oropharyngeal side wall, removal of the tonsil and the outermost parts of the posterior palatal arch. Resection up to the beginning of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Resection also including the most lateral parts of the base of the tongue. Suture is thread-marked for histology. Preparation basally in healthy tissue, also laterally. Infiltrates still in situ in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall and the beginning of the posterior palatal arch. No infiltrates caudally. ............................. not cranially. The additional margin sample inserted laterally over the alveolar ridge and the glosso-tonsillar groove was healthy. This is followed by a resection approx. 1 cm wide, which extends from the middle area of the posterior palatal arch over the beginning of the posterior wall of the pharynx to the entrance of the hypopharynx. This extends cranially and caudally with a suture mark and remote from the tumor to the frozen section. Here in the middle area still in situ infiltrates, cranially and completely caudally free. Therefore, another resection from the same area, again at least 1 cm thick, which extends to the hypopharyngeal entrance. Now in the cranial and middle area still at least medium grade dysplasia, possibly already transition to higher grade dysplasia, in the caudal area now in situ. Therefore overall suspected field carcinomatization. A strip of mucosa is again removed from the mid to caudal area extending to the hypopharyngeal entrance. This is again thread-marked, but this time for final histology. Careful hemostasis. Termination of the procedure at this point. Overall, field carcinomatization. Now transfer to neck dissection: First neck dissection on the right: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Depiction of the omohyoid muscle, depiction of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, facial vein, superior thyroid artery. Exposure of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. Successive removal of the lateral neck preparation while exposing and preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Subsequent removal of the anterior neck preparation. The overall result is a level II-V removal. Clearly suspicious lymph nodes, at least 1-2, particularly in the Level II cranial region, followed by neck dissection on the left side. This is done in the same way as on the right side. The result is a level II-IV evacuation. Here too, at least clinically suspicious lymph nodes on the cranial side. Subsequently, careful hemostasis, irrigation of the wound area with H202 and Ringer's solution. Wound closure in layers and insertion of a Redon drain in each side of the neck. Then, in the case of an extensive defect, enoral decision to perform a tracheotomy in the sense of a protective tracheostomy. Small Kocher collar incision. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature. Splitting of these in the area of the.............................. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Undercutting this. Clamping, severing and supplying by means of puncture ligatures. Subsequent insertion into the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Creation of a wide pedicled Björk flap. This is successively epithelized in the typical manner. Subsequently insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. Check again enorally. No signs of bleeding. Completion of the procedure without complications. Overall cT2-3 oropharyngeal carcinoma. Due to the extensive and discontinuous growth, suspected field cancerization.

An exophytic tumor process with infiltration of the epiglottis can be seen starting at the free edge of the epiglottis on the right. The tumor continues across the aryepiglottic fold to just before the ary, a satellite focus is located slightly distant on the arytenoid mucosa, the main tumor mass is located in the right piriform sinus, which is subtotally filled, but the tip of the piriform sinus and the transition to the posterior wall of the hypopharynx are again tumor-free. Overall, there are clear perifocal extensions with a clearly uneven mucosa. Due to the extent, extensive cT2 with confirmed epiglottis infiltration cT3 tumor. Due to the size of the expected defect and the risk of pharyngo-cervical fistulization as well as the functional deficit due to the wound surface, the decision is made to proceed primarily transcervically with defect reconstruction. The patient is repositioned for this. First perform flexible esophagogastroscopy to insert the PEG tube. Enter with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. If the diaphanoscopy is good, the stomach can be punctured without any problems. Subsequent insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline, starting with the right side. Cervical cutting of skin and subcutaneous tissue along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. The facial vein is exposed and ligated. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve and exact location of the superior laryngeal nerve, prolonged exposure and tracing and preservation of the nerve beyond the tumor resection. The internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery are now exposed. A metastasis-highly suspicious lesion can be dissected from the surrounding area, several suspicious lesions along the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Excision of the accessorius triangle and level V, carefully preserving the transverse cervical artery of the cervical plexus and the vagus nerve. In toto removal of the neck preparation with in sano resection of all metastasis-suspected lesions. The thyroid cartilage is now released on the right side with dissection of the piriform sinus and visualization of the hyoid. Enter at the level of the right-sided vallecula. Widening of the pharyngotomy. Successive resection with 2/3 resection of the epiglottis, resection of the right aryepiglottic fold, resection of the arytenoid mucosa, leaving the intact joint intact. Subtotal resection of the right piriform sinus, the tip can be preserved. Resection up to the border of the posterior wall. After removal of the tumor, the specimen shows a somewhat scarce area basally, corresponding to the pre-epiglottic fatty tissue. This tissue is therefore completely resected. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for definitive histology together with the resected specimen. The invasive carcinoma is resected on the specimen R0, also in the basal section, only in the area of the pharyngeal side wall up to the cranial side is there a long stretch of Cis, so that an extensive resection is now carried out here. Renewed coverage with a mucosal margin sample, which was found to be completely free of tumor and dysplasia in the frozen section diagnostics, so that an R0 resection can be assumed. Measuring the defect and initially turning to plastic tracheotomy. Now turn to plastic tracheotomy. In the case of a post-thyroidectomy, use the old skin incision approx. 1 cm below the cricoid cartilage, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Removal of scars, exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea, insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring, creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and successive insertion of the tracheostoma. Neck dissection of the left side is then performed in parallel with radialis graft removal. For neck dissection: skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue, dissection of the platysma, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle, submandibular gland, removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical artery, facial vein and superior thyroid artery. Free preparation of the cervical vascular sheath with exposure and protection of the vagus nerve, exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve, removal of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Overall, no suspicious nodules here, so that after final wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and dry wound conditions, a 10-gauge Redon drain was inserted with careful two-layer wound closure. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Removal of the forearm flap to cover the right hypopharyngeal defect. Mark the size of the defect, which is 6 x 8 cm. Then mark a skin monitor approx. 1 x 2 cm slightly proximal to the graft. Incision of the skin. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle with exposure of the cephalic vein. Removal of the graft subfascially from the ulnar side. Exposure of the superficial venous system and removal of this. Exposure of the superficial ramus and radial nerve. Locating the radial artery. Clamping and ligation of this. Further removal of the radial and subfascial flap. Further subfascial dissection and elevation of the radial artery flap along the pedicle. Smaller outgoing vessels are bipolarly coagulated and treated, larger ones are clipped. In the elbow area, extension of the skin incision and exposure of the radial artery, radial vein, cephalic vein and inter cubital vein. The flap is removed. The veins are ligated and the radial artery is sutured with a 6-0 Vascufil suture. Irrigate the flap with heparin solution.

Carrying out the team time-out and preliminary consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. Induction of intubation anesthesia and intubation with a laser tube. Tube fixation in the left corner of the mouth. Head positioning in a slight reclining position by the surgeon. Entry into the larynx with the size D Kleinsasser tube and adjustment of the findings. There is an exophytic mass in the area of the anterior right vocal fold, which does not extend into the anterior commissure as described above, but ends 2 mm in front of it. Covering the patient with moist drapes and instillation of the CO2 laser. Successive laser resection of the findings with sufficient safety distance using 5 watts in continuous wave mode. The tumor can be held medially with the little tongue. The tumor extends approx. 2-3 mm below the free edge of the vocal fold. Dissection anteriorly down to the perichondrium of the thyroid cartilage. There is no evidence of infiltration of the anterior commissure, and certainly not of the left side of the vocal fold. Collection of 4 marginal samples (1: anterior commissure, 2: subglottic margin, 3: lateral margin of the vocal fold and 4: posterior margin) and submission of the samples for frozen section histopathological assessment. After feedback from the pathology colleagues, there was evidence of high-grade dysplasia in the area of the anterior and posterior commissure. Differential diagnostic artifacts due to the laser resection. After a detailed discussion of the findings, the colleagues could not decide whether it was an artifact or dysplasia. Therefore, in consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the decision was made to obtain 2 further marginal samples in the anterior and posterior commissure area and send them for final histopathological assessment. The operation was completed without complications and the surgical site was dry. Summary: Laser resection of a cT1a vocal fold carcinoma on the right side.

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was recommended. In the case of sonographic evidence of infiltration of the right common carotid artery, preoperative consultation was also carried out with colleagues from vascular surgery for a joint approach if necessary.","After intubation and induction of anesthesia by the anesthesiology colleagues, a pharyngo-laryngoscopy is performed for re-evaluation. Here, the exophytic tumor process can already be seen in the area of the right oropharynx, starting at the border to the hypopharynx, in the area of the right pharyngeal side wall, the extensive exophytic tumor process moves over the right pharyngeal side wall into the piriform sinus, fills it completely, fixes the larynx here over the medial wall and also clearly moves postcricoidally here, the esophageal entrance is free, as is the posterior wall of the hypopharynx. In the region of the endolarynx, it is edematous and swollen on the right and regular on the left. Due to the absolute fixation, confirmation of the indication for laryngectomy. The patient is now repositioned and xylocaine with adrenaline is injected. Lifting of a broad-based apron flap. Start with the right side first. Extensive metastasis consisting of 2 large conglomerates, one in level II with palpatory clear infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and one extending caudally to the supraclavicular region, mainly in level IV and V to Vb. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is visualized for orientation. Subsequently, the muscle is placed on the mastoid and caudally. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, which is also infiltrated in level IV, cranial exposure of the submandibular gland, exposure of the facial vein, which is later ligated, exposure of the digastric muscle, which can just be bluntly detached from the metastasis block. No infiltration here. Cranial exposure of the internal jugular vein, this is already very thin here, the accessorius nerve is no longer exposed here. Exposure and preservation of the carotid artery with hypoglossal nerve, exposure and preservation of the vagus nerve, cranial removal of the internal jugular vein, caudal dissection with subtotal resection of the cervical plexus. Skeletonization of the carotid bulb and the common carotid artery. After dissection, this can be pushed away from the metastatic block completely including the adventitia, partly bluntly, no signs of infiltration here. Caudally just above the mouth of the subclavian vein, separation of the internal jugular vein with overall extensive infiltration and obliteration, caudally good separation from the brachial plexus, no signs of infiltration here either, so that overall the complete metastatic block can be extirpated in toto and in sano. The vagus nerve was also preserved along the entire route. Residues of level Ia and level VI are extirpated, followed by visualization and release of the hyoid on the right side. Release of the thyroid cartilage in case of tumor growth, but certainly no tumor breakthrough. Covering of the soft tissues of the neck everywhere. However, the paralaryngeal muscles on the right side were left intact. Mobilization of the larynx only caudally. Detachment of the thyroid gland and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. Exposure and exposure of cricoid cartilage and trachea. On the left side now classic dissection and skeletonization of the larynx. Detachment of the paralaryngeal and infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the thyroid horn, sharp release of the piriform sinus. Now enter cranial to the hyoid due to the extent of the tumor on the left. Paramedian successive extension of the pharyngotomy via the left-sided vallecula, sparing and mucosa-sparing resection in the area of the aryepiglottic fold on the left up to the postcricoid while preserving and releasing the piriform sinus. On the right side, the tumor is incised in situ with a safety margin of approx. 1.5 cm, taking the pharyngeal musculature with it and thus also safely in sano in depth. Resection up to the postcricoid, here about half of the tumor is affected. Healthy conditions on all sides towards the esophageal entrance. Finally, removal of the specimen below the cricoid cartilage. Inspection of the tumor, practically no extension subglottically and wide in sano resection here, the tumor is resected in sano on all sides on the specimen, so that the marginal sample is taken on the specimen. Only in the area of the postcricoid region is there a somewhat narrower distance after removal of the tumor block, which is why complete imaging of the mucosa and margin samples is performed in situ. In the frozen section diagnostics, all marginal samples are free of tumor and dysplasia, so that an R0 situation can be assumed. The neck dissection of the left side is now performed. Here, metastasis at the transition from level II to Va behind the internal jugular vein. Macroscopic visualization of the omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Release of the submandibular gland, visualization of the omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Release of the submandibular gland, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, free preparation of the internal jugular vein while preserving the facial vein. Exposure and preservation of the accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve and cervical artery. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. The metastasis described above can be removed in sano without any signs of surrounding infiltration. Further borderline enlarged lymph nodes on the internal jugular vein are resected en bloc with the neck dissection which extends to level Va. Final palpation also on both sides in the nuchal and supraclavicular direction, no further abnormalities, so that after wound irrigation, the Provox voice prosthesis is initially placed here with a regular esophageal entrance, good mucosal conditions and a regular trachea. The trachea is adjusted by creating a dorsal elevation. Easy insertion of a size 8 Provox prosthesis at the most cranial point possible. Particularly in the area of the caudal pharyngeal tube and the esophageal entrance, the mucosa is wide, so that after a demonstration of the findings at <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> a primary suture of the mucosa is performed in several layers, especially including the base of the tongue in the case of a larger defect on the right side due to the extent of the tumor. Finally, wide conditions and an intact pharyngeal tube on all sides. Due to the skeletonized common carotid artery and the larger pharyngeal defect, the right thyroid lobe is now rotated to reline the pharyngeal suture. Release of the right thyroid lobe with removal of the inferior pole. The thyroid gland is now stitched onto the stalk of the superior thyroid artery and the accompanying veins, particularly on the cranial part of the pharyngeal suture. Good positioning. Subsequent final wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Careful two-layer wound closure and insertion of the tracheostoma. Subsequent problem-free reintubation to a size 10 low cuff cannula. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT4a cN2c cM0 G3 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Postoperatively, forced adjuvant therapy is certainly required due to the advanced metastasis. An X-ray pelvis was performed on the 10th postoperative day. If there are signs of a pharnygocutaneous fistula, please report this to the surgeon at an early stage.","Laryngektomie, Neck dissection sowie Tracheotomie

Subsequent neck dissection on the left side: Level II to IV are removed in the same way as on the right side. The thoracic duct is exposed caudally but not opened. Subsequent laryngectomy: mobilization of the laryngeal skeleton on both sides in the same way. Mobilization of the thyroid gland caudo-laterally. Exposure of the hyoid bone and detachment from the suprahyoid muscles. Exposure of the superior cornu and detachment of the pharyngeal constrictor and dissection of the piriform sinus. Subsequent entry into the larynx at the level of the epiglottis. Successive development of the larynx from cranial to caudal. The trachea was previously opened caudally and partially epithelized.

This is followed by irrigation of the entire wound area with H202 and Ringer's solution. Subsequent inspection of the neck skin and measurement of the defect. Measure the length of the pedicle. Mark the pectoralis flap in the appropriate size and at the appropriate distance on the right chest wall. Create a subfascial skin bridge on the pectoralis major flap. Then develop the pectoralis major flap successively by placing ........... sutures. The vascular pedicle was previously identified under the pectoralis major. Successive development of the flap along its pedicle up to the clavicle. Insertion of the flap under the skin bridge into the neck skin defect. Then suture the pectoralis flap into the skin defect and simultaneously epithelialize the tracheostoma. Closure of the neck skin with insertion of a Redon drain after careful hemostasis and repeated irrigation in layers on both sides. Subsequent mobilization of the thoracic skin and, after careful haemostasis and irrigation, low tension closure of this after insertion of 2 Redon drains. Insertion of a 10 mm tracheostomy tube without any problems. The procedure was completed without complications. Overall cT4a laryngeal carcinoma with invasion of the prelaryngeal skin and soft tissue. R0 situation, neck dissection on both sides of the suspicious cranial lymph nodes in level II on both sides. Postoperative according to the histological findings, at least RT, possibly RCT. Feeding via PEG tube for 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up.

Perform the operation in accordance with the treatment recommendation of the head and neck tumor board.","Active patient identification first. Carrying out the team time-out. Induction of anesthesia by anesthesia colleagues. Intubation via GlideScope, followed by pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy using a size D Kleinsasser tube. The main tumor mass is seen in the anterior third of the right vocal fold with slight extension into the right morgue sinus, there is no infiltration of the pocket folds on the right, caudal extension of approx. 0.5 to 1 cm towards the subglottic area, anterior infiltration of the anterior commissure can only be seen using the scope and infiltration of the left vocal fold to approx. the middle, here strictly glottic growth without supra- or subglottic extension. Due to the poor adjustability, confirmation of the indication for transcervical partial laryngectomy. Positioning, skin spray disinfection, application of 6 ml xylocaine with added adrenaline in the area of a skin fold at the level of the thyroid cartilage. Abjode and cover sterilely. Creation of an approx. 4 cm long skin incision horizontally cutting through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Creation of a subplatysmal skin flap cranially and caudally up to the level of the thyroid incisura and the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature, splitting of the same in the linea alba. Exposure of the crycothyroid membrane and the ligamentum conicum. Incision of the perichondrium in the midline and removal of cartilage laterally on both sides. Then horizontal incision of the ligamentum conicum and opening of the laryngeal lumen subglottically. Paramedian thyrotomy in the midline using a wheel and opening of the laryngeal lumen at the supraglottic level. Inspection of the findings from the cranial side and subsequent subperichondral dissection on the left side, including the endochondrium of the thyroid cartilage. Cut around the tumor specimen on the left side with sufficient safety distance macroscopically in sano supra- and subglottic and place posteriorly in the direction of the vocal process on approx. 1/2 length of the vocal fold.

Then perform the tracheotomy through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Re-intubation of the patient. Now first transoral tumor resection. After appropriate adjustment with the tonsil retractor, the tumor is resected with the monopolar caustic. Part of the soft palate on the left side or the uvula is resected. Laterally, the resection reaches the mandibular branch. Dorsally and medially, the tumor is successively resected in healthy muscle tissue. The resection continues into the glossotonsillar groove, which appears inconspicuous macroscopically. After removal of the tumor, peripheral incisions are made circumferentially, all of which are found to be tumor-free on frozen section histology. The selective neck dissection is then performed on the left side. After making the apron flap incision and dissection upwards, fixation upwards in the usual manner. Then skeletonize the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A large metastasis is found here in region II, which can be successively removed in toto after skeletonization of the digastric muscle. After opening and skeletonizing the vascular nerve sheath, regions I-V are resected while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. The large caliber jugular vein and the superior thyroid artery are skeletonized, exposed and preserved and are later used for anastomosis of the microvascular radial lobe graft. Subsequent transition to the opposite side. Here, after the initial start by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the same procedure with similar findings. Here, too, there is a mass in region II, albeit a smaller one, which is suspected to be metastatic. The hypoglossal nerve is then exposed on the left side and cut upwards. Dissection of the digastric muscle and creation of the pharyngotomy at the caudal resection margin of the transoral resection. Widen the access while protecting the lingual artery, the external carotid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Lifting of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Drawing of a graft in consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who measured the defect 9 x 6 cm. Marking of the radial artery, the ulnar artery and the cephalic vein. Then unwrap the arm and apply a 300 mmHg tourniquet. Incision of the skin and exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the cephalic vein which can be integrated laterally into the graft. Then expose the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Preservation of this nerve branch with all its additional branches. Exposure of the radial artery. Separation of the radial artery, lifting of the graft from the tendon bed and preparation in the usual manner up to the elbow. The radialis graft is then removed, taking with it the cephalic vein from the superficial system and the venous confluence and lifting a venous outflow from the deep venous system. The graft is then flushed with heparin and handed over to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who then sutures it in place. The defect is then covered with split skin from the right thigh in the usual way and the arm is closed in the usual way. The radial lobe graft is then inserted through the pharyngotomy into the resection defect. Fixation of the radial flap graft in the resection area. Subsequently, the microvascular anastomosis of the artery from the radial artery to the superior thyroid artery and the large-volume brachial vein to the facial vein is performed. The flap shows excellent perfusion on all sides. Application of a Redon drainage on both sides. Two-layer wound closure. Completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis and transfer of the patient to an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube. Sterile wound dressing on both cervical sides. Transoral inspection of the flap from which bright red arterial blood runs out at the upper pole after puncture. End of the operation and transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: partial oropharyngeal resection for tonsillar carcinoma on the left side. R0 resection on frozen section histology intraoperatively as well as macroscopically. Selective neck dissection on both sides. Defect coverage with microvascularly anastomosed radial artery flap graft from the left forearm and defect coverage on the left forearm with split skin from the right thigh. Arterial anastomosis to the superior thyroid vein and venous anastomosis to the facial vein. Creation of a PEG and a mucocutaneous tracheostoma. Intraoperative metastatic mass certainly on the left and also on the right, therefore adjuvant therapy is recommended postoperatively.","Transorale Tumorresektion, funkt.

This reveals a spherical mass in the area of the base of the tongue, which is covered by smooth mucosa, with otherwise normal, inconspicuous mucosal conditions and a relatively narrow pharynx. Then reposition the patient and insert the Fentex retractor and expose the base of the tongue. Extremely difficult to adjust here. In the end, however, it was possible to expose the tumor completely. Then insertion of the robotic instruments. Start the resection tangentially at the base of the tongue so that the tumor can be excised circularly with a sufficient safety distance to the tumor. This is done using monopolar coagulation and subtle hemostasis. Several marginal samples are then taken and sent in as frozen sections for histopathological tissue examination. These are found to be tumor-free intraoperatively. Subtle hemostasis again. Then removal of the robotic instruments and the Fentex retractor. Due to significant swelling in the area of the entire hypopharynx, the decision was made to tracheostomy the patient after he could only be intubated bronchoscopically by the anesthesia colleagues. This measure is carried out as a protective intubation. The patient is then repositioned, the neck is abducted and local anesthetic with adrenaline is injected. Then pretracheal skin incision and layered preparation in depth. Dissection of the pretracheal muscles in the midline, which is then dissected to the side. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is undermined and dissected after careful coagulation. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Then incision of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp. Preparation of a Björk flap. Then circular suturing of the trachea in the sense of anastomosis to the skin. Then insertion of an 8-bore tracheostomy tube through which the patient can initially continue to be ventilated without any problems. The procedure is then completed. Repeated enoral bleeding control, here dry wound conditions. The decision was therefore made to end the procedure and allow the patient to wake up, which was done without any problems. Further procedure depending on the result of the histopathological examination.","Transorale Tumorresektion mittels TORS

In addition, there is a 4 ˝ cm lymph node metastasis on the left with infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned operation.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthetist, 3 g of Unacid is administered preemptively. Flexible esophagogastroscopy is then performed under constant air insufflation. After positive diaphanoscopy, insertion of the trocar and placement of the PEG tube using the thread pull-through method in the typical manner. The tumor is now positioned with the spread laryngoscope. The left aryepiglottic fold is found to be about 1 cm wider, thickened and uneven without clearly exophytic tumor growth. Under the microscope, however, the clearly uneven mucosa is visible. The mass does not infiltrate the arytenoid cartilage and extends both endolaryngeally and towards the median piriform sinus wall over a width of approx. 5 mm. Cranially and anteriorly, it reaches the aryepiglottic fold without actually infiltrating the lateral side. Demonstration of the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who approves the procedure. Now the resection is started with the CO2 laser at 4 watts and continues mode, initially on the median side and at the border to the arytenoid cartilage. Then laterally over the base of the epiglottis into the pharyngoepiglottic fold. Laterally, the anterior piriform sinus wall is also resected in the entrance area of the piriform sinus and then the resection is completed along the median piriform sinus wall with a safety margin of approx. 5 mm. During the resection, a small arterial hemorrhage occurs once, which can be easily stopped using monopolar coagulation. After careful consideration of the tumor specimen, a decision is made to perform another small resection in the anterior and cranial area of the pharyngoepiglottic fold/laryngeal epiglottis junction. This is also done with the laser. Now, after consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, several marginal samples are taken: 1x medial to the aryepiglottic fold/transition pocket fold, 1x anterior cranial along the pharyngoepiglottic fold, the 3rd starting from the arytenoid cartilage over the median piriform sinus wall to the lateral and the 4th in the area of the wound bed. The frozen section diagnosis reveals mild to moderate dysplasia in the area of the median piriform sinus wall. A resection is therefore carried out in this area if the mucosa is normal and sent for frozen section diagnostics. A resection is also performed in the area of the median aryepiglottic fold/transition pocket fold if the mucosa is slightly suspicious under the microscope. The 2nd frozen section diagnosis now reveals non-irritant conditions in the area of the median piriform sinus wall, but a tiny carcinoma in situ in the area of the median aryepiglottic fold/pocket fold junction. Therefore, a second resection is performed here, which is sent for final histology and a second marginal sample of the aryepiglottic fold in the median direction. In between, neck dissection level I b to V b is performed on the left side, which involves partial resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and resection of the internal jugular vein and facial vein. Initial curved skin incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection through the platysma. Protect the external jugular vein. Now attempt to dissect the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. However, it quickly becomes apparent that this is cemented to the tumor conglomerate, but only in the central area. The anterior margin is therefore exposed in the caudal and cranial area and a partial resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is performed in the central area. The resection is then continued subglottismal to anterior, then the omohyoid muscle is followed posteriorly to anterior without the digastric venter muscle. The submandibular gland is skeletonized. In addition, the facial vein is identified and ligated. Then identify the hypoglossal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve and form the preparation from median to lateral. The thyroid gland and the deep laryngeal musculature are visualized in the caudal region. Now expose the internal jugular vein cranially and caudally of the tumor conglomerate. This is relatively small and without a lumen, so that a thrombosis of the vein must be suspected. It was therefore decided to resect and ligate the internal jugular vein in its cranial and caudal insertion. Now dissect along the common carotid artery from median to lateral. It can be seen that the tumor conglomerate can be easily pushed away from the carotid artery. In addition, identify the vagus nerve and spare the last one. Now laterally expose the scalene musculature. Identify the accessorius nerve, which can be spared, and complete the neck dissection in its lateral section from cranial to lateral while sparing the plexus branches and the accessorius nerve. In the deep caudal area, care is taken to resect level II b as well. Now careful hemostasis. Placement of a 10 Redon drain and two-layer wound closure using subcutaneous and skin sutures. After consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, a temporary plastic tracheotomy is performed: horizontal incision approx. 1 cm caudal to the cricoid cartilage. Dissection through subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure of pretracheal musculature. Spreading in the linea alba. Identification of the thyroid isthmus and undermining. Bipolization of the thyroid isthmus and spreading of the trachea. Opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring and epithelialization of the slit-shaped opening in the sense of a visor tracheotomy. Re-intubation with an 8 mm Rügheimer cannula. Now proceed to neck dissection of the right side selectively level II to IV. Dissection through subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Identification and protection of the accessorius nerve. Dissect the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial and expose the facial vein and, after isolating the cervical vascular sheath, form the lateral neck preparation from cranial to caudal while sparing the plexus branches and the accessory nerve. This is followed by resection above the venous angle after identification of the hypoglossal nerve and finally removal of the median neck preparation caudal to the facial vein. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation. Irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer. Placement of a 10 Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. The final frozen section diagnosis now results in an R0 resection, meaning completion of the procedure without bleeding and without complications. Conclusion: cT1 cN2b supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma of the left side, which was laser resected R0. Intraoperative administration of Unacid, which should be continued for 3 days. The patient should not be given any oral food for 1 week and then the cannula could be removed after a swallowing attempt.  ","Laserresektion, Neck diss., PEG-Anlage

Computed tomography showed no evidence of distant metastasis. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was decided.","First, after preparation by the anesthesia colleagues, the primary tumor region is inspected. An ulcerated tumor is found in the area of the soft palate with a depleted uvula. Infiltration of the right tonsil. Here infiltration beyond the tonsil capsule, laterally. The caudal tonsil pole is exceeded by palpation. In addition, clear infiltration on the right side of the posterior palatal arch up to the transition to the posterior pharyngeal wall. On the left side, the carcinoma moves to the left tonsil, does not infiltrate it palpatorily via the hianus capsule, but here too there is clear infiltration of the posterior palatal arch, also with transition to the posterior pharyngeal wall. The transoral procedure is now performed. Incision in the area of the mucosal level of the tumor with subtotal removal of the soft palate. Complete removal of the anterior left palatal arch in the sense of a tumor tonsillectomy. Release of the tonsil at the lower tonsil pole. No transgression of the tonsil capsule laterally, safe basal conditions here. Inclusion of the posterior palatal arch. Resection up to the posterior pharyngeal wall is necessary. Right-sided extended resection. Resection up to the parapharyngeal soft tissue of the neck. This ensures safe conditions basally. Resection caudally up to the entrance of the piriform sinus. Resection of the posterior palatal arch also up to the posterior wall of the oropharynx so that only a mucosal strip of approx. 3 to 4 mm remains in the area of the posterior wall of the oropharynx. Retraction of the soft palate. It can now be seen that the tumor is clearly infiltrating cranially via the posterior surface of the posterior palatal arch. Therefore extension of the resection. Resection down to the hard palate. Cut off the posterior edge of the maxilla down to the choanae and the posterior edge of the septum. For reasons of overview, the main tumor is removed first and isolated to the cranial part. Form a post-resection by removing the posterior edge of the maxilla as described above. Resection up to the tubal bulges. The ostia remain intact. Complete covering here in the nasopharyngeal region in the area of the mucosal settling margins. Otherwise, take marginal samples from the specimen. The specimen is thread-marked for definitive histology. Marking of the separated tumor portion, otherwise macroscopic in sano resection on the specimen. Complete covering of the tumor with margin samples as far as possible. In this case, frozen section diagnostics show an in sano resection for the invasive carcinoma. Only in the area of the margin in the area of the left lateral tonsillar lobe is there a CIS and in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall a suspicion of CIS as well as moderate dysplasia. A resection was performed in the area lateral to the left tonsil and covered with a new marginal specimen, which was found to be tumor-free. Due to the circumscribed pharyngeal remnant and the proximity of the tumor, the decision was made to completely resect the posterior pharyngeal wall and preserve the prevertebral fascia. After confirmation of the N0 situation, the neck is first dissected on the right side. To do this, make an incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digatric muscle. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein, internal jugular vein, facial vein, superior thyroid artery, cervical artery, hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the common carotid artery and vagus nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and completion of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Macroscopically conspicuous nodes in level II, otherwise macroscopically inconspicuous site. If the wound is dry, the tracheotomy is then performed. The skin incision is made horizontally below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Due to the height of the larynx, insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring. Formation of a visor tracheotomy and incision of the skin in the typical manner. Subsequent intubation onto a tube. At the end of the procedure, reintubation onto a size 8 low-cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. The anterolateral thigh graft is now lifted from the right after doppler sonographic identification of the main perforator and a secondary perforator. The graft, measuring 17 x 8 cm in total, is marked. Medial incision. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Cutting through the fascia lata. Exposing and securing the rectus femoris muscle. Subfascial dissection. Identification of the pedicle vessel. Subsequent identification of the main perforator. Dissection of the perforator down to the pedicle vessel with musculocutaneous perforator course. In the area of the perforator junction, leave the fascia lata on the graft, otherwise leave in situ. Complete resection and release. Isolation on the perforator and the pedicle vessel. Subsequent removal of the excellent vital graft after supplying the feeding and draining vessels. Careful monitoring of the thigh area and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful multi-layer wound closure with adaptation of the skin edges. The combined transcervical and transoral insertion of the graft is now performed. The conditions here are considerably more difficult due to the extensive defect. Finally, however, good reconstruction. In the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, the graft is sutured to the prevertebral fascia and a narrow exposed margin is left here. Good reconstruction of the soft palate and the nasopharyngeal section. Intact conditions on all sides. Stalk positioning to the right cervical side, after previous creation of a tunnel measuring approximately 3 transverse fingers. The superior thyroid artery is then dissected and conditioned. Perform the arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. This works well. Immediate venous return via both draining veins. First condition the facial vein. Perform the anastomosis with the coupler system. If there is still clear venous return via the second vein, the second vein is anastomosed to the external jugular vein, also using the Coupler system. Subsequently, a regular pedicle position and a positive spreading phenomenon and vital graft enorally, so that a 10 Redon drain is then inserted and the wound is carefully closed in two layers. Neck dissection on the left side. The skin incision here corresponds to the opposite side. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, facial vein, superior thyroid artery, cervical artery, hypoglossal nerve. Exposure and clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, vagus nerve and common carotid nerve and evacuation of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. If the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Subsequent careful two-layer wound closure and completion of the procedure with a vital graft and no indication of complications. Conclusion: Extensive growing cT3 cN2c oropharyngeal carcinoma on both sides with discrete right emphasis. Due to the extensive defect, initial feeding via the existing PEG tube for at least 8 to 9 days. If the graft heals properly, a gradual increase in nutrition can then take place; if necessary, a prolonged recovery of swallowing function can be expected due to the extent of the defect. Presentation at our interdisciplinary tumor conference to determine the extent of adjuvant therapy.","Resektion, Neck diss., Defektdeckung, Freier Lappen (ALT), Tracheotomie

The tumor extends from the arytenoid region to the anterior commissure. This is not exceeded and just barely not reached. Tumor grows broadly laterally in the direction of the laryngeal ventricle. Subsequent adjustment of the tumor with the support autoscopy and small bore tube size C. Removal of the tumor in the area of the anterior commissure, whereby this is just exceeded to the right in order to achieve an R0 resection. Lasering anteriorly up to the cartilage and pushing off the tumor. Right anterior margin from subglottic to supraglottic. Subsequent adjustment of the tumor dorsally. Laser the tumor with a safety distance of 3 to 4 mm, as already done in the front. The anterior and middle parts of the arytenoid cartilage are removed. Ablate the tumor from dorsal to ventral. Cartilage is reached laterally. The tumor is ablated just above the perichondrium. Particular attention is paid to a safe distance in the arytenoid cartilage area. Conus elasticus is also grasped caudally. First take a marginal sample dorsally from the area between the arytenoid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage, here extensive soft tissue is taken as a sample. Also mucosal margin sample in the arytenoid region. Further laser removal of the specimen along the perichondrium, taking the paraglottic musculature as far forward as possible. Removal of the specimen. This is thread-marked laterally, dorsally and caudally and sent for frozen section. The removed marginal samples are also sent to the frozen section, all of which are free. The specimen is also free, but just reaches the border laterally in the caudal direction. Therefore, the perichondrium is now removed from the cartilage and a soft tissue layer is removed caudally between the cricoid cartilage and the thyroid cartilage as a lateral-caudal margin specimen. The mucosa is also removed caudally in the area of the conus elasticus. This marginal sample is sent for final diagnosis. Subsequent careful hemostasis. The procedure is completed when the site is absolutely free of bleeding. Overall T1 to 2 glottic carcinoma with coverage of the entire vocal fold on the left and ingrowth in the direction of the laryngeal ventricle. Therefore, inclusion of cranial parts of the pocket fold and soft tissue up to the thyroid cartilage. Overall preparation R0 removed. A resection was carried out in areas where the margins were barely reached. Further procedure depending on the final histology. In any case, plan a follow-up endoscopy in 8 to 12 weeks.","Laserresektion

The B-image sonographic examination shows a lymph node metastasis in region II on the right side with relatively close contact to the tumor. Based on the findings, the indication for enoral tumor resection and bilateral neck dissection was concluded. The patient was informed preoperatively and had sufficient time to ask questions.","Transfer of the patient to the central OR (room 13). Introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleagues and induction of intubation anesthesia by the colleagues. Intubation with an 8 mm Woodbridge tube. Start of the operation using flexible gastroesophagoscopy by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Careful advancement into the stomach and air insufflation. Attempt to perform a diaphanoscopy, which is unsuccessful. Now aspiration of air and careful reflection back through the esophagus during air insufflation. Conclusion: Due to the negative diaphanoscopy, a PEG is dispensed with. The tumor is now positioned with the Kleinsasser tube size C. An ulcerative mass is seen in the area of the right oropharyngeal side wall, which merges into the right-sided base of the tongue. This mass extends cranially to the anterior palatal arch. The other mucosal areas are not suspicious. Now insertion of the Tors mouth retractor. Exposure of the tumor and docking of the robotic arms in the usual manner. The 0° optics are used. Now start the tumor incision after consulting the resection margins with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The tumor is removed at the cranial margin with sufficient safety distance (over 1 cm) in the area of the anterior palatal arch. Careful medialization of the tumour specimen and dissection using electrocoagulation in the parapharyngeal musculature. Constant attention is paid to maintaining a sufficient safety distance from the tumor. The parapharyngeal fat is visible laterally. Now also resection in the area of the base of the tongue with sufficient safety distance. The tumor resectate can now also be detached from the posterior wall of the oropharynx. Suture marking of the specimen and sending in for frozen section diagnostics as well as generous resection in the area of the anterior palatal arch from the parauvular to the alveolar ridge. Both specimens are thread- and needle-marked on a cork plate for histologic frozen section examination. After consultation with the pathologist, the main specimen showed an R0 resection in the cranial direction (parauvularly only just in the healthy area), and the resected specimen showed no further tumor cells. Conclusion: An R0 situation can now definitely be assumed with a wide safety margin on all sides. Subtle hemostasis is performed using bipolar coagulation forceps. As there is no major bleeding, a protective tracheostomy is not performed. The operation was completed without complications. Summary: Enoral robot-assisted tumor resection of a T2 N1 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right side with R0 resection confirmed by frozen section diagnostics.

In the findings of the CT scan, this does not appear to respect the boundaries of the tonsil and infiltrates the palate towards the uvula. In addition, there are conspicuous lymph nodes on both cervical sides.","First, panendoscopy and confirmation of the suspected diagnosis of cT2 tonsillar carcinoma. This shows an exophytic mass of the tonsil in the area of the upper tonsil pole. This spreads from here to the soft palate and reaches the base of the uvula on the right side. The lower tonsil pole appears tumor-free. However, there is a fish bone in the tonsil, which is removed. When looking forward with the small bore tube in the direction of the hypopharynx and larynx, the mucosal conditions are otherwise normal and inconspicuous. The hypopharynx in the sense of the piriform sinus can be fully unfolded on both sides and the postcricoid region as well as the esophageal entrance plane are inconspicuous. The endolaryngeal mucosa is also unremarkable. Rigid tracheobronchoscopy had already been performed during intubation. Here too, the subglottic and tracheal mucosa up to the main bronchi was unremarkable. After repositioning the patient, the flexible esophagoscope was inserted and the esophagus was visualized. This reveals a regular fold relief. With positive diaphanoscopy and a positive tent phenomenon, the PEG tube can then be inserted without any problems using the thread pull-through method. On reflection, the esophageal mucosa was carefully inspected again, which also proved to be non-irritating and unremarkable. This confirms the suspected diagnosis of an externally confirmed cT2 tonsil carcinoma, which is why the patient is now transferred for tumor tonsillectomy and neck dissection on both sides: First, skin incision along the soft palate and dissection of the anterior palatal arch caudally. At the lower pole, first expose the tonsil capsule. There is no evidence of tumor growth beyond the capsule. Therefore, expose the caudal pole vessels, which are then carefully coagulated and cut. The tonsil is then removed at the lower pole and dissected cranially. Then dissect into the soft tissue of the oropharyngeal side wall and the muscles of the palate. Maintain a sufficient safety distance of about 8 mm from the exophytic change in the upper pole of the tonsil. The resection is then performed up to the middle of the base of the uvula, which is then also resected. However, the tip of the uvula remains intact during the resection. After further posterior dissection, the tonsil can then be completely removed together with the exophytic change. Suture marking of the preparation is now carried out outside the site in the area of the margin of the abscess at the base of the uvula and in the area of the abscess margins in the area of the wound base at the caudal and cranial lateral tonsil pole. Circularly, the mucosa of the tonsil is also macroscopically inconspicuous on the preparation. The entire preparation is then sent for frozen section diagnostics. Intraoperatively, all suture markings are found to be tumor-free and the R0 resection is confirmed on the specimen. After subtle hemostasis, the wound surface of the uvula is fixed to the anterior soft palate in the area of the margin on the right side with several sutures. Then, after checking the bleeding again, removal of the mouth retractor and repositioning of the patient for neck dissection: After injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline in the area of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides of the neck, first abjode and position the patient. Then start the neck dissection on the right side with an incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. After cutting through the platysma, dissection in layers in depth. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the digaster muscle. Finding and protecting the accessorius nerve. A large lymph node conglomerate can be seen here in the area of the venous angle. Therefore, very careful dissection along the cervical vascular sheath and sharp dissection of the lymph node conglomerate from the cervical vascular sheath. All structures of the cervical vascular sheath are spared. Then develop the entire lateral neck preparation from the accessorius triangle to the level of the omohyoid muscle. Then evacuate the hypoglossal triangle while sparing the branches of the external carotid artery and internal jugular artery as well as the hypoglossal nerve. The caudal medial neck preparation is then also completely dissected, sparing the vascular branches. The entire neck preparation of the right side is then sent for histological examination. Subsequent subtle hemostasis and insertion of the Redon drainage. Then two-layer wound closure and repositioning of the patient for neck dissection on the left side: here too, skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth in layers until the cervical sheath is exposed. Then dissect and expose the omohyoid muscle and digaster muscle. Locate and protect the accessorius nerve. Then dissection of the entire lateral neck preparation from the accessorius triangle to the level of the omohyoid muscle. Then clearing of the hypoglossal triangle. Here too, a large lymph node conglomerate can be seen in the area of the venous angle, which must be dissected sharply away from the cervical vascular sheath during the dissection of the hypoglossal triangle. The entire dissection is carried out while protecting the outlets of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery. Finally, dissection of the caudal medial preparation, also with protection of the vascular outlets. After renewed subtle hemostasis, a Redon drain was also inserted here and then the wound was closed in two layers. The overall result is a selective neck dissection on both sides of levels II to V. At the end of the operation, the wound is checked again enorally. If the wound is dry, the procedure is then completed. Further procedure depending on the histopathological findings.","Transorale Tumortonsillektomie & Neck Dissection

Laryngoscopy was first performed using a Kleinsasser C-tube. This revealed a tumor that completely obstructed the entire laryngeal lumen from the median area of the aryepiglottic folds on both sides to the subglottic region. In addition, one has the impression that the tracheostoma has been inserted close to the tumor. Skin spray disinfection, application of local anesthesia cervically on both sides and around the existing tracheostoma. Skin ablation and sterile draping. Creation of a skin incision, transection of the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma and formation of a subplatysmal apron flap up to the level of the hyoid bone, which is then fixed in place using bridle sutures. The anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is then exposed on the right side. Exposure of the anterior jugular vein and the right external jugular vein, which are ligated and cut. Dissection along the sternocleidomastoid muscle in depth. The branches of the cervical plexus are exposed in depth and spared. Now also expose the omohyoid muscle and dissect along the muscle to the hyoid bone. Identification of the N. accessorius and free preparation of the nerve from the neck preparation. At the junction with the internal jugular vein, the digaster venter posterior muscle is exposed and completely freed from the neck preparation. Expose the submandibular gland and dissect the digastric muscle up to the hyoid bone. Now focus on the internal jugular vein just above the omohyoid muscle. Dissection shows that 2 lymph node metastases measuring approx. 1 cm are firmly attached to the vein wall. On closer examination, the high-grade evidence of infiltration of the vascular wall is revealed. In consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, it was decided to include the internal jugular vein in the neck preparation. For this purpose, expose the vein cranially just below the digastric muscle and caudally just cranial to the omohyoid muscle. Expose the common carotid artery, the carotid bifurcation and the vagus nerve along the entire course of the dissected vein. Now first remove the vein caudally and place 2 vascular ligatures on the vascular stump. The same procedure is also carried out cranially, sparing the hypoglossal nerve and the accessory nerve. Both nerves can be exposed and spared. The entire neck preparation is then removed from cranial to caudal, including the vein and constant bleeding control using bipolar coagulation forceps. The preparation is carried out with constant consideration of the nerves of the cervical plexus and the phrenic nerve on the scalene muscle. Removal of the neck preparation without complications. Hemostasis dorlt by means of bipolar coagulation and subsequent repositioning of the patient on the left side to perform the neck dissection. Dissection along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, digaster muscle and omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Successive evacuation of the posterior and anterior neck preparation while sparing the above-mentioned structures and the plexus branches. In region IV, several suspicious masses were found on the left side, which were then removed with the specimen. Hemostasis there by means of bipolar coagulation. Subsequently, the skin of the already existing tracheostoma was cut circularly. Additional removal of the prelaryngeal fatty tissue subplatysmal. Both samples are sent for intraoperative frozen section examination, which results in the diagnosis of cancer-free findings in both cases. Due to the infiltration of the laryngeal skeleton at the level of the thyroid cartilage as demonstrated by computed tomography, it is decided to resect the prelaryngeal musculature in the laryngeal specimen. This is then cut caudally at the level of the cricoid cartilage and cranially at the level of the hyoid bone and removed in the laryngeal preparation. The hyoid bone is then skeletonized and the thyroid cartilage is skeletonized at its posterior edge on both sides. Care is taken to ensure that the prelaryngeal musculature with the thyroid cartilage is also removed in the preparation. Subperichondral dissection on the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage on both sides and maximum protection of the piriform sinus on its outer side. Subsequent exposure of the free epiglottis margin and median pharyngotomy. Dissection along the lateral edges of the epiglottis and the aryepiglottic folds on both sides. Maximum protection of the pharyngeal mucosa in the area of the piriform sinus from cranial to caudal on both sides. Transverse mucosal incision in the postcricoid area, joining the lateral incisions with this transverse incision and entering the region between the posterior wall of the trachea and the anterior wall of the esophagus. Dissection caudally in this layer. Repeated hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Dissection of the thyroid gland from the side wall of the trachea on both sides. Dissection revealed that the tracheostoma had been inserted between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage clasp and thus clearly in the area of subglottic tumor spread. Decision to remove the former tracheostoma in the tumor preparation. Exposure of the anterior tracheal wall caudal to the existing tracheostoma and incision between the 3rd and 4th tracheal cartilage clasp. Partial epithelialization of the new tracheostoma at its lower edge. Removal of the laryngeal preparation in toto, which is sent in thread-marked for intraoperative frozen section examination. In addition, the following edge samples are sent for intraoperative examination: Tracheostoma anterior margin, lateral tracheal wall left, lateral tracheal wall right, postcricoid mucosa, base of tongue midline, lateral pharyngeal wall right, lateral pharyngeal wall left. In the last 2 marginal samples and more precisely in their cranial part, CIS parts are then detected during the intraoperative frozen section examination. Thus, generous resection in this region and removal of 2 further marginal samples from the right and left cranial pharyngeal side wall, which were found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleagues in the intraoperative frozen section examination. Hemostasis there by means of bipolar coagulation. Cricopharyngeal myotomy in the typical manner. Subsequent 3-layer pharyngeal suture (thin submucosal connective tissue layer, striated pharyngeal wall musculature, residual prelaryngeal musculature). The pharyngeal suture is then reinforced with several pieces of Tachosil cut to size. Dry conditions, insertion of 2 Redon drains on both sides. Completion of the epithelialization of the tracheostoma at its cranial and lateral edges. Prior to this, the tracheal findings were shown to colleagues <CLINICIAN_NAME> and the joint decision was made not to use a Provox prosthesis due to the residual trachea being too far caudally. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure bandage. The procedure was completed without complications. PEG placement was dispensed with in the absence of preoperative surgical information. However, this should certainly be carried out during the course of the operation, especially with regard to the necessary adjuvant therapy. Conclusion: Complete laryngectomy, modified radical neck dissection on both sides of region Ib-V with resection of the right internal jugular vein. Control of the pharyngeal suture by means of X-ray and suture pull on the 10th day requested, rapid presentation of the patient to our tumor board after receipt of the final histology for the purpose of planning further therapy. Due to a lack of information, a PEG was not used in this procedure.  ","Laryngektomie, Neck diss. bds., Tracheostomarevision

The restless mucosa ends purely macroscopically in the anterior commissure or slightly to the left of it. The restless mucosa lies against the cartilage but does not appear to infiltrate it. On the left side, the restless mucosa does not so much extend to the glottis as to the subglottis. On the right side, the subglottis is free. Due to the poor adjustability, decision to perform a partial laryngectomy from the outside. Positioning of the patient. Injection of 6 ml local anesthetic with added adrenaline in the prelaryngeal area of the planned incision. Abjode and cover. Zigzag-shaped skin incision with horizontal skin tension lines. Preparation on the larynx. Separation of the prelaryngeal musculature in the linea alba. Incision of the perichondrium and pushing off with the Freer. Opening of the larynx through the thyrofissure in the median line using a circular saw. Dissect the larynx and inspect the tumor. This appears as described above. Start on the non-tumor-bearing left side. Separation of the vocal fold and the supraglottis with sufficient safety distance from the tumor. Also removal of the subglottic area. Push the soft tissue away from the thyroid cartilage using a raspatorium. Move to the opposite side after incision of the cricothyroid membrane. Here, too, incision of the tumor, cranial horizontal incision in the upper part of the pocket fold up to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage, which is exposed at the end of the operation. Resection of the right vocal fold, subglottic resection with sufficient safety margin. Also here, removal of the thyroid cartilage and retrieval of the complete tumor specimen. Finally, marginal samples are taken supraglottically from the wound bed and subglottically, all of which are found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. As far as possible, a Kleinsasser mucosal flap is sutured to the still existing soft tissue on the right side. The patient receives 2 g ceftriaxone during the operation. Closure of the ligamentum conicum with 3.0 Vicryl sutures. In addition, connection to the inferior edge of the thyroid cartilage, after creation of suture-absorbing holes with the Lindemann reamer. Insertion of a 16 mm Keel and drilling of corresponding holes in the thyroid cartilage. Readaptation, with insertion of the Keel and closure of the thyrofissure. Readaptation of the periochondrium as far as possible and adaptation of the overlying musculature. Subcutaneous suture, with reconstruction of the intended skin incision. Skin suture with 6.0 Prolene. Prior to this, insertion of a flap to prevent air emphysema. Dressing applied. Completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: R0-resected cT2 glottic carcinoma on both sides, right-sided. Please continue Ceftriaxone for the entire duration of hospitalization.","KK-Teilresektion nach Leroux-Robert

First PEG insertion in the usual manner using the thread pull-through method. In this case, PEG insertion is successful with good diaphanoscopy. Insertion of the spandex and looping of the tongue and inspection of the tumor. The tumor is located on the right side wall of the oropharynx, starting at the anterior palatal arch and passing onto the tonsil as well as at the edge of the base of the tongue on the right. The mucosa around the tumor is incised with a monopolar needle and then the tumor is successively removed with scissors and bipolar forceps as far as possible from the upper transoral area. The tumor itself extends very far laterally into the soft tissues of the neck, so the remaining part must then be removed transcervically. Start with the neck dissection on the left side. Skin incision in a preformed skin fold across the neck, three transverse fingers below the lower jaw. Initial exposure of the platysma. Formation of a platysma flap cranially. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid and the omohyoid, the cervical vascular sheath and free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Resection of the neck block II to V, sparing the plexus branches and the hypoglossal nerve as well as the facial vein. Removal of the submandibular gland and transection of the digastric muscle to gain access to the oropharynx. Residual resection of the tumor and formation of an enoral bridge. The tumor is sent for final histology and samples are taken from all the margins for frozen section without the pathologist being able to find carcinoma or carcinoma in situ. Neck dissection is performed on the right side. For this purpose, a transverse skin incision is also made on the neck. Exposure of the platysma. Formation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid and omohyoid. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Removal of the neck preparation II a to V a, sparing all nerves and vessels except for the external jugular vein, which is ligated. The submandibular gland is left on this side. Despite everything, level I is also removed on both sides, as the tumor has partly spread to the anterior floor of the mouth. Repositioning to elevate the radialis graft. Marking of the graft and the skin incision. A 5 x 7 cm incision is made around the graft. First dissection of the venous plexus in the crook of the elbow. A good superficial and deep venous system with a relatively weak confluence can be seen. Then visualization of the brachialis muscle and the superficial venous system. Integration of a superficial vein into the graft. Exposure of the superficial ramus, radial nerve. Exposure of the radial artery and repositioning of this. Lifting of the radialis graft first from the lateral, then from the medial side. Dissection of the pedicle with clipping or bipolar coagulation of outflows. Deposition of the graft in the crook of the elbow, leaving one superficial and one deep vein for the connection. Insertion of the graft into the oropharynx and suturing of the graft from the soft palate and transcervically into the oropharynx. Suturing is extremely difficult as the tongue is very swollen and must be done mostly transcervically. Repositioning for anastomosis of the vessels. First dissection of the superior thyroid artery as the connecting vessel from the neck. Dissection of the radial artery on the graft and anastomosis of this. This has to be performed twice, as the flow was too low the first time, but the second time the blood flow to the graft was satisfactory with clearly good return flow in both graft veins. For this, the facial vein is taken once and another small accompanying vein, both of which are anastomosed using a coupler. Positioning of the pedicle with the help of Gelita and insertion of a Redon drain on both sides as well as two-layer skin closure. A tracheotomy is performed in the usual manner using the visor technique at the same time as the forearm is being sutured. Skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection down to the musculature. Pushing the muscles aside. Exposure of the thyroid gland. Separation of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Insertion between the second and third tracheal cartilage. Formation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis in the upper and lower part. Removal of the full-thickness skin from the groin in the usual manner. Insertion of a Redon drain in the groin and two-layer wound closure. The full-thickness skin is thinned and transplanted to the defect on the arm. On the arm, adaptation of the wound edges in the upper part. The full-thickness skin is sutured into the defect area with single button sutures. Perforation of the full-thickness skin and application of a VAC dressing. Apply a pressure of 75 mm Hg to the VAC dressing. Re-intubation and transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation. Continue antibiotics for 24 hours. Regular daily graft checks and clinical diet build-up, without X-ray emesis, on the 10th postoperative day. Presentation of the patient at the tumor conference after receipt of the histology.

This proved to be extremely difficult as the supraglottic tumor masses almost completely obstructed the pharyngeal and laryngeal entrance. After laborious attempts, a tube was finally placed. Performing pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy with the small bore tube. The tumor described above can be seen in the area of the epiglottis. The epiglottis is completely consumed, the tumor extends over both aryepiglottic folds to the arytenoid cartilage, on the right side the arytenoid cartilage is completely infiltrated, on the left side it extends to the arytenoid cartilage. The pocket folds are infiltrated on both sides and the lateral edge of the vocal fold is also infiltrated on the right side. Then injection of Ultracaine and sterile washing and covering. Creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Start with neck dissection on the right side. This shows several large metastases in the area of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the cervical vascular sheath. First visualization of the submandibular gland and the omohyoid muscle. Visualization of the digaster and hypoglossus. The metastases cannot be detached from the sternocleidomastoid muscle, nor from the internal jugular vein. The common carotid artery is displaced far to the dorsolateral side. Now switch to the left side in order to obtain the internal jugular vein. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the omohyoid muscle. Then expose the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and detachment of the neck preparation from the cervical vascular sheath. Several large metastases here too. Here, the larynx is first dissected by detaching the thyroid gland, the superior thyroid artery and severing the upper laryngeal bundle. Detachment of the oblique laryngeal muscles. Change to the opposite side. Continuation of the neck dissection by separating the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the lower attachment. It can be seen that a large metastatic conglomerate extends below the clavicle. Careful dissection here. Separation of the internal jugular vein and high dissection of the conglomerate, detaching it from the common carotid artery and later from the bulb. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is also severed in the upper part. The accessorius nerve can be preserved here. Separation of the internal jugular vein and removal of the large metastatic conglomerate. Then removal of the remaining fatty tissue from level II b, sparing the plexus branches. Level VI was integrated into the metastatic conglomerate. Now release of the larynx. Detachment of the oblique laryngeal muscles. Separation of the laryngeal bundle. Detachment of the thyroid gland and the cervical vascular sheath at the larynx. Detachment of the hyoid bone at the base of the tongue. Integration of the hyoid bone into the laryngeal preparation. Now perform the tracheotomy. For this, insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage and reintubation onto a laryngectomy tube. Now release the piriform sinus, first on the right side, then on the left side, in the usual manner. This must be done very carefully so as not to ........ into the tumor. Then enter the pharynx from the left side. This must be done relatively high up, as the tumor is a supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma with complete infiltration or consumption of the epiglottis. This is then carefully dislocated upwards. Then incision of the mucosa along the epiglottis borders up to the postcricoid region on the left side, then the same on the right side, while sparing the piriform sinus. Now place the larynx below the cricoid cartilage. Suture marking. Taking marginal samples. The marginal sample of the lateral pharyngeal wall still shows carcinoma in situ in the center. A resection was performed and a final margin sample was taken. Final complete R0 situation. In the meantime, a Provox prosthesis of size 8.0 was placed in the usual manner using the pull-through method. Then, in the meantime, completion of the neck dissection on the left side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. For this purpose, the neck preparation was removed while sparing the plexus branches and the accessorius nerve at level II a to V a. The internal jugular vein and superior thyroid artery were preserved. Now start with the pharyngeal suture, initially in the base of the tongue with creation of a small T, but the mucosa is very dilapidated and begins to tear towards the oropharynx on both sides. Intraoperative demonstration to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. He recommends reopening the previously sutured pharyngeal suture and starting again. This is also the same as the first time with the same result that the mucosa tears again and again due to maceration. Finally, the mucosa in the area of the oropharynx must be sutured transorally and then the pharyngeal suture must be sutured in the usual manner, first in the area of the base of the tongue and then in the area of the mucosa in two layers with single button sutures. Finally, readaptation of the pharyngeal muscles so that no laryngeal stenosis occurs. Then incision of the tracheostoma and creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis and reintubation to a 10 mm tracheostomy tube. Two 10-gauge Redon drains were inserted beforehand and the procedure was completed with a two-layer wound closure. Please check the wound daily and open the throat extensively if a fistula occurs. The risk of fistula is greatly increased in this patient due to the difficult pharyngeal-mucosal conditions. A nasogastric tube is not inserted so that no additional foreign material is placed in the affected pharyngeal mucosa. X-ray gruel swallow on the 12th postoperative day. Continuation of antibiotics for 1 week.","Laryngektomie, Neck diss., Tracheotomie, Provox-Prothese

The above-mentioned surgery was therefore indicated. There is also cN1 status on the right.,"Reclination of the head. Applying the mouth retractor. Exposure of the tumor. Transoral resection: The tumor is incised on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1 to 1.5 cm. The tonsil lobe, anterior palatal arch, mucosa of the glossotonsillar junction and also approx. 25-30% of the right tongue base are removed. The resection extends caudally to the hypopharyngeal entrance. The specimen is thread-marked. After inspection of the tumor specimen, a cranial margin sample is taken from the palatal arch area. Also take a basal-lateral marginal sample from the pharyngeal wall area, behind the tonsillar lobe or in the direction of the glossotonsillar junction. In the frozen section, specimen R0 on all sides, somewhat scarce basally, but now an R0 situation when viewed together with the marginal specimen. Careful hemostasis is performed. During the transoral resection, the lingual artery was stitched and treated with clips. Re-inspection shows clips in situ, no evidence of bleeding. PEG insertion: insertion of the gastroscope. Pre-mirroring into the stomach. After creating a spontaneous diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube in a typical manner without complications. This is also fixed to the abdominal wall in a typical manner. Repositioning for neck dissection on both sides and tracheotomy. First sterile draping after skin disinfection and after injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. Beginning with neck dissection on the right: typical skin incision. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid and digastric muscles and infrahyoid muscles. Then exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, submandibular gland, vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. All structures are preserved. Removal of the larger, clearly malignant suspicious masses as part of the neck preparation. This is followed by a level II to V excision while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Finally, careful haemostasis with RZZZ dissolution and layered wound closure with insertion of a Redon drain. Tracheostoma creation: This is performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Small Kocher collar incision. Exposure of subcutaneous tissue and transection of this. Veins are ligated. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. This is divided. Exposure of thyroid cartilage and thyroid isthmus. Undercutting of the thyroid isthmus, clamping, severing and treatment using puncture ligatures. Subsequent exposure of the trachea. Finally, creation of a broadly pedicled modified Björ flap. This is epithelized in a typical manner. Insertion of a 7 mm tracheal cannula. Neck dissection is then performed on the left through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Marking of the skin incision and careful skin incision and dissection of the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Cut through the platysma and bluntly push the platysma away from the cervical fascia. Start dissection with the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Here the anterior margin is sought out and carefully dissected from the center of the muscle caudally (region IV). This reveals the omohyoid muscle, on whose muscle belly the dissection is carried out further cranially. Sharp dissection of the submandibular gland and elevation of the gland. Below the gland, the digaster muscle is now sought out and followed in the direction of the mastoid. This is done by means of blunt dissection and with protection of the facial vein. Locate the triangle between the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. Clearing out the neck preparation. Careful preliminary work laterally on the omohyoid muscle and medially on the internal jugular vein in order to clear the medial neck preparation. This is achieved without any problems. Move on to the lateral compartment. Here the jugulofacial angle is carefully exposed. Below the vein, the hypoglossal nerve can be seen, which is exposed approx. 1 cm wide and can be spared without any problems. Continue laterally to the upper part of the sternocleidomastoid. The accessorius nerve is located here. Spread in the direction of the nerve and locate the nerve. This is spared. Now continue preparation with level IIb. Here, bipolar coagulation and sharp dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the digaster to region IIb is performed and the preparation is pulled through under the accessorius nerve. Further dissection caudally at the internal jugular vein. The common carotid artery is also exposed and the vagus nerve is visualized. This is done without any problems and both structures can be spared. Now continue dissection of the lateral compartment from cranial to caudal. The caudal border is defined as the omohyoid muscle, the deep border as the plexus branches. All these structures can be spared. After completion of the dissection of the lateral compartment, there is no evidence of a chyle fistula. The cervical sinus could not be spared. After careful hemostasis with bipolar coagulation, irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer. Insertion of a drain ( 10 ) and two-layer wound closure. Subsequent re-inspection of the wound surface intraorally after insertion of the McIvor spatula. Small areas of mucosal bleeding are still visible. These are stopped. No further bleeding. Stable vascular situation in the area of the clips. Due to the somewhat more extensive resection, exposure and ligation of the lingual artery from the cervical side was omitted, as there would otherwise have been a risk of a fistula. Stable situation at check-up, no bleeding. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please feed via the PEG system due to the extensive transoral resection. Please continue antibiotics for one week with Unacid, which was given intraoperatively. Overall cT2 cN2b tonsillar carcinoma.

This shows the large tumor of the left piriform sinus with transition to the laryngeal skeleton and the postcricoid region. Removal of the instruments while protecting the edentulous maxilla. Followed by sterile washing and draping. First perform the tracheotomy through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasps. Then draw in and incise the apron flap, which is folded upwards. Careful dissection in the area of the left cervical vascular nerve sheath in the case of left carotid disobliteration. Then skeletonize the vascular nerve sheath on the right side with exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and release of the hyoid bone. Subsequent removal of the attachment of the constrictor pharyngis muscle to the lateral thyroid cartilage and extensive release of the piriform sinus on the right. Dissection of the thyroid lobe after cutting through the straight neck muscles. This mobilizes and sufficiently develops the larynx on the right side. Then transition to the opposite side. A similar procedure is performed here, whereby the common carotid artery is first accessed caudally in the area of the scar plate and dissected upwards. Here too, as on the opposite side, the superior thyroid artery can be dissected free for a possible microvascular anastomosis. Subsequent cranial placement of the hyoid bone. Dissection onto the epithelium of the epiglottis and disluxation of the epiglottis. Incision of the hypopharynx. Then the exophytically growing tumor is seen, which is successively released while leaving out the right piriform sinus. The right piriform sinus is naturally included and the two incisions are joined caudally at the cricoid plate. The larynx is then set down on the cricoid and a caudally pedicled mucosal flap is prepared for the Herrmann chimney. The larynx can now be completely removed together with the tumor. On macroscopic observation, all tumor margins are sufficiently distant from the tumor. Nevertheless, marginal incisions are made circularly from the pharyngeal defect. A questionable infiltration with a CIS is seen in the area of the upper right hypopharynx, which was furthest away from the tumor. A resection is therefore performed here. All other marginal areas are free of carcinoma and dysplasia on frozen section histology. Now insertion of a provox prosthesis in the usual manner. Myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle. Subsequent closure of the pharyngeal defect, which is sufficiently wide due to the still existing right piriform sinus, with a first layer of continuous T-shaped Conley suture. The second layer contains the overlying tissue using a single-button technique. Suturing of the mucosal flap to cover the Herrmann chimney. This is followed by bilateral selective neck dissection of regions II-V while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. Insertion of a Redon drain on both sides. Folding back of the apron flap, multi-layer wound closure and completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis in the area of the tracheostoma. Finally, sterile wound dressing and reintubation of the patient to a 3-bore cannula. End of the operation, transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy on the left side for cT4 piriform sinus carcinoma. Selective neck dissection of regions II-V on both sides. Primary voice rehabilitation with a Provox Vega voice prosthesis 8 mm. Installation of a Herrmann chimney.","Laryngektomie mit Teilpharyngektomie, selektive Neck dissection, Provox

The piriform sinus is tumor-free. Sonographically there is a cN0 neck status.,"First confirm the findings described above. Then placement of the LARS retractor and docking of the da Vinci robot. This provides a good overview of the tumor. The main tumor mass is located in the vallecula of the left side. The epiglottis appears somewhat infiltrated up to the midline. However, the midline is not crossed. The resection is then performed from the base of the tongue, cranially to caudally. The resection reaches the hyoid bone at the front. The epiglottis is bisected in the middle. Due to the extent of the tumor and for a better overview, the upper part of the tumor must first be removed. The resection is then continued. During hemi-epiglottectomy, the tumor is found to have grown supraglottically and endolaryngeally. The resection is therefore performed up to the supraglottis at the level of the pocket crease on the left side. Dorsally and laterally, the resection reaches the pharyngoepiglottic fold, which can be completely resected. The left ary remains intact. The tumor can then be completely removed. Representative samples are taken from the margins of the cranial and lateral resection area. Likewise, marginal samples are taken from the epiglottic margin, the supraglottic margin and the caudal margin at the base of the tongue. All marginal samples are examined intraoperatively as a frozen section and found to be tumor-free. During resection of the tumor, venous bleeding is seen in the area of the base of the tongue. This bleeding can be stopped using several vascular clips. Repeated careful hemostasis after taking a marginal sample. Then dry wound conditions. Due to the extent of the tumor and the resection area, the decision is made to perform a protective tracheostomy. Removal of all instruments and the blocker and undocking of the da Vinci system. Repositioning of the patient for the tracheostomy. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline in front of the trachea. Subsequent transverse incision and layered preparation in depth. Exposure of the pretracheal neck vessels and veins. These are undermined and ligated. Exposure of the prelaryngeal and infrahyoid musculature. Finding the midline. Dissection of the midline and separation of the musculature. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is then undermined and cut on both sides after ligation. Then expose the anterior surface of the trachea. Entering the trachea between the second and third cartilage clasp. Preparation of a Björk flap. Circular suturing of the tracheostoma and epithelialization. Then insertion of an 8 mm tracheostomy tube. Completion of the procedure after bandaging. The patient is transferred to the ENT intensive care unit for monitoring. After checking the swallowing function, the patient may have to be fed nasogastrically with a feeding tube for the next few days in the event of aspiration. The patient should always remain under intensive medical supervision over the weekend.","Transorale roboterassistierte Resektion

The panendoscopy and sampling performed <2016> revealed a T2 hypopharyngeal carcinoma, which protrudes very close to the cervical vascular sheath laterally. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","Induction of anesthesia and transnasal intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the hypopharynx and larynx. An exophytic tumor can be seen on the left side wall of the hypopharynx, extending to the entrance of the piriform sinus. The postcricoid region, the esophageal entrance and the tip of the left piriform sinus are free. The entire glottis is also free. Preoperatively, it was not possible to see the mobility of the left vocal fold due to tumor displacement. However, it is now apparent that the left arytenoid cartilage is not affected by the tumor. Due to the extension in the direction of the cervical sheath and the difficulty of adjustment, the decision was made to resect the tumor transcervically and, if necessary, cover it with a transplant. Injection of Ultracaine, then sterile washing and covering. Creation of an apron flap, then start with the neck dissection on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland. Level II shows a large conglomerate of lymph nodes which lies on the internal jugular vein. The internal jugular vein can be freed from the conglomerate. The facial vein is infiltrated and must be removed. Expose the hypoglossal nerve and the accessorius and release the remaining neck preparation level II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. Now release the hyoid bone on the left side and remove the left half of the hyoid bone to gain direct access to the pharynx. Bimanual palpation from the transoral side and identification of the tumor. Release of the piriform sinus below the thyroid cartilage. Entering the pharynx above the tumor on the pharyngeal side wall. Inspection of the tumor. Now remove and cut around the tumor with a safety margin of 2 cm. The tumor can be retrieved enbloc and is placed completely on cork for frozen section. All edges as well as the wound bed are in sano in the frozen section. Due to the large defect, primary closure of the pharynx is no longer possible. Therefore, measurement of the defect and decision to cover the defect using a radialis graft. Start of elevation of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Marking of the graft 15 x 10 cm. Cutting around the skin island and opening the skin on the forearm. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the cephalic vein. <CLINICIAN_NAME> takes over the elevation of the radialis graft, dissects further and exposes the superficial ramus of the radial nerve, lifts the graft away from the tendon bed and first exposes the radial artery. There is good perfusion of the hand, which can also be verified by pulse oximetry. Further release of the graft and preparation of the vascular pedicle in the usual manner. The radial artery can be removed in the crook of the elbow, including the venous confluence with the possibility of venous connection of a superficial and a deep vein. Then usual closure of the forearm with split skin from the right thigh by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The full-thickness skin was removed by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Parallel to the elevation of the radialis graft, the neck dissection is performed on the right side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. After the neck dissection on the left side, the patient is repositioned for the neck dissection on the right side. Incision already made as part of the previous dissection incisions. Locate the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissect its anterior border in depth. Exposure of the anterior border up to level IV and up to level II while exposing and protecting the accessorius nerve. Exposure of the posterior abdomen of the digastric muscle. Dissection along the digastric muscle and exposure of the submandibular gland. Removal of the capsule in the caudal region. Exposure of the surface of the omohyoid muscle up to its cranial and caudal edge. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection of the same and removal of the soft tissue from medial to lateral and successive development of the neck preparation. Protection of the vagus nerve, the jugular vein and the common carotid artery. Exposure of the bifurcation. Dissection of external carotid artery branches for subsequent anastomosis. Successive development of the neck preparation and hemorrhage-free removal. Protection of the branches of the cervical plexus, which also represents the maximum posterior penetration depth of the neck dissection. At the posterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid, further dissection in depth and exposure of level V, where the neck preparation is also removed here. Neck dissection of the caudal level I b, II, III, IV and proportionally V of the right side. Irrigation with hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Finally, placement of a Redon drain. Repositioning of the patient for tracheostomy. Entry through the previously made apron incision and preparation of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the isthmus of the thyroid gland. Dissection and coagulation of the thyroid and subsequent transection. Individual craniocaudal veins are ligated. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Entering the trachea. Placement of tracheostomy sutures and, in the further course of the operation, finally reintubation with final placement of an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube. Suturing of the transplant by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Multiple sutures must be submitted for this. The upper horn of the thyroid cartilage is resected to gain further access to the defect. First, an attempt is made to preserve the superior laryngeal nerve on the left side, but due to the thickness of the graft it is not possible to insert the entire graft between the pharynx and the superior laryngeal nerve, so this nerve must unfortunately be severed. Then complete suturing of the graft and positioning of the stalk on the right side. For this purpose, the superior thyroid artery is prepared for the arterial connection and the facial vein with an outlet for the venous connections. First start with the arterial anastomosis. Suture with 8.0 Ethilon. This reveals good pedicle perfusion and good venous return. Preparation of the vein. Unfortunately, the suction cup sucks in the pedicle and the entire arterial anastomosis is torn off. The arteries must therefore be shortened on both sides, prepared anew and anastomosed again. Only then can the two veins be couplers with a size 3.5 coupler. Now position the stem again. Fold back the apron flap. Incision of the tracheostoma and two-layer wound closure. A Redon drain was inserted on the left side and a flap on the right side. Continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Doppler control according to the usual procedure, a suture marker was placed on the neck and the flap can also be examined transorally. After receiving the histology, the patient is presented at the tumor conference to plan adjuvant therapy.","Resektion, Neck dissection sowie Tracheotomie

Computed tomography cT3 cN0 cM0. There is now an indication for re-panendoscopy and tumor resection. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.,"After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carry out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Induction of anesthesia and intubation of the patient. After fixation of the tube, the patient is positioned by the surgeon. Start of esophagogastroscopy. Insertion of the endoscope under visualization and constant air insufflation into the stomach. A typical gastric mucosal relief without irritation can be seen on all sides. After entering in inversion, the findings in the area of the gastroesophageal junction are also unremarkable. After desufflation, slow withdrawal of the endoscope with circular inspection of all esophageal sections. The mucosa is unremarkable on all sides. Remove the flexible endoscope. Insert the mouth guard and enter with the small bore tube. Initial inspection of the endolarynx, hypopharynx and esophageal entrance. This reveals normal conditions on all sides. This is followed by inspection of the oral cavity and the oral vestibule. With the exception of the large tonsillar carcinoma on the right side, the findings were otherwise unremarkable, with no evidence of a synchronous second tumor. Removal of the small drainage tube. Insertion of the McIvor oral spatula while protecting the teeth, lips and tongue. Palpatory exploration of the tonsil region. A transoral resection appears possible both by inspection and palpation. Therefore, first incision in the area of the soft palate laterally at the transition to the hard palate. Successive sharp and blunt dissection along the musculature while maintaining the necessary resection distance to the tumor. The resection is carried out taking a large part of the palatoglossus muscle with it. Laterally, the tumor extends into the parapharyngeal soft tissue. A displacement layer remains between the lateral tumor extensions and the external carotid artery. Initially blunt dissection laterally along the displacement layer caudally. Dorsally, the tumor extends to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Here too, resection is performed while maintaining the necessary safety distance. Caudally, the tumor extends to the base of the tongue. The tumor can be resected in sano both by inspection and palpation with the appropriate safety distance. A marginal sample is taken from the glossotonsillar margin to the base of the tongue and a marginal sample from the right parauvular margin. In the meantime, meticulous hemostasis using bipolar coagulation and insertion of H2O2-soaked compresses. During the frozen section by telephone, high-grade dysplasia is seen in the area of the marginal sample from the glossotonsillar to the base of the tongue. Therefore, an appropriate resection is performed here. Repeated hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Due to the extent of the resection, especially laterally to just before the branches of the external carotid artery, a layer of Tachosil is now applied in the area of the lateral wound bed. In addition, the remaining muscles are mobilized and adapted to protect the cervical sheath. Adaptation is performed using Vicryl 3-0 RB1 sutures. As part of the adaptive suturing of the musculature, long-distance coagulation of a slightly larger venous vessel and clipping of a smaller artery is also performed. Both vessels are finally covered extensively in front of the adapted muscle layer. Very good aspect at the end of the operation. Due to the extensive resection area, the decision is made intraoperatively to create a protective tracheostoma. Repositioning of the patient and skin spray disinfection. Infiltration anesthesia. Skin wipe disinfection and sterile draping. Initial palpatory identification and color marking of the thyroid incisura and the level of the cricoid cartilage. Mark the planned incision approx. 1 QF below the level of the cricoid cartilage. Sharply cut through the cutis as well as the subcutis. Dissect the prelaryngeal musculature. Separation of the muscle bellies in the area of the linea alba. Exposure of the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage. Insertion of the retractors. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining the thyroid isthmus using the Péan clamp. Bipolar coagulation of a relatively tender thyroid isthmus and lateralization of the two thyroid lobes. The anterior tracheal wall is now exposed over a large area. Enter between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. First open the trachea. Creation of a visor incision and subsequent tension-free epithelization of the tracheostoma. Subsequently, easy transfer to an 8-gauge high-volume low-pressure tracheostomy tube. The patient can be ventilated easily and adequately via the tracheostomy tube. Application of the cannula tape. Finally, a nasogastric tube is inserted. This is done via the left nostril so that there is no manipulation in the area of the extensive wound bed. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Removal of the oral spatula and completion of the operation without complications.","Tumorresektion, Tracheostomaanlage, Re-Panendo

The preoperative CT of the neck and thorax showed a mass on the uvula on the right anterior palatal arch and extending into the right tonsillar lobe. There were no suspicious lymph nodes and no malignant round foci in the thorax. Thus, the above-mentioned measures were indicated.","After induction of anesthesia and transoral endotracheal intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, positioning of the patient by the surgeon. First of all, placement of the mouth blocker and inspection of the oral cavity. A slightly exophytic, exulcerated mass was found, localized more on the posterior surface of the uvula. On palpation, the left half of the uvula, the cranial part of the anterior and posterior palatal arch and the cranial half of the left tonsil were clearly indurated. Thus, under constant control by means of palpation, the uvula was recut starting from the left upper tonsil pole, with a macroscopic safety margin of 1 cm. Removal of the uvula. Transfer to the right side. Taking the anterior and posterior palatal arch on the right. Constant palpatory control. Careful dissection, macroscopically in healthy tissue. The induration is carefully traced caudally in the right tonsillar lobe. Phases of the constrictor pharyngeus medius muscle are taken. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation. This results in a uvular resection with a tumor tonsillectomy on the right side. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section examination. The pathology colleagues announced their findings by telephone. Tumor cells were found in the cranial part of the specimen, forming a vocal margin. Otherwise, the tumor appeared to be completely removed from the healthy tissue with a minimum distance of 0.1 cm at the level of the middle soft tissue margin (left tonsil lobe). Thus, generous resection cranially, removal of a marginal sample cranially and resection in the former left tonsil lobe in the entire length from cranial to caudal. The three specimens (cranial resection, cranial margin specimen, soft tissue resection margin) are sent for final histology. Careful hemostasis with bipolar coagulation. Careful inspection of the surgical site. Insertion of a gastric tube. Completion of the procedure without bleeding and without complications. Conclusion: Uvular resection with tumor tonsillectomy on the right side. In a cT2 cN0 oral cavity (uvula) - oropharynx (anterior and posterior palatal arch, tonsil) carcinoma. Bilateral neck dissection with PEG placement is planned in 10 days. Taking into account the surgical defect on the uvula and in the area of the right oropharynx, good postoperative swallowing function is to be expected and flap coverage is therefore not necessary.","Transorale TU-Resektion

She had also noticed dysphagia. The external CT scan from <2018> showed a high-grade cT1 cN2b cM0 tonsillar carcinoma on the right side. There is an indication for the above-mentioned operation.,"Transfer of the patient to the operating theater and positioning of the patient. Introductory consultation with the anesthesiologist and performance of the team time-out. With Cormack I, the patient can be intubated without any problems after an unremarkable tracheoscopy. Now start with esophagogastroscopy, here the esophagus and gastric mucosa are non-irritating, inconspicuous and without evidence of bleeding or a mass. Palpation and inspection of the oral cavity. The right tonsil is rough to palpate, especially in the upper area, the left tonsil is palpable without irritation, as is the base of the tongue. Now entering with the Kleinsasser tube C, the vallecula and epiglottis are inconspicuous, as is the base of the tongue; the pharyngeal side and posterior walls as well as the postcricoid region are also inconspicuous. With good adjustability, the larynx can be adjusted up to the anterior commissure, the vocal folds are also inconspicuous, the piriform sinus can be stretched open on both sides without any problems. Now insert the Mc Ivor blade and inspect the tonsil region on the right side. Here an exophytic mass is seen in the upper third of the tonsil, the caudal pole is free and can be luxated without difficulty, the middle of the tonsil and the upper pole can also be luxated without difficulty, but the exophytic mass in the cranial region extends approximately 0.5 cm from the upper tonsil pole to the anterior palatal arch. For this reason, the mucosal incision close to the uvula is made closer to the uvula than in a normal TE and a section of the anterior palatal arch is also resected, so that the tumor is incised by approx. 4 mm. Further careful dissection of the tonsil, the tonsil can be adjusted and luxated without any problems and the fibers can be stretched open and the tonsil separated from the tissue without any problems. The tonsil is not firmly attached to the tonsil bed at either end. Successive detachment of the tonsil without increased coagulation in the upper area to allow inspection of the wound edges. The resection is performed in the remaining area with a minimum distance of 7 mm, in the caudal area now dissection according to the dissection technique with bipolar coagulation and removal of the tonsil. The anterior and posterior palatal arch could be spared. Basally, the tonsil was removed deeper than in normal TE, but without opening the parapharyngeal space. Palpation revealed no further evidence of a mass in the tonsillar lobe. After careful hemostasis with bipolar coagulation, there is no evidence of increased bleeding. Relax for 5 minutes and wait, after reinsertion of the Mc Ivor spatula the wound bed is still dry. End the operation. Inspection of the tonsil. The upper pole in particular is hard to palpate, it is surrounded on all sides by easily movable mucosa, the exophytic mass is also removed by inspection and palpation in healthy tissue. The minimum distance of 4 mm on the anterior palatal arch is approximately 0.5 cm below the cranial pole. Suture marking and sending in the tonsil. Conclusion: cT1 cN2b tonsillar carcinoma on the right side. In today's operation, frozen sections were not performed and the specimen was sent for urgent histology. The histology should be discussed in the interdisciplinary tumor conference, including the performance of the neck dissection. The planning of the further procedure should be discussed.","Tumortonsillektomie rechts, Panendoskopie

Sonographically V.a. cN2c neck status. No evidence of distant metastases on external CT staging. The patient has thrombocytopenia of unknown origin.","Initially after bronchoscopic intubation transnasally via the anesthesia colleagues, start with PEG insertion. For this purpose, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy to see through to the stomach. There are clear signs of chronic gastritis with cobblestone-like changes to the mucosa and petechial bleeding, but no suspicious changes. With excellent diaphanoscopy, the stomach was punctured without any problems and the PEG tube was inserted using the usual thread pull-through method. On reflection, inconspicuous mucosal findings in the area of the oesophagus. After positioning and preparing the patient, a pharyngoscopy is performed. This reveals an exophytic tumor on the right side of the left tonsil region which extends over the anterior palatal arch into the uvula. Soft palate infiltration here at the free edge. Good distance to the hard palate. Complete infiltration of the posterior palatal arch. The posterior pharyngeal wall itself is again tumor-free. At the caudal tonsil pole there is an extension towards the pharyngeal side wall, here the tumor is clearly immobile, in the cranial tonsil area good mobility of the tumor. Insertion of the tonsil plug, good overview below. Transoral resection of the tumor using the monopolar and dissection technique. Select a safety margin of a good 1 ˝ cm, take the uvula with you, enter on the left side, subtotal resection of the soft palate to obtain the safety margin. Now good overview, here no dorsal growth towards the nasopharynx. Good delineation here. Complete resection of the anterior palatal arch. Here the tumor can be safely dissected away with a clear shifting layer to the musculature. Removal of the entire posterior palatal arch, resection up to approx. half of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Resection down to the prevertebral fascia. Now in the direction of the caudal tonsil pole, it can be seen that the tumor clearly extends like a cone towards the neck and the course of the carotid artery. This is confirmed by the CT findings. Therefore, the decision was made to obtain enoral mucosa-covering margin samples and to resect further transcervically. The marginal samples were found to be tumor-free in the frozen section diagnosis. Now turn to the neck dissection on the right side and complete the tumor resection. Skin incision at the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein, an anterior course is ligated and removed. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. A clear lymph node conglomerate can now be seen in Level II to III in the area of the jugulo-facial angle, which is firmly attached and palpable in the direction of the tonsil lobe. In addition, multiple spherical, coarse and caked, highly suspicious nodes are palpable throughout level 5. Expose the accessory nerve and secure the nerve. Now open dissection of the internal jugular vein. Clear the anterior neck preparation while preserving the superior thyroid artery and securing the hypoglossal nerve. The lymph node conglomerate is directly exposed here. First remove the accessorius triangle and level 5, where the lymph node conglomerate is clearly embedded and infiltrated in the cervical plexus. This is now subtotally resected, the lymph node conglomerate extends nuchally directly under the skin. Sharp detachment at the skin with in sano resection. Macroscopically no lymph node openings. Resection up to level 5, ligation and removal of the transverse cervical artery and the very strong accompanying veins. Resection up to the mediastinum, but no further dissection here, no exposure of the subclavian vein, finally no evidence of lymph leakage. The cervical plexus here is subtotally resected, preserved accssorius nerve. Now ligate in the area of the jugulo-facial angle with partial but clear infiltration of the V. facilais and remove the vein. Expose the carotid artery with exit of the superior thyroid artery, the lingual artery extends into the lymph node conglomerate and is questionably infiltrated, this is ligated and removed. Dissection of the hypoglossal nerve, which is clearly adjacent but not infiltrated. Now expose the external carotid artery, after securing the bulb and the outlet of the internal carotid artery. It is now apparent that the cervical lymph node conglomerate is continuously moving in the direction of the tumor, therefore en bloc resection, resection was already performed previously. Now resection of the digastric muscle, resection and connection of the inner and outer resection surfaces in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, passing the external carotid artery, safe removal of the tumor here, now only the carotid artery and the prevertebral fascia remain dorsally. With careful protection of the hypoglossal nerve, resection of the tumor with at least 1 ˝ cm mucosal clearance. Resection extends to the level of the vallecula. This results in an en bloc resection of the tumor with the lymph node conglomerate extending cervically. To assess the tumor in frozen section diagnostics, however, the attached lymph node conglomerate is now removed and specially marked using a ligature. The specimen is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. Except for the deliberately placed margin, tumor-free margins are visible on all sides, so the situation is now R0. Now measure the enoral defect and lift a radialis graft from the left forearm parallel to the neck dissection performed here. After marking the 11 x 6 cm graft, the arm is unwrapped and the tourniquet is placed. Cut around the specimen, take along the cephalic vein and a skin monitor. Exposure of the cephalic vein. Performing the Hayden maneuver and exposing the ramus superficialis nervi radialis and exposing the peripheral vascular pedicle. Ligation of the vascular pedicle. Now careful subpastial preparation with careful protection of the radial nerve branch, free preparation of the graft up to the crook of the elbow. Here the very strong ulnar artery and the relatively slender anterior interosseous artery are secured. Preservation of both vessels. Now expose the wide venous bridge to the superficial venous system. Preservation of the bridge, elevation of a strong cubital venous branch. Reopening of the tourniquet. Regular flap vitality can be seen. Careful wound inspection and hemostasis. Later removal of the graft before insertion with removal of the artery and preservation of the anterior interosseous artery. After hemostasis, careful, two-layer wound closure and incorporation of the full-thickness skin graft lifted from the right groin. Finally, insertion of a vacuum sealing bandage and application of the Cramer splint. For full-thickness skin harvesting, cut around an 11 x 6 cm skin graft in the right groin. Strictly cutaneous elevation of the graft. Careful hemostasis, subcutaneous mobilization of the surrounding tissue and, after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drainage, careful two-layer wound closure and application of a wound dressing. Now first perform the neck dissection on the left side. To do this, also make a skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the external jugular vein and the auricularis magnus nerve. Preservation of the structures. However, the external jugular vein is relatively weak here. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical artery, the superior thyroid artery, the facial vein and the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, free preparation of the internal jugular vein. There are no conspicuous changes at levels 2 to 4, but again at level 5 a partly conglomerate-like, coarse lymph node and macroscopically, palpatorily clearly suspicious, but here without infiltration of the surrounding tissue. Therefore, after evacuation of the accessorius triangle and careful preservation of the nerve, resection of the lymph nodes and preservation of the cervical plexus. Careful caudal inspection. Exposure and preservation of the transverse cervical artery, no evidence of lymphatic leakage caudally and, after careful inspection, wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and careful two-layer wound closure after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. The tracheotomy is now performed due to the resection defect which extends to the hypopharyngeal side wall. For this purpose, a horizontal skin incision of approx. 1 cm below the cricoid cartilage is made. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the intrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Bipolar coagulation of the thyroid isthmus, which is very weak here. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björ flap and successive incision of the tracheostoma with mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequent intubation with an 8 mm Woodbridge tube. At the end of the procedure, reintubation without difficulty onto an 8-gauge cannula, which is fixed with sutures and padded with foam. The graft is now inserted. To do this, pull the graft through from transcervical to transoral. First suture the posterior wall of the soft palate. Knock back the graft and reconstruct the soft palate and suture in the area of the tonsil lobe from the enoral side. Finally, transcervical suturing of the graft in the area of the pharyngeal side wall. Final inspection, good fit and correct measurements. Now positioning of the vascular pedicle. Insertion of the skin monitor. Now conditioning of the graft vessels. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery, which is relatively similar in caliber to the graft artery. Perform the vascular anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon, carefully adapting the vessel diameters. After reopening, good venous return via the graft. With regular graft perfusion to the venous anastomosis, initial conditioning of the external jugular vein, which remains the same caliber after removal due to the metastases of the facial vein. However, the vein is anastomosed over a long distance, even after removal of the thrombus and repeated irrigation, there is no adequate venous return, so this vein is ligated and removed. Now use of a superior thyroid vein trunk suture to the internal jugular vein, peripheral placement after ligation. Measurement of a size 3.5 coupler and problem-free performance of the copupler anastomosis. Immediate regular venous return and, after reopening of the artery, good circulation and regular flap perfusion as well as excellent flap perfusion in the area of the skin monitor and enorally. Careful positioning of the pedicle and partial fixation to the omohyoid muscle is now performed. Now stable conditions in the area of the anastomosis and especially in the area of the venous anastomosis close to the trunk, which is strong and therefore at risk of kinking. Final inspection. Due to the dissection in level 5 of the extended wound cavity, a 10-gauge Redon drain is placed here. There is livid skin discoloration in the area of the direct subcutaneous dissection performed, but the surrounding skin is intact with subcutaneous tissue also present, so no resection is performed here. Careful two-layer wound closure. Multiple vitality checks of the flap and skin monitoring and termination of the procedure at this point. Conclusion: Combined transoral, transcervical resection of a markedly aggressive lymphogenic metastatic cT2 cN2c oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Intraoperative R0 situation due to the intraoperatively extensive and aggressive metastasis, adjuvant RCT is certainly absolutely necessary here due to the atypical metastasis localization, however, a second malignancy should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. Postoperatively, please perform regular flap vitality checks. Post-operative X-ray preeclampsia on the 8th to 9th postoperative day, followed by a swallowing test if the conditions are intact and, if necessary, a diet with decannulation. In the immediate postoperative course, please check the nuchal skin area where there is a potential risk of necrosis. The patient received intraoperative antibiotics with Unacid 3 g and a single dose of SDH 250 mg. No abnormalities regarding the coagulation situation intraoperatively.","Tumorresektion, Neck diss bds., Defektdeckung, Freier Lappen (Radialis), PEG-Anlage

After shortening the vibrissae, hemitransfixion incision on the right and creation of the upper and lower tunnel according to Cottle on the left side. Vertical chondrotomy. Creation of the upper and lower tunnel on the right side. This allows the cartilaginous bony spur, which has deviated markedly to the right, to be adequately exposed and resected. This results in a slit-shaped mucus defect. The middle nasal passage is then exposed by carefully medializing the middle turbinate without fracturing it. Removal of the uncinate process. Creation of a large maxillary sinus window, from which inflammatory swollen mucosa emerges from the ostium. Subsequent clearing of the maxillary sinus with macroscopically typical aspects of fungal sinusitis. Subsequently, extensive rinsing of the maxillary sinus after maximum expansion of the supraturbinal maxillary sinus window. Subsequently, replantation of crushed pieces of cartilage and bone between the dorsal septal mucosal sheets. Fixation of the anterior septal pillar to the anterior nasal spine using sutures. Suturing of the right hemitransfixion incision. Placement and transseptal fixation of septal foils on both sides. Nasal tamponade on both sides, which is mutually fixed in front of the columella. The tracheostomy is then performed. After a skin incision about 2 QF above the jugulum, sharp transection of the cutis, subcutis and subcutaneous fatty tissue with exposure of the linea alba. Dissect the straight neck muscles along the linea alba and expose the thyroid isthmus. Passing under the lamina pretrachealis, pinching off, setting down and repositioning on both sides. This clearly shows the 4 upper tracheal clips. Opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp and completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Easy reintubation of the patient after tube removal. PEG placement (<CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME>). Entry with the gastroesophagoscope under air insufflation. Pre-insufflation into the stomach. After spontaneous diaphanoscopy, insertion of a PEG in the typical manner using the thread pull-through method. Prior to this, perioperative administration of Unacid 3 g. Subsequently, transition to transoral tumor resection. After insertion of the tonsillar blocker with the mouth opening clearly restricted, the entire right tonsil, especially in the caudal area, is resected successively with the ultrasonic knife. The resection begins at the upper tonsil pole parauvularly and encompasses the entire tonsil lobe. The resection is performed caudally along the ascending mandibular branch with a remaining gingiva of about 2-3 mm opposite the molars. Here it becomes clear that the tumor cannot be safely removed from above, especially in the caudal region towards the base of the tongue and the glossotonsillar groove. Therefore, the neck dissection is first performed on the right side. Here, the vascular nerve sheath is exposed after a skin incision. After exposing and dissecting the digastric muscle, the large cystic metastasis is developed from medial to lateral together with the neck dissection specimen. All non-lymphatic structures are spared. After exposing and skeletonizing the accessorius nerve, regions II to V are then completely removed. The submandibular gland and region I are then removed. Dissection of the digastric muscle. This already reveals the defect enorally. The lingual nerve is exposed and can be spared until the end, as can the hypoglossal nerve. After slight widening, the cranially already resected tumor can be moved outwards and the caudal area in the area of the glossotonsillar groove or base of the tongue can finally be removed in toto under visualization. The frozen section histological examination of the specimen shows tumor-free margins on all sides. The minimum distance to the depth is 0.3 cm. For this reason, the remaining tissue on the external carotid artery in the area of the deep margin is also removed retrospectively so that the vascular nerve sheath is exposed cranially and all tissue is removed. This results in a defect measuring approximately 9 x 5 cm. Removal of the radial elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left (<CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME>, PJ): Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery, marking of the flap borders 9.5 x 7.5 cm on the distal forearm proximal to the flexor retinaculum with S-shaped course on the incision proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the stenosis confluence in the cubital fossa, identification of the cephalic vein. Dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial flap graft edge. Identification of the external ramus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion while leaving the peritendinous tissue of the brachioradialis muscle. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendinous tissue on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and probatory clamping with a vascular clamp after 5 minutes under good pulse oximetry measured oxygen saturation, measured on the thumb, the vessels are removed with subsequent lateral thread ligation. Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the pronator quadratus and flexor pollicis longus muscles and bipolar coagulation of the outgoing perforators as well as supply with a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve in the median side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery and the ulnar artery. There is no V. mediana cubiti, only a V. cephalica. First, the radial artery and the 2 accompanying veins are dissected so that they can be connected later and the cephalic vein is cut very far proximally for connection to the jugular vein, later. After exposing the ulnar, brachial and radial arteries, the radial artery is removed while sparing all other vessels. Punctual hemostasis in the area of the wound bed with bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm and the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. The split skin was previously divided three times and lifted. Application of a wound dressing and forearm splint. Completion without complications. Continuation of the operation on the neck with neck dissection of regions II to V on the left side. After insertion of a Redon suction drain, two-layer wound closure. The lifted radialis flap is then sutured into the defect, initially from the transcervical and in the cranial region from the transoval side, and the pedicle is passed outwards. The arterial anastomosis is made to the facial artery, while the venous anastomoses are connected to the internal jugular vein with 2 veins of the flap in an end-to-side manner. After hemostasis, placement of a drain and a Redon suction drain. Two-layer wound closure. Re-intubation of the patient onto an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube. Stable wound dressing. End of the operation. Conclusion: Initially plastic septal correction for septal deviation and ethmoid bone and maxillary sinus surgery on the right side for fungal sinusitis of the right maxillary sinus. Subsequently, combined transoral-transcervical tumor resection of a tonsillar carcinoma on the right side with selective neck dissection of regions I to V on the right and II to V on the left side. Defect coverage with a microvascular anastomosed radial artery flap graft from the left forearm. Arterial anastomosis to the facial artery, venous anastomosis of 2 veins end-to-side to the internal jugular vein on the right side, creation of a plastic tracheostoma, PEG creation, defect coverage on the left forearm with split skin from the right thigh.","Tumorresektion, sel.

Start by inspecting the tonsil. An exophytic mass can be seen in the area of the lower tonsil pole, which merges with the tonsil. The upper tonsil pole is far away from the tumor. Resection of the upper pole of the tonsil begins, which is shown here after preparation of the mucosa of the anterior palatal arch. The tonsil is then released from the upper pole. Dissection is performed down to the pharyngeal muscles. The tonsil is then dissected caudally along the pharyngeal muscles, sparing the posterior palatal arch as much as possible. The tumor is then revealed in the caudal part of the tonsil, so that the preparation plane must then also be moved to the posterior pharyngeal wall. The preparation is also performed at the level of the pharyngeal muscles. The dissection is then carried out up to the transition to the base of the tongue, where the tonsil is then placed far caudally from the tumor. Subsequent subtle hemostasis. Now take marginal samples from the ventral and dorsal as well as basal margin. All of these margin samples are found to be tumor-free in the frozen section intraoperatively. If the wound is dry, all instruments are removed and the surgical robot undocked. After repositioning the patient, injection of local anesthetic and adrenaline in the area of the left side of the neck on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Incision and layer-by-layer dissection in depth. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Further layered dissection in depth and exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Establish the resection margins at the level of the omohyoid muscle and cranially on the digaster muscle. Exposure and sparing of the accessorius nerve. A large metastasis is then seen in the area of the venous angle, which also completely fills the hypoglossal triangle. The neck is then dissected from the posterior edge of the submandibular gland into the hypoglossal triangle. The hypoglossal nerve is exposed and spared together with the cervical profunda. Dissection is then carried out from here via the vein in a lateral direction. In the depth of the hypoglossal triangle, a tiny perforation of the pharynx can be seen, which has occurred here due to the preparation. This perforation is then sutured over twice so that parts of the digaster muscle also cover the perforation well. The cervical vascular sheath is then dissected. Detachment of the lateral neck preparation together with the accessorius triangle while sparing all branches of the cervical plexus on the deep cervical fascia. Then remove the ventral neck preparation. Expose and protect the lymphatic duct in the caudal deposition area. Subsequent subtle hemostasis. The specimen is sent for histopathological examination. Insertion of a Redon drain and then two-layer wound closure. At the end of the procedure, a nasogastric feeding tube is inserted; the patient should be fed via this tube for 5 days postoperatively. The procedure was then completed and the patient was transferred to the ENT intensive care unit after the recovery phase.","TORS: Tonsillektomie, Neck dissection

Prior to the operation, the patient underwent galvanotherapy, which is one of the alternative healing methods. This resulted in massive burning of the skin.","Initial inspection of the tonsil region. The tonsils are very small on both sides and rather unremarkable from a macroscopic point of view. A tumor tonsillectomy was performed on the left side due to an abnormal PET-CT finding. Incision of the anterior palatal arch and dissection of the tonsil with removal of some musculature under bipolar coagulation, then sending the tonsil marked with a thread for frozen section. Unfortunately, the pathologist found carcinoma in situ in the area of the anterior palatal arch and medially. These areas will be resected. A large resection is performed on the anterior palatal arch in the mucosal area and also on the posterior palatal arch in the mucosal area and then marginal samples are taken in each case. However, the new marginal samples are then free of tumor and carcinoma in situ. In the meantime, a PEG was performed using the thread pull-through method with <CLINICIAN_NAME> without any problems. Rearrangement for neck dissection, as already mentioned the skin looks very burnt. It almost has the aspect of postradiation skin. A skin incision is made at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Palpation reveals a very thick, large mass that already occupies a large part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. After the skin incision, dissection is extremely difficult as the tissue is sulfurously inflamed, which is due to galvanotherapy. You have to fight your way through thick scar plates and through tissue that bleeds very easily. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is exposed first in the lower and then in the very upper area. A platysmal flap is formed in the posterior and anterior region. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is first released laterally, then an attempt to release it with the laser is unsuccessful. The internal jugular vein is pulled completely into the metastasis, it is ligated above and below and then removed. The internal carotid artery and the vagus nerve can be spared, as can the coronary artery. Then remove the entire neck specimen after separating the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the upper and lower area so that the entire neck specimen can be removed en bloc with thick caked metastases. Intraoperative demonstration on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>, demonstrating that the metastasis runs directly through the cervical plexus and could not be detached from it. The plexus branches are therefore also removed. Then hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation and irrigation. During dissection, the lingual artery is torn and must be ligated. If a very radical approach is required, the neck dissection on the opposite side is initially omitted. The oral cavity and oropharynx are then inspected again. A relatively large defect can be seen laterally, where neck fat also emerges at one point. A mucosal flap is therefore formed with the posterior palatal arch to minimize bleeding and the risk of fistula. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit.","Tonsillektomie, Neck dissection

An additional suspicious focus in the right vallecula area could be excluded with regard to malignancy by biopsy during the pre-panendoscopy. Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery is now indicated. There is cN2b status on the right.","Initial consultation with the anesthesiologist. First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The described tumor is seen in the area of the palatal arch extending to the left side, just to the tonsillar lobe, on the right side transition to the tonsillar lobe or oropharyngeal side wall and growth caudally to the border to the base of the tongue. Inspection of the right vallecula again. No tumor here. Performing the PEG insertion: insertion of the esophagoscope into the stomach. After creating the diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Sterile dressing. Therefore now transoral tumor resection. The tumor is resected on all sides with a safety margin of 1-1.5 cm. The entire palatal arch, including the upper tonsillar lobe, the tonsillar lobe and parts of the oropharyngeal side wall on the right, including the wall in the deeper muscular area, are resected up to the base of the tongue, which is only resected at the edges, or up to the entrance of the hypopharynx. The specimen is removed and thread-marked, both at the edges of the mucosa and basally. In addition, a marginal sample is taken from the left in the area of the palatal arch and adjacent to the tonsillar lobe as well as caudally on the right at the border to the hypopharynx. Both the margins of the specimen and the edge samples are tumor-free. Thus R0 situation. Repositioning of the patient. Abjoding. Injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. Sterile draping of all relevant surgical areas. Start with the neck dissection on the right: skin incision curved in the typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the digastric and omohyoid muscles. Detachment of the fat lymph node package from the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein and external jugular vein. Exposure of the internal carotid artery, external carotid artery. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery, facial artery and lingual artery. Exposure, displacement and at the end of the operation re-embedding, in the sense of neurolysis, of the following nerves: hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and the branches of the cervical plexus. Overall clearing level II to V. Several definite or at least probably malignant lymph nodes cranially in level II to III. Careful irrigation and hemostasis. Transition to neck dissection on the left: This is performed in the same way as on the right side. Level II to IV evacuation is performed, exposing the structures also described on the right, as well as exposure, relocation and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the following nerves: hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and the branches of the cervical plexus. Then tracheostoma creation: small Kocher collar incision. Exposure of the subcutaneous tissue up to the infrahyoid musculature. This is split. The thyroid isthmus is passed underneath, clamped, severed and ligated using puncture ligatures. The trachea is then exposed. Exposure of a small, wide-stalked, modified Björ flap and epithelialization of the same. Re-intubation. Subsequent elevation of the radial flap: marking of the required flap dimension after measurement. Length 10.5 cm, maximum width 6- 6.5 cm. Mark the flap in the left forearm area with the central radial artery. First cut around the flap ulnarly, subfascially. Then extend the incision into the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the pedicle under the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the superficial venous system with connection between the superficial and deep venous system. Subsequent radial incision of the flap and subfascial detachment. Exposure of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. The radial artery is exposed caudally and initially clamped. After constant saturation between 95 and 100% for at least 15 minutes, the artery is severed and sutured proximally and distally using 4.0 Prolene stitches. The flap is then removed. Outgoing small vessels are treated bipolar or with clips. Dissection up to the crook of the elbow. Two outlets in the area of the cephalic vein and a smaller outlet in the area of the confluence can be dissected. Before exposing the radial artery, the interosseous artery is cut and clipped after prior clamping. The flap is then removed. Ligation in the area of the proximal venous stumps. The stump of the radial artery is treated at the entrance to the brachial artery by means of stitches above and below 6.0 Vascufil. Careful hemostasis and irrigation in the forearm area. Primary closure of the skin up to the defect. Defect is closed with split skin. This is removed from the thigh area using a dermatome and successively incorporated into the forearm defect. Subsequent application of Mepilex dressing, loose swab dressing. Wrapping with absorbent cotton. Fitting of a Cramer splint and wrapping with an elastic bandage. Attachment of the arm. Thigh area is treated with hydrocolloid dressing. After application, the hand always shows no signs of saturation and no signs of reduced circulation. Removal of the flap: After removal, the flap was already rinsed with heparin. Creation of a tunnel through the residual pharyngeal wall. This is at least 2 transverse fingers wide. Careful hemostasis here. Pass the stalk outwards into the soft tissues of the neck. The flap is sutured in successively, partly from the outside, through sutures placed in front, partly transorally. The defect can be completely closed without tension. The flap is sutured dorsally and ventrally to the remains of the palatal arch and folded. Then vascular anastomosis. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery. This can be dissected quite close to the exit from the externa in the appropriate size. The arteries are anastomosed using 9.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. A portion of the facial vein and the external jugular vein are conditioned for the venous anastomosis. A branch of the cephalic vein is anastomosed with the external jugular vein using a coupler, post-conditioning of the veins. A 2.5 mm coupler is used. After opening the clamps, there is good venous flow. Positive smear phenomenon. The other outlet of the cephalic vein is then anastomosed with the outlet from the facial vein, also using a 2.5 m coupler after prior conditioning of the vessels. Good venous return here too, positive smear phenomenon. The small outlet in the confluence area is closed with two clips. Careful irrigation and hemostasis. The wound is closed by inserting two flaps on the right side, whereby the stalk shows a visible protrusion in the area of the middle of the skin suture. Nevertheless, marking of the site for Doppler control using Vicryl suture. The left side had already been closed in layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. Here, too, careful hemostasis and irrigation were performed beforehand. Application of a pressure bandage on the right and left. The tracheal cannula is then fixed with sutures. Intraoral inspection of the flap again. This is well supplied with blood. Completion of the procedure without complications. Final consultation with the anesthetist. The patient goes to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Please continue the intraoperative antibiotic treatment with Unacid for one week. Please carry out clinical checks and Doppler checks on vitality and blood flow in the radial lobe for 5 days. Heparin 500 units/hour was started intraoperatively and should be continued for a total of 5 days. Please feed for 7-10 days via the inserted PEG tube. Food build-up according to clinical findings, if necessary after swallowing porridge. After receiving the final histology, please attend the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Resektion, Neck diss. bds., PEG-Anlage, Tracheotomie, Defektdeckung, Freier Lappen (Radialis)

A preoperative palpation examination prior to surgery was therefore not possible.,"Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, then insertion of the spandex and a covered retractor and inspection and palpation of the tumor region. On inspection, the tumor appears relatively superficial, but on palpation the tumor extends to the midline into the tongue muscles and also into the deep tongue muscles. Intraoperative consultation of <CLINICIAN_NAME> and demonstration of the findings. It became clear that defect coverage using a free transpalantate would be necessary after the tumor resection, so it was decided to perform only the tumor resection on this day and to perform defect coverage using a free radialis graft and neck dissection in a two-stage procedure. Unfortunately, preoperative planning in this regard was not possible due to the patient's lack of compliance. The diode laser was initially set to 20 watts and the tumor region was first cut around the upper edge of the tongue. In the course of the operation, the wattage must be increased to 30. The tumor is partially resected using a monopolar needle. Ultimately, the tumor is completely removed with a safety margin of 1 cm. The entire specimen is placed on cork for frozen section, all margins including the deep margins are free of carcinoma. There is still carcinoma in situ at the margin of the floor of the mouth, so a resection is taken here and a margin sample is taken again for frozen section. All margins are definitively R0. Higher grade dysplasia at the dorsal margin in the floor of the mouth, therefore a resection is taken here and a margin sample is taken, which is finally sent for histology without a frozen section. Overall, all margins R0 in the frozen section. Hemostasis with bipolar coagulation and completion of the procedure without complications. Please plan graft coverage without delay using a radialis graft and neck dissection. A day point must be reserved for this. In this case, it is also possible to perform the operation on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Friday if the pre-reserved flap appointments are already taken. The surgeon repositions the patient for the tracheotomy in the head reclination position. Injection of Suprarenin below the cricoid cartilage (8 ml). Sterile abjodation and draping of the patient. Skin incision 1/2 cm below the cricoid cartilage (horizontal). Bipolar coagulation of the superficial veins. Spreading dissection of the infrahyal musculature and vertical incision. The infrahyal musculature is pushed laterally on both sides and the cricoid cartilage is exposed. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus and undermining of the thyroid isthmus with a clamp. Bipolar coagulation of the isthmus and gradual sharp transection. Push the thyroid flaps away from the trachea and bipolar coagulation until the wound is completely dry. Identification of the incision site between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Sharp incision of the trachea after saturation of the patient. Visor tracheotomy. Suturing of the tracheostoma first at the lower, then at the upper part in the sense of an epithelialized tracheostoma. Removal of the tube and insertion of an 8 mm tracheostomy tube.

Pathohistologically only verrucous leukoplakia, whereby a highly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma could not be excluded. Based on the clinical findings, however, a cT2 glottic laryngeal carcinoma of the left side must be assumed. Due to the lack of adjustability during the initial operation, there is now an indication for a partial laryngectomy from the outside. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carry out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. Orotracheal intubation by the anesthesia colleagues using GlideScope optics. Fixation of the tube. Positioning of the patient in head reclination. Skin spray disinfection and infiltration anesthesia. Skin wipe disinfection and sterile draping.

Using the wheel, the larynx is now opened in the median line in the sense of a thyrofissure. Opening of the endolarynx in the median line. Insertion of the small retractor. An extensive, verrucous, tumorous process can now be seen, which encompasses the entire left vocal fold. The tumorous formation extends caudally into the subglottic appendix. Cranially, the tumor grows into the Morgagnian ventricle. The anterior commissure appears clinically tumor-free. Dorsally, the tumor growth extends at least as far as the vocal process. Circular resection of the tumor is now performed while maintaining the corresponding resection margins. In the ventral, cranial and caudal areas, the tumour can be mobilized relatively easily. Here, the resection is carried out with the vocalis muscle. In the dorsal parts, resection is somewhat more difficult. After appropriate oxygenation of the patient, the tube is retracted to ensure a better overview. The tumor is now removed in toto, taking the vocal process with it. Circular margin samples are taken and sent for frozen section diagnostics. In the area of the superior/posterior margin, i.e. in the area of the arys, there are still extensions of a carcinoma in situ. Therefore, the first step is to take the corresponding resected specimens and new margin samples in the two localizations mentioned above (superior/posterior and left arytenoid). As part of the intraoperative frozen section diagnostics, the second margin samples are evaluated as tumor-free. Only moderate dysplasia is detected here, with no evidence of carcinoma in situ. Meticulous hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Creation of a total of four drill holes in the area of the thyroid cartilage. Removal of the retractor. Adaptation of the thyroid cartilage in the median line using PDS 4.0. Stitching over the incision in the area of the ligamentum conicum. Suturing of the previously prepared perichondrium flap.

There is now an indication for panendoscopy and tumor resection for squamous cell carcinoma that has already been histologically confirmed externally and for PEG placement. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.","After team time out and active patient identification, anesthesia is induced by the anesthesia colleagues. Transition to tracheoscopy: insertion with the rigid endoscope and smooth passage of the non-irritated glottis. Entry after endotracheal. Mucosal conditions are normal on all sides up to the tracheal bifurcation. Intubation is then performed by the surgeon. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon and insertion of the mouth guard. Entry with the size C small bore tube. Adjustment of the endolarynx. The mucosal conditions in the glottis and supraglottis area are inconspicuous on all sides. Adjustment of the anterior and posterior commissure. Here, too, there is no evidence of a tumor. Subsequent inspection of the piriform sinus on both sides. This is lined on both sides by smooth mucosa on all sides and can be freely unfolded up to the tip of the piriform sinus. Mucosal conditions in the area of the esophageal entrance and postcricoid are also unremarkable. Subsequent inspection of the vallecula and the base of the tongue. Here, too, there is no evidence of a tumor. Then insertion of the McIvor oral spatula and inspection of the oral cavity and epipharynx. Here the previously described tumorous mass in the area of the uvula base can be seen. This extends to the left paramedian side onto the anterior palatal arch. The suspicious mucosa also extends slightly to the paramedian right on the right side. Raise the uvula and inspect the posterior surface of the uvula. Suspicious, uneven mucosal conditions can also be seen here. These extend from the tip of the uvula beyond the base of the uvula to the posterior surface of the soft palate. Then mark the resection margins with the electric needle. A safety distance of at least 5 mm is maintained in all planes. Resection of the tumor under vision. In the area of the posterior surface of the soft palate, it can now be seen that the suspicious mucosal change extends relatively far cranially. The suspicious area is therefore resected under visualization. The tumor resectate is sent en bloc for frozen section diagnostics. A marginal sample is also taken in the area of the cranial soft palate posterior surface. This is also sent for frozen section diagnostics. As part of the frozen section diagnosis by telephone, questionable marginal carcinoma in situ in the area of the cranial resection surface of the back of the soft palate. Therefore, a representative resection specimen and 2 margin specimens were taken, some of which were sent in for definitive histology. Clinically macroscopically, a clear R0 resection is now present. Finally, esophagogastroscopy and PEG insertion are performed. Insertion of the endoscope under visualization and constant air insufflation into the stomach. This reveals a typical, inconspicuous gastric mucosal relief on all sides. Entering in inversion. Inspection of the gastroesophageal junction. This also appears normal and without irritation. The PEG is then inserted in the typical manner using the thread pull-through method and positive diaphanoscopy. At the end of the operation, final inspection of the enoral resection area. Repeated meticulous hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Intraoperative demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Completion of the operation without complications. Conclusion: Clinical macroscopic R0 resection of a cT1 cN1 uvular carcinoma.

Due to the tumor volume, the above-mentioned intervention is indicated.","First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The tumor is found with ulceration in the area of the tonsil lobe, transition to the base of the tongue. Tumor is not very mobile and shows deep infiltration. As already recognizable in the pre-ultrasound or CT. Now sterile draping, injection of a total of 15 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. Start with transoral resection: Cut around the inside of the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm to 2 cm on all sides. The tumor can be well dissected in the dorsal area up to the .................. musculature. Marginal samples are taken from the palatal arch, from the palatal arch extending laterally to the alveolar ridge, from the alveolar ridge extending to the middle of the tongue body, from the base of the tongue and from the posterior palatal arch area and the upper two thirds of the posterior wall of the hypopharynx. Tissue is also removed from the basal area directly above the tonsil lobe up to the per................. Musculature, which is sent in as cranial basal medial. All marginal samples are tumor-free in the frozen section. PEG insertion: advancement of the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach, where ............. diaphanoscopy is performed in a typical manner. Insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube. Fixation to the abdominal wall. Sterile dressing. Now continue the tumor resection from the outside: skin incision as for neck dissection. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. A large tumor conglomerate can be seen cranially. This infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein, the accessorius nerve and also grows into the external carotid artery. Cranial and caudal insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The internal jugular vein is also removed cranially and caudally and ligated twice. The cranial operation shows that the tumor can be easily dissected from the caudal edge of the parotid gland. Subsequently, touched tissue with suspected tumor infiltration is seen in the area of the digastric muscle. All muscles of the ............... fan are also resected, as is the submandibular gland. The hypoglossal nerve is clearly infiltrated by the tumor and is also resected. Further medial dissection shows that the tumor of the internal carotid artery can be dissected. The vagus nerve appears to be infiltrated. A marginal sample is taken, which shows clear tumor infiltrates. Resection of the vagus nerve and also the border cord, which is also involved in the tumor conglomerate. Separation of the carotid artery above the superior thyroid artery and suturing of this. Further branches of the lingual artery and facial artery and other smaller branches of the external carotid artery are included in the tumor preparation. Cranially, the external carotid artery is also ligated twice below the entrance to the parotid gland, as caudally. It can be seen that the tumor is growing from the pharyngeal wall towards the N3 metastases, as already visible in the imaging. Here the tumor is incised and dissected so that the neck preparation can be pushed off to the side. When the neck dissection is continued, level V a is massively interspersed with hardened lymph nodes, which indicate tumor infiltration. This means that almost all branches of the cervical plexus are resected as well as parts of the deep neck muscles. Resection extends caudally up to the venous angle. Level V b is also resected. The final result is an extended radical neck dissection. The part that grows per continuitatem in the direction of the tumor is marked with a suture. The tumor resection is then continued. All soft tissue structures are removed except for the internal carotid artery, including the parts of the masticatory muscles medial to the mandible. Resection extends basally to the prevertebral musculature. Middle area Adherence of the tumor to the musculature. This is partially resected as well. The resection also reveals massive retropharyngeal lymph nodes, which are thickened and appear to be infiltrated by the tumor. All lymph nodes are resected. The resection extends cranially to the entry of the carotid artery into the base of the skull. A cuff of 1 cm around the carotid artery remains suspicious for tumor. From all soft tissue in the area of the cranial ............... muscles and also from the suspicious cuff around the carotid artery. This is also sent to the frozen section as a cranial basal lateral sample. A marginal sample is also taken from the middle area, from the area of the prevertebral musculature, which is sent as medial basal. Continue the resection in the caudal direction. Here it extends to the piriform sinus entrance and includes parts of the arytenoid fold. A caudal basal margin sample is taken from the deep soft tissue. Mucosal margin samples are also taken from the piriform sinus and from the lower part of the hypopharynx up to the arytenoid region. All mucosal margin samples are healthy. The caudal basal margin sample is also healthy. Tumor infiltrate is visible in the medial basal margin specimen. Extensive resection of the prevertebral soft tissues is performed and another margin sample is taken. The cranial basal lateral margin specimen is not healthy, but broadly infiltrated by tumor. Extensive resection around the carotid artery is also performed here. However, the tissue quality does not change, so that tumor infiltration can be assumed here. Another marginal sample is taken. The marginal sample from the central area is negative, but there are still extensive tumor infiltrates from the marginal sample in the cuff around the internal carotid artery, which had now been visualized until shortly before entering the base of the skull. Laterally, .......... Due to the massive infiltration, which is also visible macroscopically, there is now an R2 situation at the base of the skull. Continuation is not possible without endangering the patient's life due to the massive infiltration. Therefore, wide coagulation of the tissue. Neck dissection is now performed on the right side: visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid and digastric muscles. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, common carotid artery, internal and external carotid artery, internal jugular vein and facial vein. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery and also the lingual and facial arteries. Careful attention is paid to the preservation of the arteries. Also visualization of the external jugular artery. Several .............. lymph nodes are now also removed during level II to V evacuation. The submandibular gland is also removed on this side in order to gain the facial artery for insertion of the flap. The accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve can be exposed and preserved. Subsequently, tracheotomy in the typical manner and epithelialization of the cartilage to the neck skin after entering the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. A small tracheostoma is created. Subsequently, the radialis flap is removed to cover the defect: the size of the defect is carefully measured in three dimensions and recorded on the forearm. Also recording a skin......... Successive lifting of the flap with skin........... First .............subfascial, then from radial. The radialis is ligated and treated using 4.0 Prolene sutures. All outgoing vessels are treated with ligatures or clips. The superficial and deep venous system is removed and exposed in the antecubital region, where it is exposed cranial to the cephalic vein and also a ............. of the radial vein. The radial artery is removed shortly before the exit of the interosseous artery. The stump is supplied with 4.0 Prolene. The veins are removed and the flap preparation is flushed with heparin. The veins are treated with ligatures. The procedure was performed under tourniquet. After opening the tourniquet, the flap reperfused well. Careful hemostasis in the area of the forearm skin. The cranial area is closed in layers. Defect is covered with split skin from the thigh. This was removed with a dermatome. Split skin with a thickness of 0.7 mm was obtained. This is successively incorporated into the defect, resulting in complete defect coverage. The thigh wound is treated with a hydrogel-Mepilex dressing. The forearm wound is treated with a Mepilex and hydrogel Lavanid dressing. Then wrap in absorbent cotton and apply a forearm splint using an elastic bandage. Repositioning of the arm splint. Due to the vascular situation on the left side, a tunnel is now created to the right side of the neck across the prelaryngeal muscles. This is three transverse fingers wide. The radialis flap is successively sutured into the defect using 3.0 Vicryl single-button sutures, whereby the overview is sometimes difficult. Tension-free suturing and complete coverage of the three-dimensional defect is achieved. The flap stalk is passed through the tunnel to the right side. Veins and arteries are conditioned here. The flap is sutured to the facial artery using 8.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. Good venous return after opening the clamps. The ..................................... veins are sutured between the cephalic vein and a branch of the facial vein using the 3.5 coupler system. After opening the clamps, good venous return............. ...... positive. The confluence of the radial artery is closed with clips. The stump of the outlet of the facial vein is also closed using clips and ligature. Subsequent irrigation of the entire wound area as well as shortly after completion of the tumor resection and careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers on both sides of the neck with the insertion of a Redon drain. The skin monitor is sutured into place via a separate skin incision on the right paramedian side due to the course of the stalk in the anterior neck area. An 8-gauge cannula with a core is inserted and sutured in place. Once again the flap from transoral, good blood circulation. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics with Unacid for one week, as well as administration of heparin via perfusor 500 units per hour for 5 days. Flap control according to the scheme for 5 days. Feeding via the inserted PEG for 10 - 12 days. Then X-ray pre-swallow and, if necessary, diet build-up. Considerable dysphagia is to be expected with the extension of the resection, therefore early initiation of swallowing rehabilitation, including presentation to the voice and speech department.","transcervicale Tumorresektion mit erweiterter radikaler Neck dissection, Lappendeckung (Radialis)

For this, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. Here, with good diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and subsequent placement of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. Regular esophagus on reflection. Inspection and palpation are now performed. There is a coarse tumor limited to the left tonsil, but with a clearly submucosal part. Exposure with the tonsil retractor. Mucosal incision as for tumor tonsillectomy. It quickly becomes apparent that the tumor clearly infiltrates the muscles of the posterior palatal arch submucosally. After removal of the anterior palatal arch, the tumor can be seen growing in depth per continuitatem into the soft tissues of the neck and on cervical palpation with direct adhesion to the lymph node metastasis. Complete detachment from the mucosal level, this is covered with marginal samples, which are later classified as tumor-free. Now repositioning for neck dissection of the left side. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline, cutting of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. It is palpable that the metastasis in the upper part infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Visualization of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. This shows that the posterior venter is also infiltrated. Therefore, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is now exposed caudally. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. This shows that it is completely infiltrated and occluded from approx. level III, therefore the vein is removed caudally. Exposure of the common carotid artery and vagus nerve en bloc. Dissection of the markedly hard metastasis which firmly infiltrates the surrounding area, taking level V with it. The cervical plexus must be taken subtotally. Cranially, the metastasis can be seen growing ever closer to the spinal column. In the area of the spine, the metastasis can be resected in sano, taking the musculature with it. Extirpation of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Removal of the muscular pharyngeal side wall and thus resection of the tumor with the ..............., which is located directly at the metastasis as described above. Resection with absolute infiltration of the hypoglossal nerve. After complete removal, it is now clear that the tumor surrounds the carotid bulb as well as the external and internal carotid arteries by almost 360°. After visualization, there is a clear infiltration of the carotid bulb and the internal carotid artery. Now add <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Confirmation of the findings. The tumor is now debulked as far as possible. Deposition of the external carotid artery close to the bulb. The internal carotid artery can now be freed from the tumor over a long distance. In the case of bulbar infiltration, extremely vulnerable conditions, new vascular suture required here, therefore no further measures here so that an overall R2 situation remains at the carotid bulb after complete resection. Due to the overall situation, the indication for defect coverage and vascular protection using a pectoralis major flap is now given. Lifting of the pectoralis major flap (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): First draw in the deltopectoral flap and the skin island. The skin island is 8 x 10 cm in size. In consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, cut around the skin island, then cut through a very thick layer of fat. Dissection down to the musculature. Then removal of the pectoralis major muscle from the chest wall, partly sharp, partly blunt. Blunt exposure of the pectoralis minor muscle and exposure of the vascular pedicle. This is successful without any problems. Then create a tunnel in the area of the deltopectoral flap while protecting the fascia of the pectoralis major muscle. Then cut through the pectoralis major muscle lateral and medial to the vascular pedicle. This must be done as far up as possible, as the flap must extend into the tonsil region and the defect is relatively large and there is also a large subcutaneous fat layer. Sutures are then placed in the caudal region. Pulling through the pectoralis major flap and fixation in the cranial region from the enoral side. The remaining suture fixation from transcervical. The flap was vital and supplied with blood until the end of the operation. Redon drains were then inserted and the skin was sutured in 2 or 3 layers, also in the chest area. Unfortunately, the wound in the neck area cannot be completely closed, as otherwise pressure would have to be applied to the vascular pedicle. Therefore, full-thickness skin was removed from the excess skin on the breast, meshed and covered the open defect with meshed full-thickness skin.

Also maintain a safe distance in the direction of the morgnoid sinus. The tumor reaches close to the vocal process, but certainly does not infiltrate the posterior commissure. Dissection is now performed on the anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage. Exposure of the vocal process. The tumor can then be deposited dorsally with a tiny portion of the vocal process at a safety distance of about 2 mm. Inspection of the specimen. This is then thread-marinated. A fringe of healthy tissue can be seen all around the tumor. The specimen is sent to the frozen section marked with a thread. All the margins are marked as tumor-free. The safety margin towards the perichondrium is sometimes less than 1 mm. For this reason, a piece of perichondrium in the dorsal section of the resection area is removed again and sent separately for final histological assessment and confirmation of the R0 situation. Perform subtle hemostasis. Mobilization of the pocket fold on the right side. For this purpose, an incision is made above the pocket fold at approximately the level of the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage.

Positioning of the patient and insertion of the mouth guard. An exophytic tumor can be seen, which particularly involves the tonsil on the left side in the area of the middle and lower half of the tonsil and extends to the base of the tongue. The resection begins parauvularly in the area of the anterior and posterior palatal arch. Here resection with the electric needle. Care is taken to ensure a sufficient safety distance of more than 5 mm. The resection is carried out from the cranial to the lateral, into the pharyngeal muscles. Further resection is carried out strictly along the pharyngeal musculature, which in some cases only forms a wafer-thin bridge into the parapharyngeal space. Several larger vascular inflows are partially coagulated here, but also partially cut off. The resection continues towards the caudal tonsil pole. Further dissection along the pharyngeal musculature. It can now be seen that the tumor clearly extends to the base of the tongue. Therefore, the tumor is finally resected macroscopically in toto with a large portion of the base of the tongue. Careful hemostasis. The specimen is thread-marked for histopathological evaluation. In the meantime, a radical neck dissection of the left side of the neck is performed. This was possible due to the continuous musculature of the pharynx, which, although only partially very thin, could be preserved in continuity. The intraoperative frozen section revealed that although the margin of the base of the tongue was R0, it appeared to be very narrow. Therefore, after performing the neck dissection, an additional resection was performed in the area of the base of the tongue. This was performed without any problems. Subtle hemostasis was performed again so that the wound was sufficiently dry at the end of the operation. Neck dissection on the left. Skin incision curved in the typical manner, just below the tip of the mastoid to the level of the omohyoid muscle. Dissection of subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and exposure of the digastric muscle. A large tumor conglomerate is visible, which is fixed to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and can be mobilized by partially removing the muscle. First visualization of the facial vein, which is ligated. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. The tumor node can be dissected from the jugular vein below it. Exposure of the internal and external carotid arteries and the superior thyroid artery. Exposure, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the following nerves: vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve, cervical nerve. The accessorius nerve in particular is firmly fused to the tumor conglomerate and can be detached with difficulty, but preserved. All branches of the cervical plexus are also exposed and preserved. The capsule of the submandibular gland was removed caudally. The overall result is an evacuation of levels II to V. Apart from the clear malignancy of the lymph node conglomerate, there are still some lymph nodes in the specimen that appear to be suspicious. Finally, careful irrigation and hemostasis.

After intubation with the anesthesia colleagues, the Kleinsasser tube was inserted after an unremarkable tracheoscopy and inspection of the findings. There was a relatively small finding of the left palatine tonsil, consistent with a cT2 extension; the lateral left base of the tongue also appeared to be infiltrated. Demonstration of the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME> and planning of the procedure.","Now insertion of the tonsil blocker and then start with the tumor resection. The tonsil carcinoma is cut around cranially in the healthy tissue with the electric needle and separated laterally up to the alveolar ridge. The tumor specimen is now developed and removed from the cranial to the caudal side in a plane that is easy to move in the area of the musculature. The lateral base of the tongue is also resected caudally. In between, bipolar hemostasis and removal of the tumor specimen en bloc. In between, the findings were demonstrated intraoperatively on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The tumor is thread-marked for frozen section. During the operation, it was found that the tumor was still interspersed with carcinoma in situ or severe dysplasia caudally in the area of the base of the tongue and in the area of the anterior palatal arch and the glossotonsillar groove. The decision was therefore made to perform a resection. A large piece of mucosa is resected in the area of the glossotonsillar groove in the anterior palatal arch. This is cut to such an extent that part of the submandibular gland is exposed enorally. A large section of the base of the tongue is resected caudally so that the epiglottis is completely visible on the left side. Now a flat piece from the tonsillar loge is resected in toto again to counter the dysplasia described above in the area of the upper anterior palatal arch and transitioning to the posterior pharyngeal wall. These specimens are also sent to the frozen section marked with a thread. Bipolar blood is then stopped. This frozen section is then only found to be interspersed with dysplasia in the area of the base of the tongue. After consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, a further section is cut here, which is sent for final histological assessment. Bipolar blood is now meticulously stopped and hydrogen swabs are inserted. Transfer for neck dissection on the right: instillation of 10 ml xylocaine with adrenaline in the area of the sternocleidomastoid margin. Skin incision, cutting of the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Ligation of the external jugular vein and removal. Expose the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid, the accessorius nerve, the cervical vascular nerve sheath and the omohyoid muscle. The cervical vascular nerve sheath is now exposed in the sense of the internal jugular vein, common carotid artery and vagus nerve. The posterior neck preparation is then successively removed from the upper accessorius triangle and completely removed while sparing the plexus branches and the accessorius nerve. Nodes suspicious of metastases are noted in level IIb. The anterior neck dissection is then completed by removal of the capsule of the submandibular gland, visualization of the hypoglossal nerve and three operations in the anterior triangle of the neck. Minor bleeding is coagulated. This is followed by hydrogen and ring irrigation, hemostasis and insertion of a Redon drain. The wound is then closed in two layers if the wound is dry. Now repositioning for tracheotomy: modified Kocher collar incision, cutting of the subcutaneous tissue and displacement of the prelaryngeal veins. Now expose the thyroid isthmus and undermine it. Ligature and weaning. Creation of a Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner without complications. An 8-bore tracheostoma is inserted. The patient receives 250 mg SDH and 5 mega penicillin i.v. and is admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Finally, a nasogastric feeding tube was inserted. Conclusion: cT3 cN2c tonsillar carcinoma on the left. Neck dissection on the left side should be performed in about 14 days with an extensive enoral wound cavity.","Tumorresektion, Neck Diss. rechts, Tracheotomie

On CT, the tumor extends from the entrance to the nasopharynx to the hypopharyngeal junction. Laterally, per-continuitatem growth, at least in the sonography mandibular infiltration not described. Preoperative vascular evaluation shows infiltration of the externa in the upper area. In the lower area 2 to 3 free outlets.","First pharyngoscopy: The described tumor is seen, which occupies almost the entire palatal arch and extends caudally into the entire oropharyngeal side wall, growing into the base of the tongue. Hypopharynx: Lateral mucosal findings are clear. Therefore surgery with flap coverage confirmed. First injection of a total of 20 ml xylocaine 1% with adrenaline in the area of both sides of the throat. Then sterile draping. Start with tracheostoma creation: A small Kocher collar incision is made. Subsequent division of the infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped off and then supplied with a puncture ligature. Exposure of the trachea. Entering the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Creation of a broad-based modified Björk flap. This is epithelialized. Insertion of a spiral tube. Subsequently combined transoral, transcervical tumor surgery and extended radical neck dissection on the left: First insertion of the McIvor mouth spatula and the mouth retractors in alternation and placement of a tongue retaining suture. The tumor is cut around on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm. The entire palatal arch and anterior and posterior wall areas are removed. Resection extends over the alveolar ridge down to the base of the tongue. The floor of the mouth is incised forwards. The posterior half of the tongue body with the base of the tongue is resected close to the raphe. Marginal samples are taken from the entire palatal arch area, including the anterior and posterior wall, from the mucosa above the alveolar ridge, from the floor of the mouth in front, from the body of the tongue and from the base of the tongue. These are all tumor-free in the frozen section and have so far been R0 resected. The neck is then opened with a submandibular curved incision, which is extended caudally. It can be seen that the tumor has infiltrated the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extends cranially towards the base of the skull. There is also evidence of per-continuitatem growth of the tumor laterally to the uppermost lymph node stations. The external carotid artery can be dissected freely and is not infiltrated by the tumor in the lower part. The superior thyroid artery and thyrolingual trunk can still be preserved in the initial area. The facial artery must be sacrificed, as must the external carotid artery, which lies cranial to it. The internal jugular vein is removed caudally and cranially and ligated twice. The external carotid artery is resected in the area of the superficial temporal artery at the border to the entry into the parotid ligament and ligated twice. The internal jugular vein is removed at the entrance to the base of the skull and ligated twice. The hypoglossal nerve is infiltrated by tumor and must also be resected. The internal carotid artery and vagus nerve can be preserved. Accessory nerve is also resected. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is removed cranially. Resection with parts of the cervical plexus and the deep neck muscles if necessary to achieve complete removal in sano. The digastric muscle and submandibular gland are resected en bloc with the tumor in the sense of a pull through. As the operation progresses, it becomes apparent that, in addition to the per-continuitatem situation, there has also been a lateral invasion of the soft tissues of the hyoid bone. The pharyngeal wall is therefore lifted away from the prevertebral fascia. The hyoid bone is resected laterally. The upper part of the superior cornu is also resected. All soft tissues and the mucosa up to the piriform sinus entrance are resected. The posterior wall of the oropharynx and hypopharynx are resected in the necessary portion up to the oropharyngeal entrance up to half. A marginal sample is taken from the posterior wall of the pharynx up to the entrance of the piriform sinus. This is tumor-free, in the cranial area there are still questionable tumor infiltrates in small foci, approx. 1 cm below the tube area, which were partially resected. Another marginal sample was taken and then sent back for a frozen section. This is now tumor-free. A marginal sample is taken from the cranial basal soft tissue. No tumor infiltrates here either. An extensive marginal sample was taken from the caudal area, from the soft tissue at the base of the tongue towards the vallecula and the entrance to the larynx as well as the entrance to the piriform sinus. This is also tumor-free. Surgical resection can therefore now be assumed to be R0. The result is a defect from the tube to the hypopharynx, including the posterior wall of the oropharynx as well as the floor of the mouth, base of the tongue and the entire palate. The mandible was not infiltrated and the periosteum could be easily removed. The edge of the mandible at the angulus is chiseled off with a chisel to achieve a smaller transition and a better overview. All areas of the pterygoid muscle were also resected. The neck dissection on the left side was carried out including level I b and I a. Gland was also resected in the tumor. The lingual nerve and inferior alveolar nerve were also resected. Neck dissection left includes levels I to V. Neck dissection on the right side now follows. This is performed in a typical manner, including levels II to V. The defect is now covered using the anterolateral thigh flap: On the left side, a superior thyroid artery and the truncus thyrolingualis or terminal branch of the external carotid artery are available for vascular connection. The external jugular vein is available for the venous connection. This is followed by Doppler sonography in the anterolateral thigh area. Four perforators can be identified. The flap size was previously measured at 20 x 8 cm. A three-dimensionally configured thigh flap was measured and marked according to the defect. First, medial skin incision. Showing the rectus and vastus lateralis muscles. The ramus descendens can be dissected between these muscles. Then dissect the flap from the lateral side, also subfascially. Caudally dissect the vascular pedicle and ligate it. Successive development of the flap with inclusion of parts of the vastus lateralis muscle corresponding to the course of the perforators. Dissection in the direction of the exit from the profunda femoris artery. The artery and vein are removed here. Arterial and venous stumps are each treated with puncture ligatures. The primary closure is then performed in a typical low-tension manner with the insertion of a Redon drain. The thigh flap is inserted transcervically into the defect and sutured in place with relatively little tension using 3.0 single Vicryl button sutures. The complex defect is covered from the floor of the mouth via the base of the tongue, pharyngeal wall and the entire palatal arch with minimal tension. The flap vessels and the external jugular vein are then conditioned, as is the terminal branch of the external carotid artery, which is selected for flap anastomosis. Vascular suturing is performed with 8.0 ethilon sutures between the external carotid artery, terminal branch and descending ramus. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow and good venous return. Venous anastomosis between the common terminal flap vein and the external jugular vein after measuring with a Coupler measuring device using a 4/0 Coupler. Good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. Now follows layered wound closure on the right cervical side with insertion of a Redon drain. Left cervical with insertion of a flap. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma and insertion of an 8.0 tracheal cannula. Marking of the course of the flap pedicle for postoperative Doppler control. Checking the flap enorally shows a well-perfused flap. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics with Unacid for 1 week. Feeding via PEG for at least 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Heparin perfusor for 5 days ......... per hour. Regular Doppler checks according to the scheme and enoral flap checks. Overall cT4 cN2c multistage carcinoma, postoperative RCT certainly required.","Pharynxteilresektion + Neck dissection + Tracheostoma

Removal of the tumor in one piece. Suture marking of the tumor with several sutures. Sending for frozen section. Tumor completely removed in sano. Also marginal samples in sano, thus overall R0 situation. Careful hemostasis. PEG placement, tracheostomy placement and neck dissection on both sides by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequent decision to perform flexible esophagogastroscopy for PEG placement in the typical manner.

No B-symptomatics, no dysphagia. Nicotine abstinence for 5 years with Z.n. approx. 50 py. In 2008, a panendoscopy and ablation of 2 space-occupying lesions in the left posterior pharyngeal wall and left posterior pharyngeal/hypopharyngeal wall had already been performed. At that time there was no histological evidence of malignancy. Lupenlaryngoscopy currently shows an unclear mass in the area of the vocal fold on the right. Therefore, there is an indication for the above-mentioned operation.","Introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleague. Tracheoscopy is performed with 0° optics. The trachea is visible up to the bifurcation, no evidence of a tumor or pathological mass. In the posterior region of the middle third of the vocal folds on the right side, the papillomatous, broad-based mass is visible. Otherwise non-irritated vocal folds on both sides. The surgeon performs intubation without complications. Positioning of the patient and start of esophagogastroscopy. Careful advancement through the esophagus into the stomach while carefully protecting the patient's remaining teeth. Orienting endoscopy in the stomach. The inversion reveals a non-irritated mucosa, no evidence of a tumor, no evidence of bleeding. Aspiration of the air and careful reflection back through the esophagus with constant air insufflation. Irritation-free mucosal conditions here too. Start with panendoscopy. Careful entry with the size C small bore tube. Orienting inspection of the oral cavity. In the case of post-TE, the mucous membrane is non-irritated, the tongue is smooth and there is no evidence of a tumor. Only in the area of the oral vestibule, in the area of the incisors/upper jaw, is there a slightly hyperplastic mucosa, most likely a pressure point of the prosthesis. This does not appear to be suspicious for malignancy. Mirroring into the oropharynx. Irritation-free mucosal conditions here as well. Only the left vallecula shows a retention cyst. This was completely removed. Insertion of a suprarenin-soaked swab. Short wait. The blood is dry. Sinus piriformes can be freely unfolded on both sides, no evidence of tumor. Postcricoid mucosa without irritation. Lingual epiglottis without irritation. The laryngeal epiglottis is also without irritation. Endolaryngeal mucosa without irritation. Now adjusting the glottic plane with the aid of the microscope. This shows the previously described papillomatous, broad-based mass in the posterior region of the middle third of the vocal fold on the right. It hangs on the free edge of the vocal fold and extends to the lower edge of the glottic plane. Primarily not typically suspicious for malignancy. The papillomatous mass is removed sharply at the margins, carefully preserving the vocal ligament. On palpation, there is a slight adhesion of the mass to the vocal ligament. Since, in consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the mass does not appear to be primarily suspicious for malignancy, the vocal ligament is carefully preserved. The tissue is sent for histological processing. Insertion of a suprarenin-soaked swab. Short wait. The blood is dry. After re-inspection of the sampling site, there is no bleeding. The procedure is therefore completed without complications due to dry blood. Final consultation with the anesthesia colleague. Conclusion: Panendoscopy without complications with removal of a left vallecula cyst and removal of an unclear glottic mass on the right. The tissue is sent for histological processing. The findings on the vocal fold on the right do not appear to be primarily suspicious of malignancy microscopically, which is why care is primarily taken to completely spare the vocal ligament during resection. However, if the findings reveal a malignancy, a subsequent resection will certainly be necessary. This can be carried out using a laser if the setting is very good.","Exzision RF Glottis rechts, Panendo, MLE

Mirror endoscopy revealed an exophytic protrusion in the area of the entire right vocal fold. No vocal fold stagnation, inspectorically no involvement of the arytenoid region. Ventrally, the mass approaches the anterior commissure. Transfer of the patient to the operating room and preliminary consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. Induction of intubation anesthesia by the colleagues and rigid 0° tracheoscopy by the surgeon. No abnormalities here. The gastroscopy is now performed with the flexible instrument in the usual manner without any abnormalities. Inspection of the hypopharynx after inserting the mouth guard and entering with the small bore tube. The piriform sinus can be freely unfolded on both sides and is free of masses, as are the postcricoid region, the supraglottis and the base of the tongue. Now charge the epiglottis and inspect the glottis. This reveals a clear exophytic mass in the area of the right vocal fold, which extends to the anterior commissure. The tumor did not spread to the left vocal fold. The tumor is now positioned in the area of the anterior commissure and carefully loosened with the CO2 laser. The tumor is successively pulled mediodorsally so that the resection is performed directly on the thyroid cartilage. Now also inspect the postcricoid region, after moving the small bore tube and the support autoscopy, detach from the vocal process, taking it with you, and medialize the tumour with the double spoon. Now detach the lateral border in the direction of the morgue sinus. Macroscopically, the tumor can be safely laser resected at a distance of at least 5 mm. After complete removal, even after cutting through the mucosa in the subglottic area, a safe tumor resection has been performed macroscopically. The tumor is marked with sutures and sent for frozen section diagnostics. This reveals a margin-forming tumor with involvement in the area of the lateral resection margin towards the morgue sinus. Inclusion of <CLINICIAN_NAME> and renewed resection of the remaining structures in the area of the morgue sinus. The thyroid cartilage is now completely exposed. After resubmission of the specimen obtained for frozen section histological assessment, no further tumor infestation was found. An R0 resection can therefore be assumed. Subtle hemostasis using a monopolar aspirator and waiting until there is no more blood (approx. 1 hour during the frozen section break). Shortly before the end of the operation, re-inspection with the small water tube, no further bleeding. Summary: Laser resection of a T1a glottic carcinoma on the right side, in frozen section R0. Please await the final histopathological assessment and case discussion in the interdisciplinary tumor conference. A control panendoscopy should be performed in 6-8 weeks.","Laser-Chordektomie rechts

Midline not crossed. Panendoscopy performed. Indication is clear.,"<CLINICIAN_NAME> Tumor resection: First insertion of mouth retractor, followed by tongue tie suture. Using an electric knife and scissors, the tumor is resected macroscopically on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm. Resection extends to just below the midline and also includes parts of the base of the tongue and floor of the mouth. Resectate is thread-marked for frozen section assessment. In addition, a lateral margin sample is taken from the alveolar ridge. In the frozen section, all margins after tumor resection in sano also basally. Thus R0 resection. Rearrangement for neck dissection. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME> Neck dissection: Positioning of the patient by the surgeon. Ablation of the surgical site and sterile draping. As a basal cell carcinoma has already been resected externally in the area of the left helical attachment, the resection is now performed here at the beginning. Marking of the spindle-shaped resection margins. Subsequent spindle-shaped resection of the clinically macroscopically inconspicuous scar. Inferior suture marking before placement of the post-resection. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Now proceed to neck dissection on the left side. Marking of the mandible and the ascending mandibular branch as well as the jugulum. Identify the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle by palpation. Mark the planned incision on the anterior belly of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which extends caudally to the lateral side. Make the skin incision and sharply cut through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Exposure of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. For reasons of clarity, the external jugular vein must be cut off and severed later on. However, the auricular nerve is spared. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is then exposed in its course. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle as the caudal border. Blunt dissection of the same up to the hyoid. The accessorius nerve is then exposed and protected. Dissection of the posterior digastric venter muscle as the cranial border. Proceed to dissection of the cervical vascular sheath. Locate the jugular vein at the level of the omohyoid muscle. Then successive dissection along the internal jugular vein cranially to below the digastric abdomen. This reveals a prominent superior thyroid vein. A typical venous angle with a facial vein is not found here. During the dissection, at least 2 clinically macroscopically suspicious lymph nodes are found in region II and in the area of the superior thyroid vein. It was therefore decided to extend the neck dissection on the left side to 5 regions. Subsequent exposure and protection of the hypoglossal nerve. Meticulous clearing of the accessorius triangle and successive development of the lateral neck preparation. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation. The medial neck preparation is then developed. This also includes exposure of the submandibular gland. After consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the lingual artery is now explored and ligated twice to prevent bleeding. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation. Insertion of a moist abdominal drape. Transition to the right side: Here too, at the beginning of the operation, mark the lower edge of the mandible and the ascending mandibular branch. Make the skin incision in the area of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which extends caudally to the lateral side. Sharp dissection of the subcutaneous fatty tissue and exposure of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Both structures can be spared intraoperatively. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in its course. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle as the caudal boundary and blunt dissection of the same up to the hyoid. Subsequent exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve and the posterior venter of the digastric muscle. Proceed to dissection of the cervical vascular sheath. Locate the internal jugular vein at the level of the lower edge of the omohyoid muscle. Successive dissection along the jugular vein and visualization of the vein angle. Dissection of the facial vein up to the submandibular gland including resection of the gland capsule. Subsequent exposure of the common carotid artery and the bifurcation. Subsequent entry into level II b for development of the complete lateral neck preparation. This is performed while sparing the plexus branches. After exposing the hypoglossal nerve, the medial neck preparation is then removed. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Irrigation of the wound using H2O2 and NaCl on both sides. Insertion and insertion of a 10 Redon drain and subsequent two-layer wound closure. Intraoperative frozen section analysis of the post-resection in the area of the left helical attachment showed no residual basal cell carcinoma in the processed frozen section preparation. An R0 resection can therefore be assumed here. Therefore, two-layer wound closure in the area of the helical attachment and completion of the operation without complications. Note: This resulted in a neck dissection on the left in the regions level I b, II a, II b, III, IV and V due to the intraoperative macroscopic suspicion of lymph node metastasis in regions II and III. On the right side, the neck was dissected in levels I b, II a, II b, III and IV. The operation was completed without complications.","Partielle Glossektomie, Neck diss. bds.; PEG-Anlage

Insertion of the PEG tube in the typical manner. Repositioning for tumor tonsillectomy: The ulcerating tumor described above is seen in the area of the right tonsil lobe, which extends far into the base of the tongue Starting at the upper pole of the tonsil, it is now successively detached from the muscles of the palate with the electric knife. Repeated careful hemostasis using bipolar electrocoagulation. The tumor has infiltrated deep into the muscles at the base of the tongue. The lingual artery and vein must be ligated. The tumor was removed en bloc and a resection was performed in the area of the posterior palatal arch, although macroscopically it was not completely free of tumor. Overall, the tumor was removed with a safety margin of 0.5 to 1 cm. Due to the extensive infiltration into the neck musculature, <CLINICIAN_NAME> decided not to perform a neck dissection at the same time and to wait for stable wound conditions. After waiting for repeated bipolar coagulation towards the base of the tongue, there is hemostasis. Now repositioning for tracheotomy. After infiltration anesthesia of xylocaine with adrenaline 1 % 1:200 000, skin incision about 2 transverse fingers below the cricoid cartilage. Now dissection of the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Division of the prelaryngeal musculature by entering the linea alba. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus and ligation of a large longitudinal vein. This is undermined with the Overholt and severed by clamping two isthmus clamps in the area of the isthmus. Here, the isthmus is sutured and bipolar electrocoagulation is performed again. Entry into the trachea below the 2nd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a caudally pedicled tracheal flap and incision for epithelialization as well as two skin sutures laterally. Problem-free insertion of an 8-gauge ruffled cannula. Now re-inspection of the tumor bed in the area of the oropharynx. There is no bleeding here. This ends the procedure. Overall extensive tumor in the area of the left tonsil lobe with infiltration into the base of the tongue. Temporary placement of a tracheostoma due to the increased risk of secondary bleeding. Neck dissection and, if necessary, resection in the area of the tumor bed should be performed at intervals of about 10 days.","Tumortonsillektomie rechts, Tracheotomie, PEG-Anlage

The external ENT colleague carried out a test biopsy in case of tonsillar carcinoma and found evidence of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore indication for the above procedure. Computed tomography currently shows cN0 neck status (primary in the tonsil cannot be visualized due to artefacts), sonographically at least a nodus on the opposite side on the right in level II.","After active patient identification, the patient is taken to the operating room. Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleague after an inconspicuous tracheoscopy by the surgeon. Carry out the team time-out. Start of oesophagogastroscopy: problem-free insertion of the endoscope into the oesophagus and advancement into the stomach. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions on all sides. The mucosa in the esophagus is also normal. Then carry out the panendoscopy: first inspect and palpate the oral cavity, tongue, base of the tongue and floor of the mouth. A tumor measuring approx. 1 to 1 ˝ cm is palpated in the left tonsil. Otherwise unremarkable findings. Now insertion of the mouth guard and insertion of the size C small bore tube. Tonsil lobe on the right and base of tongue as well as vallecula with epiglottis are unremarkable. Inconspicuous hypopharynx. Inconspicuous endolarynx. Now irrigation of the endolarynx with sodium chloride by <CLINICIAN_NAME> (<STUDY_NAME> study). Then proceed to tumor tonsillectomy on the left side: insertion of the McIvor oral spatula. The carcinoma is exophytic in the lower half of the left tonsil, with no evidence of deep infiltration. Therefore, initially start as for normal tonsillectomy with parauvular mucosal incision and dissection of the capsule. Exposure of the upper pole vessels and bipolar coagulation as well as removal of the upper pole vessels. Then dissect along the capsule up to about half of the tonsil. Subsequently, in the area of the lower half of the tonsil, where the carcinoma is located, work is carried out at a distance of approx. 0.5 to 1 cm, both in terms of the mucosa and the depth. Therefore, the muscles of the palatine arch were taken to the depths and the excision extended to the base of the tongue. Repeated bipolar coagulation of several vessels. At the end, a prominent vessel is stitched twice. The removed tonsil is then examined. A PE for the <STUDY_NAME> study is obtained from the middle of this. Otherwise, the resectate distance to the healthy person in the caudal area is relatively small at approx. 4 to 5 mm compared to the other margins. Therefore, resectate in the caudal mucosa area. Both specimens are now sent for frozen section. Subsequently, with protracted bleeding from the base of the tongue, a deep incision is also made here after multiple bipolar coagulation and continued bleeding. Subsequently dry conditions. The operation was therefore completed at this point without complications. Conclusion: cT1 tonsillar carcinoma on the left. Computed tomography cN0 neck status, sonography also cN0, but with a suspicious nodus in level II on the right that is worth checking. In addition, several thyroid nodules, some without ......... and microcalcifications, therefore nuclear medicine clarification recommended here (scintigraphy unfortunately only possible in 2 ˝ months due to the CT scan performed). Due to the suspicious nodus in level II on the opposite side, primary advice for selective neck dissection on both sides.","Tumor-Tonsillektomie, Panendo

In summary of panendoscopy, CT findings and sonography cT2 cN2b G3 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the indication for primary surgical treatment was made. The patient was also found to have severe visual impairment due to macular degeneration.","Initial inspection and palpation of the findings. There is an exulcerated mass in the area of the middle and cranial tonsil pole, clearly growing laterally submucosally. Here, however, it can be palpated and moved in depth. Parauvular triangle just free of tumor. No growth beyond the posterior palatal arch or beyond the caudal tonsil pole. Endoscopic PEG placement is performed first. This is done with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy advancement into the stomach. Excellent diaphanoscopy. Problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. The stomach and oesophagus are otherwise unremarkable in the mirror findings. Now turn to transoral tumor resection. Insertion of the tonsil retractor and oral tumor resection in the sense of a radical tonsillectomy. Complete removal of the anterior palatal arch. Resection up to the parauvular level. There is a good displacement layer above the tumor in depth. Here complete in sano removal. Release of the tonsil at the transition to the base of the tongue, basally towards the posterior palatal arch, removal of muscles. No further tumor growth here. Deposition at the posterior palatal arch to the lower tonsil pole, macroscopically in sano. The specimen now only shows a small safety margin parauvularly due to shrinkage, otherwise a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm on all sides at the mucosal level. Basally, the tumor is intact, but due to the thin tissue conditions above the capsule, there is a narrow safety margin. A narrow resection is performed in the area of the soft palate and parauvularly to ensure R0 resection. The specimen and the additional marginal sample are thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. All mucosal margins were found to be completely free of tumor and dysplasia. Only in the basal area is there a narrow R0 situation with a distance of just under 0.1 cm, but with tumor-free margins. The case and findings are now discussed with <CLINICIAN_NAME> due to the narrow basal resection margin. In the case of microscopic but narrow R0 resection, a corresponding post-resection or covering margin specimens are now created. For this purpose, superficial muscle resection. Covering of the area close to the capsule, which corresponds to the lateral tonsil bed. Finally, ablation of the musculature. Only a small amount of circumscribed prolapsing fatty tissue. This is coagulated. The surrounding and tumor capsule-covering musculature is diagnosed as completely tumor-free in the frozen section diagnosis. Therefore, an R0 resection can be assumed here. Careful wound inspection. Wound surface is clearly visible and can be explored. Two adapting sutures are now placed in the area of the parauvular mucosa. Here, too, the conditions towards the back of the soft palate are intact, so that good swallowing function appears to be guaranteed. The neck dissection of the right side is now performed during the frozen section pauses. For this, a submandibular skin incision is made. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. Clearing out the anterior neck preparation while carefully protecting the cervical artery, the superior thyroid artery, the facial vein and the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of level V a with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches after exposure and dissection of the cervical vascular sheath. Overall, no macroscopically highly suspicious masses. Careful wound inspection and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Turn to the opposite side. Same procedure here in principle. Sonographically there is a cN2b neck status. Corresponding incision. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland. Palpation of rough, suspicious nodes in levels II a and II b with transition to level V a. Visualization of the accessorius nerve. This is free. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with careful preservation of the superior thyroid artery, the facial vein, the cervical vein and the hypoglossal nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. A large metastasis measuring a good 3 cm can be seen in the jugulo-facial angle. Clearing of the accessorius triangle. Highly suspicious change here as well. Sparing involvement of the surrounding musculature. At the transition to level V a, it can now be seen that a highly suspicious nodule is infiltrating the cervical plexus in a circumscribed manner, so this must be resected in a circumscribed manner. Complete release up to the transition from level V b, also complete release below the cervical plexus. Overall in level II b and V a several small but highly visible lesions due to the macroscopic changes. Careful palpation of the supraclavicular and infraclavicular region as well as paravertebrally. No further nodules here. Therefore, after careful wound inspection, irrigation with H2 and Ringer's solution. Then insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Final enoral inspection again. Multiple checks for blood dryness. Circumscribed final hemostasis. However, if the wound is dry overall and the wound cavity is clearly visible, a tracheostomy is not performed due to the high degree of visual impairment and lack of swelling. The procedure was subsequently completed without any indication of complications. The patient received intraoperative antibiotics with Unacid 3 g. Please continue this for 24 hours postoperatively. The patient should abstain from food for at least 2 to 4 days, then carefully and gradually build up her diet. Due to the cervical metastasis, adjuvant therapy appears to be urgently required.","Transorale Tumorresektion, radikale Neck dissection

A rather flat, exophytic mass was found in the area of the posterior palatal arch and the posterior pharyngeal wall as well as partially in the tonsil on the right side. Start of tumor resection with the monopolar needle. It soon becomes apparent that the tumor has deeper parts. Then dissection in depth. Here, massive venous bleeding suddenly occurs. This can no longer be controlled by transoral measures. Therefore, the oropharynx is tamponaded and the neck is opened on the right side. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Identification of the external carotid artery. Then temporary clamping of the external carotid artery with a reinforced bulldog, nevertheless further bleeding, then further dissection of the cervical vascular sheath.

Then further surgery in the neck on the right side and start with the neck dissection. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Then removal of the neck specimens IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches and sparing the hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. Dissection of the neck vessels. It can be seen that there are only very slender vessels here, both venous and arterial, and that this side is also not suitable for connecting the radialis graft. On the left side, neck dissection through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>, exposing the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposing the submandibular gland, the omohyoid and the digastric muscle. Then expose the cervical vascular sheath, the hypoglossus and the accessorius nerve and remove the neck preparation IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Dissection of the vessels. This also shows a very, very thin superior thyroid artery and the facial artery is also unsuitable for connection of an anastomosis; the venous situation is significantly better than on the right side. There is a very thick facial artery with an outlet, which is perfectly possible for venous connection. For the arterial connection, the external carotid artery itself is prepared in the cranial region above the exit of the superior facial and lingual thyroid arteries and also above the ascending pharyngeal artery, then cut downwards. In the meantime, the radial artery graft is lifted in bloodlessness by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (7 x 9 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Defect coverage of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. At the beginning of the operation, a PEG was placed with good diaphanoscopy using the thread pull-through method. Continue antibiotics. The patient can wake up postoperatively, but should continue to be monitored in the intensive care unit. Block attempt without an X-ray pre-swallow on the 10th postoperative day.","Resektion, Neck diss. bds., Tracheotomie, PEG-Anlage, Defektdeckung, Freier Lappen (Radialis)

First of all, the endolarynx is adjusted again with the Kleinsasser C-tube. Here you can see an exophytic mass limited to the right vocal fold with insufficient adjustability. Removal of the instruments without tooth damage. Now transition to surgery from the outside. Vertical serrated skin incision and sharp dissection through the subcutis down to the straight neck muscles. This is pushed apart in the linea alba and held to the side. Then skeletonize the thyroid cartilage including the cricoid cartilage. Incision of the perichondrium on the outer side cranially and caudally so that a right pedicled perichondrium flap can be dissected. Subperichondrial dissection is then performed cranially and caudally in the area of the anterior incisure of the thyroid cartilage. The thyroid cartilage is then cut open in the middle with the small circular saw blade and held apart. The soft tissues in the median plane can then also be pushed apart or cut sharply so that the larynx can be opened up. Here you can now see the tumor on the right side, which extends into the anterior commissure. The mucosa here is somewhat raised and uneven due to the previous dissection. Now begin with the resection, initially cranially in the area of the supraglottis on the right side. Part of the vocal fold slope must also be resected caudally, as it is also affected by tumor in the anterior part. Large parts of the vocalis muscle are resected basally. Resection is performed dorsally, following the tumor margins at an appropriate distance. The arytenoid cartilage is reached and the ventral part of the arytenoid cartilage must also be resected due to the extent of the tumor. Circumferential marginal incisions are then made, particularly in the area of the anterior commissure, which also includes the opposite side. The marginal incisions all proved to be tumor-free. Only in the area of the arytenoid cartilage are there still punctiform infiltrates. Extensive resection is therefore performed here. The further marginal incision from this area is then also tumor-free. The drill holes are then made to reunite the thyroid cartilage after it has been smoothed endolaryngeally in the area of the incision using the Lindemann burr. Placement of a rein suture on the left vocal fold ventrally. Reconstruction of the thyroid cartilage as well as the cricothyroid membrane using several sutures. Folding back of the perichondrium flap. Application of fibrin glue, which was also previously applied to the resection area. Application of a Tachosil plate to the thyroid cartilage. Insertion of a drainage flap under the sutured straight neck muscles. Final two-layer wound closure. Sterile wound dressing. Finally, another inspection of the endolarynx transorally. Aspiration of a small amount of secretion with inconspicuous and dry wound conditions. End of the operation and handover of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: External partial laryngectomy in the sense of an external chordectomy on the right side for cT1a laryngeal carcinoma with spread to the arytenoid cartilage on the right. Control panendoscopy in 8 weeks.","Externe Chordektomie

Immediately preoperatively, there was a cN2c neck status sonographically. There was a clear internal cardiologic comorbidity. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure with laryngectomy was discussed as an alternative to primary RCT. After detailed preoperative discussions, the decision was made to proceed with surgery.","Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: After induction and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, the primary tumor is inspected again. This is done with the Kleinsasser tube under dental protection. Inspection of the inconspicuous oral cavity and the oral vestibule. The exophytic tumor begins in the area of the pharyngoepiglottic fold on the left side of the oropharynx. This moves via the pharyngoepiglottic fold to the epiglottis, clearly infiltrates this on the left side and grows here via the aryepiglottic fold towards the ary and also infiltrates this on the left side. In addition, growth into the left piriform sinus, which is tumorously displaced at least in the entrance area. The glottic level as well as the esophageal entrance and the right side are completely tumor-free. The PEG tube was therefore initially inserted. Insertion with the esophagoscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy advancement into the stomach. Excellent diaphanoscopy. Problem-free puncture of the stomach and subsequent insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. Repositioning of the patient. Marking and preparation of a broad-based apron flap. Subplatysmal preparation and suturing of the flap for neck dissection of the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure and dissection of the omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland and exposure of the digastric muscle. Level II shows an extensive lymph node conglomerate, clinically clearly corresponding to metastases, and also clinically clear metastasis on palpation in level IV at the transition to V lateral to the internal jugular vein. Release of the anterior neck preparation. The facial vein is infiltrated and is deposited at the jugular vein after ligation. Exposure and preservation of the cervical vein and hypoglossal nerve as well as the superior thyroid artery. Free dissection of the internal jugular vein, common carotid artery and vagus nerve. These can be dissected freely upwards. The internal jugular vein is reduced due to the ambient pressure in the lumen, but is clearly not infiltrated. Overall, highly volnerable metastases on dissection of the accessorius nerve. After exclusion of infiltration, vulnerable mass, but absolute in-sano resection in handling. Clearing and completion of the accessorius triangle and completion towards level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. No evidence of lymph leakage caudally. Here, lateral to the vein, as already described above, also vulnerable and clinically suspicious lesion, which is removed dead. Subsequent left-sided dissection of the infrahyoid musculature and release of the pharyngeal tube on the prevertebral fascia. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Neck dissection on the right. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the accessorius nerve. Then exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein and the facial nerve. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and the digastric muscle. Dissection of the neck preparation II a to V a, sparing the plexus branches. Exposure of the hyoid bone on the right side. This is not done on the left side, as the tumor may already be breaking through the soft tissues of the neck. Detachment of the oblique laryngeal muscles. Release of the piriform sinus. Careful release of the piriform sinus on the left side. This is only possible to a very limited extent so as not to cut into the tumor. Enter the pharynx just below the hyoid bone on the right side. Now you reach the posterior surface of the epiglottis. At the edge of the epiglottis, incise into the pharynx, extending the incision dorsally along the edge of the epiglottis. Inspection of the inside of the pharynx and the tumor region. Here it becomes clear that the tumor does not infiltrate the posterior pharyngeal wall, but only the lateral pharyngeal wall and the piriform sinus on the left side as well as the aryepiglottic fold and the pharyngoepiglottic fold and the arytenoid cartilage on the left side and the left side of the larynx. Now incise the mucosa along the edge of the epiglottis on the right side. Then incise along the right arytenoid cartilage and the postcricoid region. Release the piriform sinus completely and turn the larynx over to the left side. Release of the mucosa at the base of the tongue. Excision of the tumor borders with a safety margin of 1.5 cm. Finally, detachment and removal of the larynx below the cricoid cartilage. Before this, the trachea was opened and reintubation performed. Now take marginal samples from the esophageal entrance, pharyngeal side wall and base of tongue. All marginal samples go to the frozen section. Here R0 on all sides. The creation of a provox is dispensed with due to the patient's wishes. Now reduction of the insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides. Suture the pharynx in the usual three-layered manner. The pharyngeal suture must be performed with particular care in the area of the base of the tongue, as quite a lot of mucosa was resected here, but there is still sufficient mucosa to close the pharynx without tension. Before the pharyngeal suture, an esophageal myotomy was performed in the upper sphincter. Incision of the tracheostoma and two-layer wound closure after placement of two Redon drainage tubes. Continue antibiotics for 24 hours. Rötgenbreischluck on the 10th postoperative day, then diet build-up.  ","Tumorresektion, ND bds, PEG-Anlage

Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Positioning of the head and insertion of spandex and dental protection. Attachment of the tongue. Insertion of the blocker. This is somewhat difficult until the tumor region is well exposed. Inserting the robotic arms into the DaVinci device and positioning the arms and the camera in the mouth area. It can be seen that the tumor completely occupies the upper pole of the tonsil on the left side and is in contact with the anterior and posterior palatal arch. In depth, the tumor extends relatively far laterally. Now grasp the anterior palatal arch and begin with the tumor resection. In the course of the tumor resection, it is confirmed that the tumor extends very far to the lateral pharyngeal wall, so that it must be resected including the muscles in this area. Now complete the resection caudally to the base of the tongue and medially to the area of the posterior palatal arch. A minimal margin may remain from the posterior palatal arch. The specimen can be retrieved in toto and also removed macroscopically in healthy tissue. Neck fat tissue is exposed on the lateral pharyngeal wall and a clear pulsation can be seen underneath. Now take marginal samples from the depths of the caudal anterior and posterior palatal arch. The marginal samples go to the frozen section. R0 situation in the frozen section. The tumor specimen is sent for final histology. Hemostasis during tumor resection using monopolar coagulation. Due to the pharyngeal defect and the pulsating carotid artery lying very close underneath, neck dissection in the primary procedure must be omitted in this case. Finally, placement of a nasogastric feeding tube. The patient goes to the ENT intensive care unit for monitoring. Please feed via the nasogastric tube for 8 days and plan a secondary neck dissection on both sides. Then presentation at the tumor conference.","Transorale roboterassistierte Tumortonsillektomie links

Growth through the pharyngeal wall on CT, therefore resection with flap coverage indicated.","After intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again. This shows the deep ulcerated tumor with palpable infiltration even beyond the visible tumor borders. This once again confirmed the indication for surgery. Subsequently, PEG placement. PEG placement (<CLINICIAN_NAME>/<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Entering with the gastroesophagoscope and pre-scanning into the stomach under air insufflation. Spontaneous diaphanoscopy is given here, therefore indication for PEG insertion using the thread pull-through method. This was performed without any problems. Withdrawal of the endoscope. Then sterile draping and skin disinfection of all relevant surgical areas including the left forearm and right thigh. Tracheotomy (<CLINICIAN_NAME>/PJ): Due to the planned incision for the neck dissection, vertical incision on both sides for the tracheotomy. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Entering the midline. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Entering the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp. Insertion of a visor tracheotomy in the typical manner. The mucocutaneous anastomosis is performed using Ethibond sutures. An 8-gauge cannula is inserted. Neck dissection on the right: Incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in a curved line. Skin incision with the 15 mm scalpel. Skin is cut through. Subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, lifting of the skin platysma flap. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, internal jugular vein posterior to the digastric muscle and submandibular gland and accessory nerve. Now start with the release of the neck preparation in level IIb to level Vb. The branches of the cervical plexus are largely spared. The accessorius nerve is also spared. The vagus nerve is also spared, the hypoglossus is exposed and spared and the cervical artery and external carotid artery are also exposed and spared. Level IIa, IIb, III, IV, Va and Vb were thus evacuated. Punctual hemostasis and two-layer wound closure using 4-0 Vicryl and 5-0 Ethilon. Prior to this, placement of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Neck dissection on the left (dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>): Incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in a curved line. Skin incision with a 15 mm scalpel. Skin is cut through. Subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, lifting of the skin platysma flap. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, the posterior venter of the digastric muscle of the submandibular gland and the accessorius nerve. Exposure of the internal jugular vein and the jugulofacial angle. This shows a metastasis that is connected to the internal jugular vein and facial vein and is carefully dissected off. Now start with the release of the remaining neck preparation in level Ib to level Vb. The branches of the cervical plexus are spared. The accessorius nerve is also spared. The vagus nerve is also visualized and spared. The hypoglossal nerve is visualized and spared as well as the cervical artery. The common, internal and external carotid arteries are now exposed and the superior thyroid artery, the facial artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery are dissected as possible connecting vessels. Levels Ib, IIa, IIb, III, IV, Va and Vb were therefore evacuated. Subsequently, combined transcervical and transoral tumor resection: Firstly, from the cervical side, dissection of the large neck vessels and dissection of the pharyngeal tube. This particularly concerns the external and internal carotid arteries. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and the vagus nerve, which are secured together with the cervical vascular sheath and the corresponding vessels using a vessel loop. Also exposure and preservation of the border cord. Stripping of the pharyngeal tube. The facial artery is already severed here. A large branch of the external carotid artery in the direction of the tonsil ligature is also ligated twice. Subsequent resection of the tumor: safety margin of at least 1.5 cm macroscopically. The palatal arch on the left falls away completely from the uvula, larger parts of the thyroid muscles, resection extends over the alveolar ridge, the glossoalveolar junction and into the base of the tongue. The lingual nerve cannot be preserved. Complete resection of the pharyngeal wall including parts of the base of the tongue. The submandibular gland is included in the preparation from the outside. The specimen is then marked with sutures and marginal samples are taken from the lateral alveolar ridge from the cranial side in the area of the palate and from the medial side from the palatal arch area to the beginning of the posterior pharyngeal wall. All marginal samples and also the entire tumor specimen in healthy tissue, i.e. R0 situation. This is followed by careful hemostasis. Measurement of the defect 10 x 8-9 cm. Now elevation of the radial flap: Dictation of <CLINICIAN_NAME> skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Locate the cephalic vein and dissect it radially. Finding and dissection of the pedicle between the muscle bellies of the brachioradialis and flexor carpi radialis muscles in depth. Dissection of the venous star. Dissection of the cephalic vein, an accompanying vein and the interosseous vein as possible connecting vessels. Dissection of the radial artery up to the brachial artery. Now incision of the ulnar flap and subfascial dissection. Incision of the radial end of the flap with inclusion of the cephalic vein in the flap. This extends relatively far radially here. Further dissection of the pedicle with clipping of the perforator vessels. Further saturation of 100% after removal of the flap. Then suture the radial flap into the defect. This is done using 3-0 Vicryl single-button sutures, partly with pre-positioning. A tension-free and complete reconstruction of all areas is achieved. Then vascular sutures. Conditioning of the radial artery and the facial artery. Suture using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. Subsequent conditioning of a V. thyroidea media and an outlet from the V. facialis. This is done using 3-0 and 2.5 mm couplers. In each case, good venous return after opening the clamps, positive smear phenomenon. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Irrigation. Layered wound closure on the right with insertion of a Redon drainage on the left with insertion of 2 flaps. Removal of split skin from the right thigh and closure of the left forearm with insertion of the split skin graft (dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>/<CLINICIAN_NAME>) Removal of the split skin from the right thigh with the dermatome in the usual manner. Subsequent apposition of the arm. Insertion of a size 9 tracheostomy tube, followed by completion of the procedure without complications. Patient received Unacid intraoperatively. Please continue antibiotics for one week postoperatively. Please check the flap enorally and if necessary by Doppler according to the scheme for 5 days. Continue heparin perfusor at 1 mg per hour for about 5 days. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube for at least 10-12 days, then gruel and, if necessary, start to build up the diet. Overall cT2-3 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left. Suspicious lymph nodes on both sides. Please wait for the final histology.

Due to the patient's condition following radiochemotherapy of up to 64 Gy in the past, a tumor resection was indicated.","Panendoscopy at the beginning of the operation. This shows a tumor island in the area of the arytenoid hump on the left side. Otherwise, a main tumor mass can be seen in the area of the pocket crease on the right side, which completely occupies it and also extends from here towards the morgue sinus. From here, the tumor extends into the area of the anterior commissure and appears to cross it at the median line. The glottic plane itself appears to be tumor-free. The panendoscopy is then completed with otherwise unremarkable mirror conditions. After repositioning the patient, inject local anesthetic with adrenaline pretracheally. Then transverse incision above the trachea and preparation in depth. Locate the prelaryngeal muscles, which are cut in the median plane. Further preliminary preparation in depth and exploration of the thyroid isthmus. As this is only very small, it is only coagulated extensively and then cut. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Now open the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp. Preparation of a Björk flap. Then circular suturing of the tracheostoma and insertion of a size 7 tracheostomy tube after extubation of the patient. The patient is then repositioned for the TORS procedure. Insert the LARS blocker for this. Exposure of the epiglottis. Then perform an epiglottectomy from the base of the tongue. The incision is made with the monopolar over the plica pharyngoepiglottica backwards to the arya. Here, horizontal placement above the ary, taking along the tumor island located on the median surface. From here, resect endolaryngeally down to the pocket fold level. Here, the tumor is then deposited on the upper edge of the morgue sinus. The dissection is then continued ventrally. Then vertically split the epiglottis and initially remove the left part of the tumor up to the anterior commissure. The hemiepiglottectomy is then performed on the right side. Preservation of the pharyngoepiglottic plica. The entire ary appears not to be covered by the tumor. Therefore, only resection of the entire pocket fold up to the lower edge of the morgue sinus, the upper part of which also appears to be infiltrated by the tumor. From here, resection into the anterior commissure, where the tumor can be removed. The tumor is then resected in the area of the anterior commissure. This specimen is sent separately for histopathological examination. Now take marginal samples from the anterior commissure on the ary on the left side. The separate samples of the anterior commissure and the arytenoid region on the left are sent for frozen section diagnostics. The samples are found to be tumor-free by the pathologist. Therefore, after careful bleeding control, no further measures are taken. A nasogastric feeding tube is then inserted and the procedure is completed after removal of the Lars blocker. Initially nutrition via the nasogastric tube for the next 5 days. Then slowly build up oral nutrition depending on the tendency to aspirate. In a second session, neck dissection must be planned on both sides in 2-3 weeks. If the feeding is successful without aspiration, the tracheostoma can be closed during this session if necessary.","Supraglottische Kehlkopfteilresektion

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, indication for primary surgical procedure.","First, after preparation by the anesthesia colleagues, inspection of the primary tumor. An exulcerated tumor of the left soft palate with a depleted uvula was found. Submucosal infiltration of the soft palate approx. 1 cm with a pronounced small cone of just under 2 cm on the left. The submucosal lesion extends to the upper pole of the tonsil, the suspicious change extends to half of the left tonsil, otherwise the tumor can also be palpated. First of all, perform the PEG insertion. To do this, enter with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy advancement into the stomach. After excellent diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and placement of the PEG tube size 15 Charričre using the usual suture pull-through method. Subsequent repositioning for tumor resection, this is done transorally. Insertion of the tonsil plug, cutting around the tumor with a safety margin of just under 1 cm. Resection with monopolar needle and dissection technique. Subtotal resection of the soft palate on the left. Resection up to the upper tonsil pole on the right, left-sided removal of the anterior palatal arch and performance of a tonsillectomy in the area of the regular and unchanged capsule. Deposition at the base of the tongue with macroscopically inconspicuous conditions. Completely covering marginal samples are now taken both on the specimen and in situ. These are diagnosed as completely tumor-free in the frozen section diagnosis. Therefore, intraoperative R0 situation, meticulous hemostasis and measurement of the defect measuring up to 8 x 5.5 in total in dry wound conditions. If tongue swelling has already clearly set in after tumor resection, a shot tracheotomy is performed later. First turn to neck dissection of the left side. To do this, make a submandibular incision approx. 2 QF below the lower jaw, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the digasatric muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland, removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical sinus, the hypoglossal nerve, the facial vein and the superior thyroid artery. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and the upper level Va with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. The submandibular gland is excised later. Subcapsular procedure and preservation of the oral branch. The facial vein is later removed for reasons of space. Exposure and preservation of the facial artery initially, which is later also ligated and removed. Resection of the digastric muscle. Entering pharyngeally at the level of the caudal tonsil lobes. Widen the pharyngotomy up to a width of approx. 3 QF, finally wide and soft conditions for subsequent pedicle positioning. Turn to the neck dissection of the right side. Also corresponding to the opposite side, skin incision, cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical anus, the hypoglossal nerve, the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Dissection of the accessorius triangle and the upper level Va, carefully preserving the cervical plexus branches. Final inspection and, if conditions are dry, wound irrigation, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Now turn to lifting the radialis graft from the left forearm. After marking the graft, which measures 9 x 5.5 in total and has a special soft palate configuration, the tourniquet is applied. Cutting around the graft. Exposure and entrainment of the distal cephalic vein. Performing the Haydn maneuver. Identification of the ramus superficialis nervi radialis. Ulnar exposure of the musculature, strictly subfascial approach here. Identification of the distal vascular pedicle, removal of the vasa radialia after ligation, strictly subfascial preparation, the ulnar vascular nerve bundle is not exposed. Subfascial release of the graft and proximal dissection after exposure of the strong ulnar artery, isolation of the radial artery, exposure and preservation of the common interosseous artery, exposure of a narrow bridge between the cephalic vein and the deep venous drainage system, but with strong venous confluence here, the deep venous confluence is later prepared for primary anastomosis. Isolation of the veins. Reopening of the tourniquet with excellent flap vitality Careful hemostasis is performed on the graft and the forearm. There is better venous flow for the deep draining vein, therefore ligation of the cephalic vein. A monitor was not used as the graft was clearly visible. Subsequently, the vital graft was removed after ligation of the draining vessels. The graft was then removed, the wound carefully closed in two layers and the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the right groin was inserted. Then application of the vacuum-sealing dressing and application of the stretcher splint in the functional site. Removal of the full-thickness skin graft. To do this, mark the graft oval, lift a graft of approx. 11 x 5 cm, cut around the oval, strictly cutaneous lifting. Careful subcutaneous mobilization. Subsequent insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain with dry wound conditions and strong multi-layer wound closure. Subsequent skin suturing. The plastic tracheotomy was performed at the same time as the radialis graft removal. For this purpose, a horizontal skin incision was made at the level of the cricoid cartilage to separate the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature, separation of the musculature, exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, transection of the thyroid isthmus after ligation and repositioning. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap. Incision of the tracheostoma in the usual manner and subsequent problem-free reintubation to a size 9 low cuff cannula. After insertion of the graft from cervical to enoral, adaptive incision of the graft is performed, overall good fit, subsequent tightness on all sides. Left-sided positioning of the vascular pedicle. Conditioning of the flap vascular pedicle, followed by conditioning of the superior thyroid artery. Careful suturing of the arteries with 8.0 Ethilon. Due to the repositioning, the intake conditions were considerably more difficult, but subsequently the flow conditions were problem-free and sufficient and venous return was immediate and regular. Conditioning facial vein, which despite previous deposition ........ flow conditions. Measurement of a size 3.0 coupler and problem-free implementation of the venous anastomosis with the coupler, followed by good flow conditions and vital enoral graft, so that after final wound inspection, a 10-gauge Redon drain was inserted, careful two-layer wound closure and termination of the procedure with a vital graft and transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis with Unacid 3 g. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT2 cN0 oral cavity carcinoma on the left, abstinence from food initially for 7-8 days, then with regular enoral healing, gradual food build-up and decannulation with regular swallowing function.","Resection, Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

Adjustment of the pharynx with the laryngoscope. Insertion of the flexible esophagoscope. Advance into the stomach: inconspicuous conditions there. If diaphanoscopy is good, PEG insertion in the usual way using the thread pull-through method. No bleeding. Perioperative administration of Unacid. Please continue this for a few days postoperatively. Hypopharyngoscopy performed again: After adjustment with the small water tube, the tumor at the entrance in the hypopharynx on the left can be seen very clearly, which is relatively easy to move and can be pushed away from the arytenoid cartilage. Decision to perform a neck dissection on both sides with tracheotomy and lateral pharyngotomy with tumor extirpation. Repositioning of the patient and skin disinfection. Infiltration anesthesia in the area of the right and left side of the neck. Start on the left. Marking of a platysmal flap. Cut around the platysmal flap and dissect it as far as the submandibular gland. At the same time, perform the neck dissection, cutting through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle after dissection of the platysmal flap medially. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, the facial vein, which remains intact. Exposure, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve and the accessorius nerve. Exposure of the posterior digastric venter muscle. Dissection of the posterior neck preparation, first clearing level IIb, then continuing cranially to IV beginning V. After detachment and transection of the omohyoid muscle, finally transection of the fatty tissue and its supraclavicular transection. Removal of the posterior neck preparation. Now dissect anteriorly. Removal of the capsule of the submandibular gland. Exposure, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery and the superior laryngeal nerve. Preparation of the anterior neck specimen and also submission for definitive histology. Exposure of the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage and the posterior edge. Removal of the upper horn of the thyroid cartilage and detachment of the piriform sinus from the thyroid cartilage. Resection of part of the thyroid cartilage. Entering the pharynx. Perform a lateral pharyngotomy below the hyoid bone. The tumor can be clearly seen at the entrance to the hypopharynx. It is circumcised in a circular fashion while sparing the laryngeal structures. The arytenoid hump is clearly visible but remains intact and part of the mucosa of the arytenoid hump must also be removed. In some cases, resection of part of the aryepiglottic fold. Removal of circular margin samples. These are all found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. Due to the relatively circumscribed defect, it is not necessary to create a flap. The platysmal flap is therefore moved back later. A primary multi-layered wound closure of the mucosa is now performed. This is very successful. The thyroid gland is dissected caudally, set down at the caudal pole and swung upwards to additionally reinforce the pharynx on this side and is stitched directly onto the pharyngeal suture. Extensive hemostasis with bipolar coagulation and irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. No more bleeding. Insertion of a Redon drain. Repositioning of the platysmal flap.

On CT, the tumor extends to the internal carotid artery, which shows kinking here. The above-mentioned operation is therefore indicated.","First, pharyngoscopy again: The exophytic tumor in the area of the tonsil lobe with transition to the palatal arch is confirmed, smaller flat extensions caudally onto the lateral wall of the oropharynx and towards the posterior wall of the oropharynx are visible. Therefore indication for surgery confirmed. PEG insertion: insertion of the flexible esophagoscope. After creating the diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube in a typical manner without complications. Positioning of the patient. Skin disinfection. Injection of a total of 20 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. First start with radical neck dissection on the right: skin incision typically widened slightly caudally. Depiction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is infiltrated by lymph node metastases. Showing digastric muscle, omohyoid muscle. Depiction of the internal jugular vein, which is infiltrated cranially by the metastasis. Depiction of the common carotid artery, internal/external carotid artery. These can be dissected from the metastatic conglomerate. Depiction of the hypoglossal nerve. This must also be dissected. The nervus accessorius extends into the lymph node conglomerate and is also resected. Some branches of the cervical plexus, which are involved in the tumor, must also be resected in the cranial to middle area. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is removed caudally and cranially and also resected. Parts of the deep neck muscles in the cranial area must also be resected as they are also infiltrated. The internal jugular vein is removed caudally and cranially and ligated twice. However, the most caudal part of the internal jugular vein with an outgoing facial vein can be preserved for the vascular anastomosis. Vagus nerve border cords are exposed and preserved. Neck dissection on the left, performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Depiction of the omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein, internal/external carotid artery, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. All structures are visualized and preserved. Clearing from level II to V. This is also done while exposing and preserving all branches of the cervical plexus. Finally, careful hemostasis and wound closure in the typical manner with insertion of a Redon drain. Tracheostoma creation: Small Kocher collar incision. Dissection through subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature. This is split. Thyroid isthmus, which is very small, is dissected after bipolar coagulation. The anterior wall of the trachea is exposed. The trachea is opened in the 2nd to 3rd intercartilaginous space and a wide-based, modified Björk flap is created. This is epithelized in the typical manner. Subsequently, reintubation with insertion of a Woodbridge tube. Then tumor resection combined transorally and transcervically: The tumor is first removed macroscopically from all sides transorally at a distance of at least 1 cm. The anterior palatal arch is completely removed and parts of the posterior palatal arch are removed. The tumor is removed along the tonsil capsule, as this is a good boundary layer. Glossoalveolar groove, marginal parts of the base of the tongue and the pharyngeal side wall up to just before the entrance to the hypopharynx are also removed. Tumor specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section. Similarly, a marginal sample from the medial edge of the pharyngeal wall at the border to the posterior wall. This is also thread-marked and sent for final histology. Here, there are very narrow gaps in the basal direction, so that a resection is recommended. Carcinoma in situ infiltrates are also found in the middle section of the marginal specimen in the medial direction of the pharyngeal wall, so that a resection is also necessary here. For the resection, the internal/external carotid artery was previously dissected and the kinking of the internal carotid artery was also separated from the pharyngeal wall. All soft tissue is now removed from the inside of the lower jaw from the cranial side next to the palatal arch down to the hyoid bone. All soft tissue remaining from the pharyngeal tube is removed. A wide resection is also obtained from the medial pharyngeal wall, which is marked with sutures remote from the tumor. The soft tissue margin sample and the margin sample from the medial pharyngeal wall are sent to the frozen section again. Here, no further tumor infiltrates are visible in the soft tissues. Only moderate dysplasia on the pharyngeal wall, no carinoma in situ. Thus now an R0 situation. There is a defect from the palatal arch next to the uvula down to the piriform sinus entrance. As no radial flap is possible, a thigh flap is removed to cover the defect: Several perforators can be made out in the line from the superior spina to the lateral patella and these are marked. After measuring the size of the flap, the dimension is 13 x 8 mm. This flap size is marked around the perforators accordingly. First make a skin incision medially up to the fascia. Then cut through the fascia. Depiction of the rectus femoris muscle. Incision is extended slightly cranially, between rectus femoris and vastus lateralis to find the ramus descencus. However, this does not run directly next to the vastus lateralis but into the muscle at the lower edge of the vastus lateralis. Departure of several perforators can be observed. Separation of the vastus in the medius from the intermuscular septum. The vascular pedicle is followed distally. Here the vascular pedicle is deposited in the caudal region. Then make a skin incision on the lateral side up to the fascia. After cutting through the fascia, successive lifting of the flap with muscle cuff. This muscle cuff is slightly enlarged as the vessels run into it from the caudal instead of the lateral side. Successive lifting of the muscle. Branches of the femoral nerve to the muscles are all preserved as far as possible. Subsequent dissection of the vascular pedicle up to the entrance of the artery into the profunda femoral artery. Outgoing smaller arterial vessels are ligated or clipped. Two accompanying veins are also lifted, outgoing vessels are ligated or clipped. Cranially, a confluence is divided into three outgoing vessels in front of the entrance to the femoral profunda vein. After complete elevation of the flap including the pedicle, there is good pulsation in the area of the descending ramus and at least two of the outgoing perforators. Blood flow in the flap is regular. Subsequently, the artery, which is cut off cranially with 4.0 prolene sutures, is removed using the puncture technique. The smaller outgoing veins are ligated. The outlet from the profunda femoral vein is treated with 4.0 prolene sutures over and under the vein. After removal of the flap, irrigation with heparin. The wound on the thigh is closed in layers after extensive hemostasis. The fascia is also sutured. Wound closure with insertion of two Redon drains. Now suture the flap into the defect. The flap is inserted into the neck in such a way that excessive tension between the skin and muscle in relation to the perforators is avoided. Successive suturing of the flap into the defect using 3.0 Vicryl single-button sutures, which is partly done by advancing the sutures. The flap can be sutured into the defect with relatively little tension and in a three-dimensionally correct manner. The vessels are then trimmed for the vascular suture. The facial artery is selected. This is sutured to the descending ramus after widening the lumen of the facial artery using the fish-mouth technique with 8.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. Trimming of the veins. The facial vein, which opens caudally into the still open internal jugular vein, is selected. This is anastomosed with the confluent vessel from the profunda femoral vein. A coupler size 3.0 is selected for this purpose. After opening the arterial clamp, good venous return or after opening the veins, good venous return, smear phenomenon positive. However, pulsation via the perforators is relatively weak. ......... Control brings little reflux. Disturbance in the perforator area, e.g. spasm, cannot be ruled out with certainty, but pulsation via the anastomoses and the large vessels is regular. Further measures currently not advisable. Therefore now careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a flap. Skin closure on the left is also performed after hemostasis and insertion of a Redon drainage. Insertion of a size 8 tracheostomy tube, which is fixed with sutures. Completion of the procedure without complications. Overall cT2-3 tonsil/oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. cN2b status required radical neck dissection. Defect coverage by means of thigh flap from the right side. Circulatory situation uncertain at the end. Patient transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Here regular checks of flap perfusion according to schedule. Heparin perfusion, which was started intraoperatively at 500 units per hour, should be continued. Please continue antibiotics, which were started intraoperatively with Unacid, for one week. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube.

Therefore above mentioned surgery indicated.,"First induction of anesthesia by the anesthetist. Then bronchoscopic intubation by the anesthetist. This is very difficult as the large tumor masses almost completely obstruct the glottic plane. Ultimately, the patient can be intubated transnasally by bronchoscopy. Then we enter with the Kleinsasser tube and inspect the hypopharyngeal and laryngeal areas. Another detailed inspection of the tumor. As already described, the tumor begins at the lower tonsil pole, moves down the lateral pharyngeal wall and infiltrates the lateral and medial wall of the piriform sinus. However, the tip of the piriform sinus is free. Then infiltration of the postcricoid region and the pocket fold region in the right laryngeal region. Then placement of a feeding tube and sterile washing and draping. Start with the creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Then perform a modified radical neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the omohyoid muscle. Locating the accessorius nerve. This is difficult, as there are several large metastases in the area of level II a and b, which are first carefully detached. These can be dissected away from the jugular vein although they are directly attached to it. Dissection of the entire internal jugular vein. Removal of the remaining level II a and b. Levels III, IV and V are still covered with hard, rough metastases. These metastases are also located between the plexus branches and some plexus branches unfortunately have to be sacrificed in order to cleanly remove the metastases. The vagus nerve and border cord can be spared. The metastases themselves are directly adjacent to the internal and common carotid arteries, but can be easily dissected away from them. Then perform neck dissection level VI. Release the hyoid bone from the left side. Dissect the cervical vascular sheath on the right side of the larynx and hypopharynx. Skeletonization of the larynx. Separation of the entire laryngeal musculature. Exposure of the pharynx directly above the hyoid. Performing a pharyngotomy and extracting the epiglottis. Clamping of the epiglottis and cutting around the tumor with a sufficient safety distance, taking the hyoid bone with it. In the area of the pharyngeal side wall on the right, the tumor is resected, but with a very small safety margin, so a marginal sample is immediately taken again and sent for a frozen section. Fortunately, no tumor cells, no carcinoma in situ or higher-grade dysplasia. Further exploration of the larynx along the postcricoid region. First release of the thyroid gland and free preparation of the trachea. Entering the trachea and performing a tracheotomy. Performing a mucocutaneous anastomosis in the lower region. Re-intubation. Then return to the laryngeal preparation. The larynx is completely released along the postcricoid region and the cricoid cartilage. Separation of the larynx from the posterior wall of the trachea. The posterior wall of the trachea is cut upwards like a flap. The entire laryngeal preparation is sent to the frozen section marked with a suture. The pathologist is unable to detect carcinoma in situ, inverse carcinoma or high-grade dysplasia at the edges. Now the myotomy is performed. For this, the esophageal entrance and the esophagus are opened digitally and the constrictor muscles are cut with sharp scissors so that ultimately only the mucosa remains. The myotomy is performed posteromedially as usual. The lower attachments of the sternocleidomastoid muscle are then incised to create a flatter stoma. This is performed on both sides using the monopolar knife. After securing the R0 resection, elevation of the left forearm flap. Marking of the flap in a size of approx. 9 x 6 cm. Marking of a skin monitor. Subsequent resection of the flap from the ulnar side. Preparation of a subcutaneous bridge to the skin monitor on both sides. The incision is extended to the crook of the elbow. Then locate the superficial venous system. Integration into the subcutaneous bridge to the skin monitor. The flap is then lifted from the lateral side. Exposure of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. Distal clamping of the radial artery. Saturation always at 98 to 100 %. After approx. 15 minutes with good saturation, the artery is removed. This is ligated proximally distally with 4-0 Prolene. Then lift the flap subfascially. Smaller vessels are coagulated bipolar or treated with clips. Exposure and connection between the superficial and deep venous system in the antecubital region. Exposure of the radial artery. Clamping of the interosseous artery. If good saturation is maintained, closure of the. Interosseous artery using clips. Two good venous outlets from the cephalic vein can be visualized. Removal of the flap. Veins are ligated. The artery is closed in the entry area into the brachial artery using 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Then flush the flap with Ringer's solution. Before insertion of the flap, a left myotomy is performed in the typical manner. Complete transection of the muscle fibers. Esophageal wall is opened slightly distally at the entrance area to ensure greater passage. Provox prosthesis cannot be used primarily due to the overall situation. Flap is successively incorporated into the defect with 3-0 Vicryl single-button sutures. Tension-free closure. Stem is placed to the right. Conditioning of the radial artery and the superior thyroid artery. Suture with 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. Opening of the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. Two branches of the cephalic vein are selected for the anastomosis. The radial vein is clipped. One end of the cephalic vein is easily clipped to an outlet of the facial vein after selecting a 3-0 coupler. After opening the clamp, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The other part of the cephalic vein is coupled with the external jugular vein using a 3-0 coupler; here too, good venous return after opening the clamp, positive smear phenomenon. Subsequent careful irrigation of the wound area. Hemostasis. Wound closure in layers and placement of a Redon drain on each side, epithelialization of the tracheostoma and insertion of the skin monitor via a small transverse skin incision at the upper edge of the right apron incision. A 10 mm tracheostomy tube is then inserted and secured with sutures. In the thigh area, a piece of 0.8 mm split skin is removed in the corresponding size of the defect. Hydrogel dressing is applied to the thigh area. The forearm is primarily closed in the cranial area. In the caudal area, the defect is covered by suturing the removed split skin. Hydrogel-Mepilex dressing is then applied. Loose compresses are applied on top. Wrapping with absorbent cotton. Fitting of a Cramer splint in functional position. Wrap with elastic bandage. Arm always well saturated until the end. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Insertion of Redon drains, one per side. Fixation of the Redon drain on the inside of the anastomosis, otherwise on the outside as usual. Two-layer wound closure and completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis in the tracheostoma area. Insertion of a tracheal cannula. Fixation by suturing the tracheostomy tube and completion of the procedure without complications. Please continue antibiotics, which were started intraoperatively with Unacid, for at least 2-3 days. Feeding via the PEG tube that was placed during the last operation for at least 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Flap control via skin monitoring or using a Doppler probe for 5 days. Continue heparin perfusor 500 E/hour for 5 days. Total cT4 cN2b hypopharyngeal carcinoma with invasion of the right laryngeal skeleton. Discuss postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy versus radiochemotherapy according to the histologic findings.","LE with partial pharyngectomy, Modified radical neck dissection Level II-V, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

Furthermore, the tumor extends caudally along the lateral wall of the oropharynx and infiltrates the base of the tongue and extends to the vallecula. The vallecula itself is free. The epiglottis, hypopharynx and larynx are also free. Due to the location and size of the tumor, a decision was made to resect the tumor and cover the defect with a radialis graft.","Induction of anesthesia and transnasal intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. First, tumor resection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: The exophytic tumor is seen, which is located in the area of the tonsillar lobe, extends over the glossoalveolar groove to the base of the tongue, also runs towards the soft palate, but does not quite reach the border of the posterior palatal arch; the tumor extends caudally to below the tonsillar lobe. Now insertion of retractors or McIvor oral flaps alternately and suturing of the tongue. The tumor is successively incised macroscopically with a safety margin of at least 1 to 1.5 cm. Resection covers the posterior palate, anterior palate, lowest parts of the buccal mucosa at the border to the alveolar ridge, further along or above the alveolar ridge in the anterior direction, then via the glossoalveolar groove into the base of the tongue. Dorsocaudally, the resection extends over the posterior palatal arch to the adjacent pharyngeal side wall and finally just in front of the hypopharynx towards the base of the tongue and floor of the mouth. The floor of the mouth is also resected in the dorsal parts. The lingual nerve is located in the resection area and is also resected, as are the dorsal parts of the sublingual gland. The uppermost parts of the submandibular gland are also included in the preparation. Craniobasally, the resection extends in depth to the styloid process, which is exposed and the tumor is successively resected, taking the entire pterygoid musculature with it. The carotid artery is still palpable under the styloid process or under a thin soft tissue sheath and is not directly exposed. Finally, the entire tumor is removed and suture-marked in a typical manner. A marginal sample is taken cranially from the soft palate to the border of the alveolar ridge and also thread-marked. In addition, a marginal sample is taken anteriorly, which is also thread-marked and extends from the edge of the tongue to the alveolar ridge along the floor of the mouth. In the frozen section, despite ample safety margins of 1 to 1.5 cm, there are still in situ infiltrates or moderate to high-grade dysplasia in the area of the palatal arch, base of the tongue and along the alveolar ridge. Therefore, another marginal sample is taken medially on the pharynx with suture markings, as well as a marginal sample from the palate to the alveolar ridge with markings remote from the tumor and a marginal sample from the tongue area medially including caudal to the base of the tongue, also with suture markings here. Also a marginal sample from the alveolar ridge anterior lateral. No evidence of higher-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma in the marginal samples taken. Similarly, no carcinoma in the marginal samples taken at the beginning, also no invasive carcinoma or higher-grade dysplasia. Therefore, surgical R0 resection, although there is a suspicion that there may be a tendency towards field cancerization. Then perform PEG placement through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> using the suture pull-through method. This is easily possible with good diaphanoscopy. Then sterile washing and draping and initial removal of the left arm. Perform the neck dissection on the right side through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. To do this, incise the skin in the usual way. Expose the borders. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Showing the digastric muscle. Showing the cervical vascular sheath. Showing the hypoglossal and accessorius nerve. Exposure of the cervical sinus. Clearing of the neck levels IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Insertion of a Redon drainage and two-layer wound closure. Then tracheotomy performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. For this, vertical skin incision, exposure of the pretracheal musculature. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Creation of a visor tracheotomy between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis. Then neck dissection on the left side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Incision in the usual manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and hypoglossus. Clearing of neck levels IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Then removal of the submandibular gland on the left side, which was already partially resected during the tumor resection and creation of a 3 QF wide tunnel to the inside of the mouth. Parallel to this, lift the radialis graft from the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>: mark the flap in the appropriate size and three-dimensional configuration, also in the direction of the pedicle. Then first lift the radial flap from the ulnar side and extend the incision cranially. Identification of the superficial venous system and the deep flap pedicle. Then recut the flap also from the radial side. This is done under constant pulse oximeter control, no special features here. The flap is also perfused. Then locate the pedicle. Deposition of the pedicle. This is treated distally and cranially with 4-0 Prolene puncture ligatures. The flap is then lifted along the pedicle in the typical manner, the outgoing vessels or outgoing vessels from the musculature are clipped successively. Dissection of the pedicle up to the crook of the elbow. Here the cephalic vein with 2 good outlets as well as a good confluence and the radial artery can be dissected. It can be seen that the radial artery graft is no longer perfused. Then puncture in the skin area. There is no blood flow and no detectable pulse signal in the area of the flap by Doppler sonography, only the proximal 2/3 of the flap stalk is still detectably perfused by Doppler sonography. The flap is then immediately warmed with warm cloths. As the flap still showed good perfusion in the proximal pedicle area, the decision was made to anastomose it arterially at the neck. Now anastomosis between the radial artery and the superior thyroid artery through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The thyroid artery showed very good blood flow. Unfortunately, even now there was no graft perfusion and there was also no vernal return flow. Especially spasm of the flap. As a last resort, the flap was placed in a solution of lidocaine, sodium bicarbonate and nitroglycerin and later sprayed again with nitrospray. When these measures proved ineffective, the decision was made to remove the flap and perform an endoscopy of the radial artery with a 0.8 mm endoscope from proximal and distal. Overall unclear situation. Explanation by the scar described by the patient, which was described as a superficial injury, not sufficient. Filiform openings are found at the upper entrance to the flap. In this case, anomaly of the vessel or consequence of an injury. A major trauma is not known from the anamnesis and was not described by the patient when asked. Nonetheless, there is evidence of insufficient flap perfusion at the upper border of the flap or at the upper edge of the flap where the artery enters. At the site of the filiform vascular drawings, the artery is now dissected out in the fatty tissue. It can also be seen here that the artery is lost in filiform, smaller vessel lumina. This means that the blood supply to the flap in this region is interrupted. The forearm is closed in a typical manner using split skin from the right thigh. Due to the defect, the only remaining option is to elevate the radial flap on the opposite side in order to cover the defect in an adequate, three-dimensional and areal dimension. Therefore, after covering the right side of the arm, lift the radialis flap from the right: Here too, after marking the flap, proceed in the same way as on the opposite side. As on the opposite side, a superficial venous system and the connection to the deep venous system as well as the deep vascular system of the flap pedicle can be visualized. Here too, first dissection from the ulnar, then from the radial side. Here too, the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve is preserved as on the opposite side. Separation of the flap distally with puncture ligation, as on the opposite side, and dissection cranially with supply of the outgoing vessels using clips or bipolar or ligature. At the end, 2 cephalic veins and a good radial artery. After removal of the flap, the veins are supplied with ligatures. The artery is supplied via puncture ligatures. Blood flow to the hand is always very good until the end with saturation values of 99 to 100 %. Very good blood supply to the flap. Ample irrigation of the flap pedicle with heparin solution. No special features here either. Subsequent closure of the forearm with split skin from the right thigh. The graft from the right side is regularly perfused and completely unremarkable. The graft is then removed, rinsed with heparin and prepared for insertion into the oropharynx. The tunnel must be widened slightly for this, as there is not yet sufficient visibility from the transcervical side into the defect. Suturing is almost impossible as the tongue and cheek area are extremely swollen and the patient already has a very small mouth opening. Therefore, the graft is first sutured to the soft palate and to the lateral wall of the oropharynx from the transoral side and the rest from the transcervical side in the area of the medial pharyngeal wall and around the base of the tongue. Then turn the graft over and suture in the area of the alveolar ridge and the floor of the mouth again from the transoral side. Then prepare the facial artery to attach the graft, which had already been ligated beforehand. The flow is very good. Anastomosis with the facial artery and a stump of the internal jugular vein to the deep flap vein and then anastomosis between the facial artery stump and the cephalic vein. Positioning of the pedicle. Fixation of the pedicle with Gelita. Insertion of a Penrose drain and two-layer wound closure, completion of the procedure. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Wait for histology and presentation of the patient at the tumor conference. A blue swallow can be performed clinically from the 10th postoperative day. An X-ray pre-swallow is not necessary.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy, PEG placement

The patient had again had swallowing problems for about six months and an exophytic tumor in the right hypopharyngeal-laryngeal region. Hence the indication for the above procedure.","Induction of anesthesia by anesthesia colleagues. Intubation by the anesthetist. First of all, entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the tumor region. An exophytic tumor is seen, starting in the tonsil loge on the right side, moving caudally, infiltrating the piriform sinus in the entrance area on the hypopharyngeal side wall. The tip of the piriform sinus is free, the tumor extends at the aryepiglottic fold onto the arytenoid cartilage on the right side. The endolarynx itself is free, but postradiogenically altered. Repositioning and placement of a PEG tube using the thread pull-through method. This is successful with good diaphanoscopy. No abnormalities in the esophagus and stomach area. Sterile washing and draping. Creation of an apron flap. However, this is only prepared up to the level of the hyoid bone in order to keep the neck opening as small as possible. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. This is very difficult on both sides as the patient has been pre-operated and pre-irradiated. The entire tissue is fibrotically altered and massively scarred. Skeletonization of the larynx with separation of the infrahyal musculature. Exposure of the hyoid bone. Detachment of the thyroid gland on both sides. Release of the piriform sinus on the left side. This cannot be done on the right side due to the tumor. Entering the pharynx on the right side. Disluxation of the epiglottis and inspection of the tumor region. The tumor appears as described above, starting at the tonsil lobe on the right side and extending caudally. First, release the laryngeal region from the pharynx on the right side. Cut around the tumor region with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm. The tumor extends to the esophageal entrance and can be placed there together with the laryngeal preparation. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section. The frozen section still shows parts of carcinoma in situ at the entrance to the oesophagus. A large resection specimen is taken here and another marginal specimen is taken for frozen section. Final R0 situation. Lifting the radial artery graft from the left. The radialis graft is 15x9 cm in size, as almost the entire pharynx has to be reconstructed. Only a narrow strip remained. Marking of the graft. Incision around the skin island and extension of the incision on the forearm. Depiction of the brachialis muscle. Exposure of the cephalic vein and other superficial veins. Exposure of the venous star in the crook of the elbow with exploration of the venous confluence between the superficial and deep venous system. Finding the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. This is divided into three branches. All three branches can be dissected and pushed laterally so that they do not have to be integrated into the graft. Locating the radial artery. Ligation and removal of the radial artery. Exposure of the tendons. Lifting the graft from the tendons. It is clear that the radial artery is massively calcified and looks like a rigid calcareous tube in large parts. Despite this, the graft is well perfused throughout the entire preparation time and the hand is also monitored by pulse oximetry and is also completely perfused with over 90% oxygen saturation. The stem is prepared in the usual way. The graft is placed in the crook of the elbow so that two veins are present. One from the superficial system and one from the deep system. The graft is sutured into the pharynx, starting in the tonsil lobe, down to the esophageal entrance. The esophageal entrance is reconstructed using a pointed Z-plasty. This is achieved by advancing the sutures. A Provox prosthesis was previously inserted in the usual way using the pull-through method. The oesophagus is easily passable digitally, so that a myotomy is not necessary. Perform a myotomy in the area of the sternocleidomastoid on both sides. The superior thyroid artery is used for the anastomosis of the radial artery graft for the venous limb. This works without any problems. Use of a coupler for the venous anastomosis, once to the superior thyroid vein and once to a more caudal outlet vessel from the internal jugular vein. Reconstruction of the tracheostoma. Insertion of a flap on the anastomosis side and insertion of a Redon drainage on the opposite side. Two-layer wound closure. Insertion of a tracheostomy tube, suturing of a tracheostomy tube. Completion of the procedure without complications. A nasogastric tube was placed intraoperatively.

CT shows deep growth in the soft tissues, reaching the level of the hyoid bone and also the lateral left laryngeal skeleton, therefore the above-mentioned operation is indicated.","First of all, pharyngoscopy again after positioning the head: The exophytic tumor can be seen, which is massively located at the described site. Mucosa in the area of the arytenoid fold on the left and postcricoid area edematously thickened. Indication for surgery confirmed. Flap cover with platysmal flap or radial flap probable. Initially in further positioning of the patient. Injection of the corresponding surgical regions and sterile draping after skin disinfection of all regions relevant to the operation. Initially start with an apron flap, which is extended to the left latero-caudally in order to cover the defect with a platysmal flap if necessary. Lift this apron flap subplatysmally in the area of the platysma with underlying fatty tissue on the left side. The external jugular artery is ligated and taken along, paying particular attention to the venous outlets, especially connections to the external jugular vein, anterior jugular vein and facial vein. The apron flap is raised on both sides to the level of the submandibular gland or the level of the hyoid bone. Then neck dissection on the left: Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle anterior border and dissection of the fat lymph node package. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein. Exposure of the internal carotid artery, externa. Exposure of the vagus nerve border cord, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Subsequent evacuation level II to V with visualization of the branches of the cervical plexus which are preserved as far as possible. Subsequent tumor resection via lateral pharyngotomy. Pushing the hypoglossal nerve cranially. Push off the cervical vascular sheath laterally, ligation of the lingual artery. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery and pushing the thyroid gland in the upper pole latero-caudally. Exposure of the pharyngeal tube. Tumor can be felt massively next to the thyroid cartilage or on the thyroid cartilage. Insertion next to the epiglottis. Expose the tumor successively, cut around the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1.5-2 cm on all sides. The lateral part of the aryepiglottic fold falls caudally to the piriform sinus, medially to the posterior pharyngeal wall and cranially to the beginning of the tonsillar lobe, in each case the entire diameter of the pharyngeal wall. The thyroid cartilage is resected paramedian to the left and just above the beginning of the cricoid cartilage. The specimen is removed and marked with sutures. Carcinoma in situ or small foci, in this case infiltrates, are still recognizable in 2 places in the area of the arytenoid fold and in the area of the base of the tongue to the posterior pharyngeal wall despite the wide resection distance. Therefore, resection of a strip of mucosa at least 1 cm wide from the base of the tongue over the posterior pharyngeal wall to the transition to the piriform sinus. The specimen is marked with sutures away from the tumor. Further resection with removal of the mucosa in the area of the aryepiglottic fold, also a good cm wide up to the entrance to the piriform sinus. Here too, suture markings remote from the tumor. In the frozen section now at most low to moderate grade dysplasia, no carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma. Therefore now R0 resection. Neck dissection is now performed on the right side. Here too, removal of levels II to IV as well as parts of 5. Exposure of the structures as on the opposite side. All structures are also preserved as far as possible, especially the vessels. Then tracheostoma creation: The infrahyoid muscles are cut caudally. The thyroid isthmus is then passed underneath, clamped, severed and supplied by means of puncture ligatures. Exposure of the trachea . Wide pedicled modified Björk flap. Epithelialization of this initially caudally. Re-intubation and insertion of an 8 mm Woodbridge tube. The radial flap is removed: After measuring the size of the defect, the flap size is just under 11 x just under 7 cm. Marking on the forearm. Curved skin incision up to the crook of the elbow. First release the flap from the ulnar side while protecting the ulnar artery. Flap elevation subfascially. Subsequent cranial exposure of the superficial vascular system, which remains intact. Subsequent incision of the radialis flap from radial, subfascial. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. After clamping the radial artery, remove it caudally and ligate. Then lift the flap subfascially with the vascular pedicle. Smaller vessels are bipolarly coagulated or supplied with clips. A variation then becomes apparent in the further course. The radial artery runs under the pronator teres muscle a little further caudally into the brachial artery. The confluence runs under the muscle in the direction of the superficial venous system, which runs above the muscle to the crook of the elbow. Decision to separate the superficial venous system from the deep one after a good confluence could be visualized below the pronator teres muscle. A. radialis is visualized at the entrance to the A. brachialis; the A. interossea, which is first clamped off, is first removed. Saturation at 100 % in each case. Deposition of the interosseous artery. Separation of the brachial artery at the entrance to the brachial artery. Treatment of the site of detachment with 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Subsequent stable saturation in the forearm area. Subsequent removal of the confluence below the pronator teres muscle and removal of the superficial veins with 2 connection options with splitting of the cephalic vein. The veins are ligated cranially. Flap pedicle is flushed with heparin via the superficial deep vein system and via the artery and preserved. Subsequent closure of the forearm defect: A piece of split skin is removed from the thigh area, thickness 07 to 08 mm. The thigh area is treated with a hydrocolloid dressing. Split skin is successively worked into the skin defect. The cranial skin wound is closed in layers. Subsequent octenidine-Mepilex dressing. Loose cloud dressing. Loose absorbent cotton dressing on loosely inserted compresses. Then fit Cramer splint and fix splint with tape bandage. Saturation on the forearm or thumb area always at 100%. Subsequent suturing of the flap into the defect: Radialis flap is inserted into the defect in such a way that the flap stem can be passed through a tunnel underneath the infrahyoid muscles to the opposite side. Successive suturing of the flap into the defect using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures without tension. Flap is sutured to the remaining thyroid cartilage or laterally to the remains of the previously resected hyoid bone on the left. The epiglottis is not included in the suture so that it remains mobile. Complete tension-free closure. The flap pedicle is then passed underneath the infrahyoid muscles to the opposite side. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery, which can be anastomosed with 9.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and good venous return. The confluent vein is anastomosed to a facial vein with 2.5 couplers. Here too, after opening the clamps, good venous flow, positive smear phenomenon. Next, anastomosis of an outlet of the cephalic vein with the external jugular vein via 3.5 couplers. Here too, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The remaining outlet is treated close to the outlet using clips. Subsequent careful irrigation of all regions in the neck area. Hemostasis. Insertion of a Redon drain on both sides, guided on the right. Successive layer-by-layer skin closure with incision of the apron flap with epithelialization of the tracheostoma. The skin in the area of the pre-platysmal flap was somewhat livid during the operation and was therefore not used to cover the defect, but had recovered by the end of the operation. Overall, radial flap coverage was indicated due to the size of the defect. Finally, insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula, which is fixed with sutures. The procedure was completed without complications. Doppler signals and flap perfusion normal. Patient goes to intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please elevate to 30°. Heparin perfusor 500 E/hour which was started intraoperatively please continue postoperatively for 5 days. Regular checks of the flap via transoral inspection or Doppler signals according to the scheme. Antibiotics started intraoperatively should be continued postoperatively with Unacid for approx. 1 week. Overall hypopharyngeal carcinoma with invasion into the lateral laryngeal region. Therefore, in addition to the hyoid bone on the left, thyroid cartilage on the left was also resected. Overall, however, a larynx-preserving procedure was possible and defect coverage using a radial flap was indicated. Postoperative presentation in the interdisciplinary tumor conference according to the histological findings. Nutrition via the inserted PEG tube. On the 10th postoperative day, gruel swallowing and, if necessary, diet build-up. Due to the position of the tube and the resection, protracted dysphagia is to be expected, therefore early initiation of swallowing therapy or swallowing rehabilitation.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Free flap (Radial)

Then insertion of a tonsillectomy tube and inspection of the tumor region. A large, exophytic tumor mass was found, starting from the tonsil on the right side, passing over to the soft palate up to the uvula and the base of the tongue. Start with transoral tumor resection in the area of the soft palate with a safety margin of more than 1 cm. Then successive tumor resection including the entire anterior palatal arch and the largest part of the posterior palatal arch and a small part of the base of the tongue on the right side. The tumor must be resected far to the side so that fatty tissue from the neck is already visible in the lateral oropharyngeal side wall. However, there is still no fistula, but the border to the soft tissue of the neck can no longer be guaranteed. Due to the large extent of the tumor resection, the lack of a soft palate and the expected fistula laterally into the soft tissues of the neck, the decision was made to cover the defect with a radialis graft. Initially, the neck dissection was performed on the left side, as it was not possible to assess whether the internal jugular vein could really remain intact on the right side. For this purpose, the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland were exposed. Then exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, dissection of the internal jugular vein, which can be completely preserved. Then expose the facial nerve and the lingual nerve of the superior thyroid artery and release the neck preparation IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the internal jugular and facial veins. Exposure of the submandibular gland, removal of the submandibular gland. Dissection of the digastric muscle. Release of the neck preparation IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. There is also a very large lymph node conglomerate on this side, which extends from level II to level IV; this could be integrated into the neck preparation and removed without destroying the vessels and nerves. Parallel to the neck dissection on the left side, the radialis graft is lifted, here for marking the graft on the forearm, cutting around the graft and extending the skin incision into the elbow. Exposure of the venous star in the elbow, showing the superficial and deep venous system with dissection of the confluence. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Exposure of the radial artery, clamping and cutting of the radial artery under pulsoxymetric control. Here 100% saturation in the left hand. Lift the graft from the veins in the usual manner, then dissect the stem up to the elbow and place the graft, taking one superficial and one deep vein with it. The transoral suturing of the transplant in the oropharynx is then very difficult, as the tongue, the uvula and the entire mucous membrane in the pharynx are already very swollen. In some cases, the graft has to be sutured into the lower area via the oropharyngotomy performed during the neck dissection. Finally, it is possible to fit the graft without tension, so that it does not tear out in the soft palate area, then repositioning to perform the anastomosis. First preparation and preparation of the superior thyroid artery. However, it turns out that there is hardly sufficient flow in the superior thyroid artery and the entire vessel is far too small to anastomose. Then turn to the lingual artery. Same problem here. Then search for the laryngeal artery, which is surprisingly relatively large and also has sufficient blood flow. Therefore, use the laryngeal artery to perform the anastomosis in the arterial area and then perform the venous anastomosis with an accompanying vein of the facial vein and the facial vein itself. The blood supply to the graft is good. Then insertion of a flap on the right side and insertion of a Redon drainage on the left side and two-layer wound closure. A tracheotomy was performed beforehand in the usual manner. This involved cutting the thyroid isthmus and performing a visor tracheotomy without a Björk flap between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage, creating a mucocutaneous anastomosis and reintubation with a tracheostomy tube. Continue antibiotics for 24 hours. The patient goes to the intensive care unit overnight and is allowed to wake up the next morning. Then nutrition via the existing PEG tube for 10 days, followed by an x-ray and food preparation.","Tumor resection, Modified radical neck dissection bilateral, Defect coverage (Radial), Tracheotomy

Representative samples are now taken in the area of the supraglottis, the anterior commissure and the epiglottis. These are assessed as tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Finally, dry wound conditions. Now turn to neck dissection on both sides: start with the right side. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. Skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and auricular nerve. Dissection of the transversus colli nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the facial vein. Preservation of the facial vein and visualization of the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation while sparing the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Several lymph nodes measuring up to 1.5 cm, but not macroscopically suspicious, are visible in the area of the jugulo-facial angle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the cervical and caudal plexus without evidence of lymph leakage. Final wound inspection. Wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and turning to the opposite side. Same procedure here in principle. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. Incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cutting through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Creation of a platysmal flap. Exposure of the auricularis magnus nerve. An external jugular vein is not pronounced here. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A coarse mass measuring approx. 4 x 3 cm can now be easily palpated in levels II to III, which is still relatively easy to move, therefore the standard procedure continues. Dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exclusion of an infiltration. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digasatric muscle. Visualization of the facial vein, which runs directly towards the metastasis, which is located cranial to the jugulofacial angle. Therefore, the facial vein is removed. Clearing out the anterior neck preparation while exposing and protecting the superior artery. The cervical artery moves directly towards the metastasis and is taken along. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Subsequent free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Successive detachment from the metastasis. Exposure and dissection of the common carotid artery. The metastasis is directly overlying here, but is still separated from it by a broad layer of connective tissue. The metastasis extends as far as the hypoglossal nerve, but certainly does not infiltrate it. After free preparation of the internal jugular vein from the perivascular tissue, the metastasis can also be easily separated here. Overall, no evidence of perinodal growth, well encapsulated mass, furthermore several lymph nodes measuring up to approx. 2 cm in level II and III that are not necessarily suspicious. After complete visualization of the accessorius nerve, evacuation of the accessorius triangle and evacuation of level V with careful protection of the plexus branches and final check for lymph leakage. Subsequently dry conditions. Now a new discussion of the findings with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Plastic tracheostomy is now recommended, but no further measures are taken. Therefore, after wound irrigation of the left side, final wound inspection of both sides of the neck, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drainage tube and careful two-layer wound closure. The tracheotomy was then performed. To do this, make a horizontal skin incision below the cricoid cartilage and cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature, ligation of the anterior right jugular vein, exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea, the thyroid isthmus is relatively weak here and is coagulated in a bipolar fashion. Further visualization of the anterior surface of the trachea. Entry between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap, smoothing of the tracheostoma edges with the conchotome and subsequent suturing of the tracheostoma and subsequent problem-free reintubation on an 8 mm tracheoflex cannula. Finally, enoral wound inspection with the Kleinsasser tube. Here the wound conditions were clear with moderate glottic edema. Dry conditions on all sides, so the procedure was ended at this point. Conclusion: This was a cT2 cN2a G2 supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma on the left, which was resected intraoperatively R0 in conjunction with the resection and the representative marginal samples. Due to the clear lymph node metastasis, adjuvant therapy is certainly indicated postoperatively. Postoperative abstinence from food for at least 3 days, after which the patient can be given a liquid diet depending on swallowing function and, depending on the development of swallowing function, can be decannulated during the inpatient stay. The patient received intraoperative single-shot antibiotics with Unacid 3 g and a single dose of 250 mg SDH.","Neck dissection and laser resection

Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery was indicated after panendoscopy and CT with contrast medium.","Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Sterile washing and draping of the neck area and performance of a tracheotomy by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Transverse skin incision for this, which can later be extended to form an apron flap. Exposure of the musculature. Splitting of the musculature in the midline. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Entering the trachea between the second and third tracheal cartilages. Intubation onto an LE tube. Sterile washing and draping. Applying an apron flap in the usual manner and performing neck dissection in parallel on the right and left. Neck dissection on the left: This shows a huge metastasis in level II infiltrating the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein, the hypoglossal nerve and the accessory nerve and parts of the cervical plexus as well as the marginal ramus of the oral branch and also parts of the lower pole of the parotid gland. First expose the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid, then the omohyoid and the submandibular gland. Insertion of a blocker and exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Then dissection of the cervical vascular sheath up to the tumor. Separation of the internal jugular vein. Removal of most of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Separation of the digastric muscle, which is also infiltrated. Severing of the hypoglossus, which is also drawn into the metastasis. It can now be seen that the external parotid artery is also being drawn into the metastasis. Showing the internal carotid artery. This can be completely detached from the metastasis. Separation of the external carotid artery and removal of the neck specimen including the metastasis. The left side is therefore not suitable for performing a flap connection. Neck dissection on the right side, after creation of the apron flap: Dissection of the skin platysmal flap sharply with the scalpel. The jugular vein is exposed, ligated, cut and dissected further cranially and preserved. Dissection along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in depth. The accessorius nerve is now exposed and spared. The accessor nerve is followed further cranially and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle is now also visible. Further medially, the submandibular gland can be seen, which is also easily visualized. The omohyoid muscle can be seen caudally. This shows the borders of the neck dissection. The cervical vascular sheath is visible in the depth below the neck preparation. The internal jugular vein is exposed from caudal to cranial. There is no injury to the structures here. The superior thyroid vein and facial vein are dissected and spared. Medial to the jugular vein, the common carotid artery, the external carotid artery, the vagus nerve and the cervical artery are exposed. The neck preparation is now detached in level II b. Level II a follows, sparing the accessorius nerve. Levels III/IV and V are also detached without difficulty. The plexus branches are visualized and specifically spared. No chyle fistula occurs caudally when the neck preparation is removed. The anterior neck preparation is now also exposed and dissected along the facial vein and the superior thyroid vein. Clinical cN0 neck status. The tumor is now resected from the transcervical area, but half of the hyoid bone must also be resected. The tumor is incised around the edge of the tongue, then in the base of the tongue, then dislocated cervically and the rest is dissected out here. The tumor is placed on a cork and then cut out as a whole. All edges are tumor-free. Moderate dysplasia at the base of the tongue. This is resected again with a corresponding margin sample. Both are sent for final histology. Then measurement of the defect and preparation of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. In the meantime, dissection of the vessels on the right side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. There is a well-branched facial vein and a slightly deeper outlet from the internal jugular vein that is well suited for venous vascular connection. The superior thyroid artery is then dissected, which could serve as an arterial vascular connection. Enter with the flexible gastroesophagoscope and insertion of the PEG through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Entering with the gastroesophagoscope and, with air insufflation, pre-scanning into the stomach. Once in the stomach, endoscopy of the cardia after inversion of the endoscope. A spontaneous diaphanoscopy is now seen. A PEG is now placed in loco typico on the left paramedian anterior wall of the stomach using the suture pull-through method. This was performed without any problems. The patient received Unacid 3 g i.v. perioperatively. Measurement of the defect and the three-dimensional configuration. The resulting flap size is 14-15 x 10 cm, with one end becoming two-cornered. Now radial flap elevation. Mark the flap on the left forearm. Then first make an ulnar incision and extend the incision in the crook of the elbow. Elevation of the flap from the ulnar side. Then expose the superficial venous system and the connection to the deep venous system. Two cephalic veins can be dissected first. Cut around the flap radially. This is lifted subfascially as well as ulnarly, leaving tissue on the fascia. The lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve is exposed and preserved. The radial artery is then exposed. After adequate clamping time, whereby the saturation here was constantly at 100 %, this is removed, cut and treated using 4.0 prolene sutures. Lift the flap subfascially along the pedicle. This must be separated by the brachioradialis muscle. Smaller vessels are clipped or supplied with bipolar. A confluence with two larger ends is also prepared in the area where the radial artery enters the brachial artery. This is removed, theoretically leaving two ends for the anastomosis. The veins are then removed and ligated proximally. The artery is removed and treated using 6.0 Vascufil single-button sutures. Removal of the flap and irrigation with heparin solution. A piece of split skin measuring 15 x 7 cm is easily removed from the right thigh using the dermatome. Due to the size of the defect, after demonstrating the findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>, another piece of skin is removed, measuring 8 x 8 cm from the thigh ............laterally. This is done without any problems. Dressing with starch powder and Mepilex. Suture the flap into the defect. The flap is successively sutured into the defect, sometimes with sutures. This is achieved without tension. Prior to this, infrahyoid muscles were pedicled at the left superior thyroid artery and lifted and mobilized as a Remmert flap while preserving the innervation as far as possible. After soft tissue preparation, the pedicle is pulled through under the mobilized Remmert flap and inserted into the right side of the neck. Here, the artery and three veins of the flap are conditioned first, a confluent vein and the two cephalic veins. The superior thyroid artery is then conditioned. This is incised slightly so that the lumen fits better with the lumen of the radial artery. Suturing using 8.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, very good arterial flow and good venous return. Conditioning of the veins. The thyroid vein is removed with two ends. The proximal ends are clipped. The two ends are each anastomosed with the confluent vein or one end of the cephalic veins with a 2.5 mm coupler after appropriate conditioning. After opening the clamps, good venous flow, positive smear phenomenon. The facial vein is then prepared. A small outlet is selected for the anastomosis with the second cephalic vein. This is also done using a 2.0 coupler. Here too, after opening the clamps, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The proximal end of the facial artery is first clipped and then ligated. Careful irrigation of the entire wound area and hemostasis are now performed. The Remmert flap is now inserted into the former tongue base area on the pedicle to create volume augmentation and fixed in place using several 3.0 Vicryl single button sutures. Subsequent irrigation and hemostasis. Inspection of the flap enorally, it is vital and well supplied with blood. The wound is now closed in layers, with insertion of a Redon drain on the left and two flaps on the right and epithelialization of the already created tracheostoma. For this purpose, the laryngectomy tube is removed and the size 8 tracheostomy tube is inserted and then fixed in place using sutures. A suture is placed on the right above the vascular pedicle at skin level to facilitate blood flow by means of Doppler monitoring. Inspection of the flap again. This is vital. The procedure is then completed without complications. The patient is ventilated and transferred to the intensive care unit. Please continue the intraoperative antibiotic treatment with Unacid for one week. Flap control according to the scheme for 5 days, clinically and by means of Doppler control every 2 hours. Nutrition via PEG tube for at least 10 days. Then X-ray pre-swallow and, if necessary, diet build-up. Overall cT3-4 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left with cN2c status. Awaiting final histology and then presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference. Prolonged disturbance of swallowing function is to be expected. In this case, even after an unremarkable swallow, presentation to the voice and speech department or swallowing training on the ward.

This spreads relatively far into the parapharyngeal soft tissues. The above plan is therefore adopted.","<CLINICIAN_NAME>: Before intubation, perform another tracheobronchoscopy: insertion of the 0° optics. Unobtrusive conditions in the area of the trachea and bifurcation as well as the visible main bronchi. Intubation by the surgeon and finally performance of an esophagoscopy with gastroscopy and insertion of a PEG using the thread pull-through method in the usual manner. This was successful without any problems. Good diaphanoscopy. Subsequent endoscopy of the hypopharynx and larynx. Inconspicuous conditions here. The previously described tonsil tumor is seen on the left. First of all, detailed consultation with the anesthesiologist regarding the further procedure. Then sterile wound covering. Carry out the neck dissection on the left: Skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Very pronounced metastases in this area. Dissection of the external jugular vein, which remains intact. Then dissection in depth. A metastasis is found directly there. The metastasis is cut around with part of the muscle. Dissection of the internal jugular vein in depth, which is later removed and ligated as part of the radical operation. Now the vagus nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, the external and internal carotid arteries are dissected in depth. Dissection of the posterior digastric venter muscle and very careful clearing of the accessorius triangle after exposing the nerve. Dissection caudally and anteriorly. Complete the neck dissection. Removal of the capsule of the submandibular gland. Now counter-resection from the transoral side. To do this, cut around the tumor in the area of the tonsil, passing over to the base of the tongue. Deposition of the tumor clinically in healthy tissue. Removal of the tumor specimen and removal of circular marginal samples. The marginal specimen is found to be still tumor-infested in depth and laterally in the frozen section. Due to this extension, a counter-resection must be performed from the cervical side. Now further dissection in depth. Protection of the carotid artery. Resection of the pharyngeal musculature extending to the base of the tongue and removal of the entire tonsil bed. Clinical incision far into the healthy tissue. Smaller branches of the external carotid artery are also cut and severed and the lingual nerve, which also runs deep through the area still affected by the tumor, is severed. Again, marginal samples are taken, which are now found to be tumor-free. The defect is now larger and can only be covered with a radial flap. Now first perform the neck dissection on the right side: To do this, make a skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Expose the muscle. Dissection in depth. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, facial vein, vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. Dissection of the external and internal carotid artery. Dissection of the posterior digastric venter muscle. Dissection of the accessorius triangle from caudal to supraclavicular. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle and removal of the lymph nodes from the anterior neck preparation and the venous angle while sparing the entire structures. Removal of the capsule of the submandibular gland. Extensive hemostasis with H2O2 swabs and bipolar coagulation. No more bleeding. Insertion of a Redon drainage. Subcutaneous suture, skin suture and wound dressing. Finally, perform a tracheotomy: make a longitudinal and star-shaped incision over the jugulum. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Formation of a Björk flap and creation of an epithelialized tracheostoma. After tumor resection, a radial flap is now inserted. See the surgical report <CLINICIAN_NAME>. <CLINICIAN_NAME>: After creation of the R0 resection using combined transoral enoral resection, defect coverage using a microvascularly pedicled radial flap from the left side: First removal of the forearm flap: Defect was previously measured, flap dimension with three-dimensional, multi-lobed dimensions 10 x 8 cm with regard to size expansion. Flap is recorded on the forearm. Subsequent application of a tourniquet. The flap is then trimmed and the skin incision made in the direction of the elbow bend. Lift the flap subfascially from the ulna to the radial side. Radial inclusion of the superficial venous system. This is integrated into the pedicle with subcutaneous tissue up to the crook of the elbow. Forearm mucosa nevertheless remains supplied with subcutaneous tissue. The radial artery and accompanying veins are removed, clamped and supplied distally and proximally using 4.0 Prolene puncture ligatures. The flap was then lifted off basally and successively towards the antecubital fossa, with smaller, outgoing vessels being treated using clips. Changed anatomical situation in the antecubital region. There is a very small radial artery as well as another artery further distally, which also enters the pedicle. The interosseous artery, brachial artery and ulnar artery were previously identified. The venous vascular system does not show a brachiocephalic vein, but a relatively large accompanying vein that opens into the brachial vein and a smaller vein above it belonging to the surface vascular system. This accompanying vein and 2 arteries are conditioned. The tourniquet is then opened. Good flow into the flap. Flap is placed on the 4 vascular structures. Treatment here using ligatures or 4.0 Prolene puncture ligatures in the area of the arteries or double treatment using clips. Flap is flushed with heparin. Flap arteries less than 1 mm or between 1 and 1.5 mm. In the area of the forearm, hemostasis and layered wound closure are performed. A full-thickness skin is typically removed from the groin area. After thinning, this is sutured into the forearm defect without tension. A Vacuseal dressing is then applied in the typical manner. Suction 75 mmHg. The forearm is immobilized in a splint using an elastic bandage. Defect covered with a radial flap: Radialis flap is inserted into the defect and successively sutured into place using 3.0 Vicryl single button sutures in the area of the pharyngeal side wall, base of the tongue and floor of the mouth. Tension-free suturing. Both sides of the neck are revised again after neck dissection with regard to the connecting vessels. The left side is selected as the connection. The radial artery and smaller accompanying artery are anastomosed with the terminal branch of the superior thyroid artery and a branch branch branching off from it using 9.0 or 10.0 ethilon sutures. Good venous return after opening the clamps. Subsequent exposure of the external jugular vein to the cranial side, where it divides. It is placed here and supplied proximally using clips. Venous outlets are conditioned, also venous outlets from the flap pedicle. Anastomosis is performed with 2.0 or 2.5 couplers. After opening the clips, venous return is also good here. Positive smear phenomenon. Flap pedicle is fixed with several sutures to prevent kinking of the vascular anastomoses. Subsequent irrigation of the wound area with Ringer's solution and careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers on both sides of the neck with insertion of a Redon drain. The site of the Doppler check is marked. Repeated enoral check shows a vital and well-vascularized flap. Final consultation with the anesthetist. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue the antibiotic treatment with Unacid started intraoperatively for 1 week. Please continue therapy with heparin perfusor 500 units per hour, also started intraoperatively, for 5 days. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube for 10 days, then if necessary build up the diet. Please monitor Doppler for 5 days according to the schedule.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Flap coverage (Radial), Tracheotomy, PEG placement

For this, skin incision below the cricoid cartilage, then dissection up to the musculature, splitting of the musculature at the linea alba. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, separation of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea and creation of a visor tracheotomy between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis and reintubation. Then insertion of the mouth blocker and adjustment of the tumor. Before this, the tumor was inspected again with the Kleinsasser B-tube. The tumor is located in the vallecula with transition to the lingual surface of the epiglottis and the base of the tongue on the left side. The oral retractor is then inserted and tumor resection begins. For this, 1/3 of the epiglottis must also be removed and dissection up to the base of the tongue. Hemostasis using monopolar coagulation. The preparation is thread-marked and sent to the frozen section. A resection is taken before the frozen section, as it can be seen that the median margins are barely resected. This resection is also sent to the frozen section. In the frozen section itself, all margins are tumor-free and also free of carcinoma in situ. No tumor tissue in the frozen section. Then repositioning for neck dissection on the left side. For this, skin incision in the usual manner. Exposure of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Level IIa and b show a large metastasis. Then exposure of the internal jugular vein, the cervical vascular sheath and dissection of the metastasis from the internal jugular vein, including resection of the facial vein, as this infiltrates the tumor. The superior thyroid artery is also resected as the tumor infiltrates it. The accessory nerve, hypoglossus and vagus remain intact. A small medial part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle must also be removed. Then remove the remaining neck level and turn to the opposite side. Similar picture here. Skin incision in the usual manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland, digastric muscle and cervical vascular sheath. Here, too, a large metastasis is seen in level II, which is carefully dissected from the internal jugular vein. Here too, the facial vein cannot be retained, but all other structures can be retained. Clearing of the remaining neck levels and insertion of Redon drains on each side and two-layer wound closure. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring while awake. Before the tumor resection, a PEG was inserted using the thread pull-through method. This is successful with good diaphanoscopy. Please feed via PEG for 3 days, then build up diet and TE diet.

Here, the trachea is clear, with a whitish mucosal overlay on the right side of the glottis in the area of the anterior commissure. Otherwise unremarkable conditions. Intubation transnasally without any problems. Flexible esophagogastroscopy was then performed first. The gastroscope was inserted and the laryngoscope was checked and there were no problems with the esophagoscopy up to the stomach. Inconspicuous conditions here. Puncture of the stomach with excellent diaphanoscopy and insertion of the PEG using the usual thread pull-through method. Inspection of the esophagus on retraction, inconspicuous findings here. Now entering with the Kleinsasser tube. An exophytic tumor of the left oropharynx is seen on the left side, passing over to the soft palate to the left parauvular region. Significant lateral growth towards the mandibular branch and towards the soft tissues of the neck, the glossotonsillar groove and a circumscribed part of the base of the tongue are also affected. An extension towards the posterior pharyngeal wall and hypopharynx. Otherwise, apart from the lesion in the area of the right vocal fold described above, the findings were unremarkable. A sample is now taken from the anterior right vocal fold, which shows a polypoid mucosa in the frozen section without dysplasia or evidence of malignancy. Therefore, no further measures are taken here. Now start with the enoral resection of the tumor. For this purpose, resection of the tumor including about 2/3 of the soft palate, resection with posterior palatal arch, resection border reaching anteriorly to buccally. A clear growth towards the alveolar ridge and the soft tissues of the neck can be seen in the deep area. The tumor is now detached in the direction of the alveolar ridge. The alveolar ridge itself is not infiltrated. Push off the tumor here, laterally dissect the tumor, taking the masticatory muscles with it down to the pterygoid process. Further dissection with careful palpation of the cervical vascular sheath, removal of the tumor is very difficult with limited mouth opening in the area of the glossotonsillar junction and the base of the tongue. In this case, about 1/3 of the base of the tongue is removed. Further resection is carried out transcervically. Mucosal samples are taken covering the soft palate, buccal alveolar ridge, tongue and posterior pharyngeal wall, all of which are diagnosed as tumor-free in the frozen section. In the area of the pterygoid muscles and the lateral wall, multiple biopsies are taken in the area of the wound bed for screening purposes. All of these were later also assessed as tumor-free. Finally, the exposed alveolar ridge is ground with the diamond bur. This is followed by repositioning. First start with the neck dissection on the left side. Skin incision. Exposure of the platysma, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the digastric and omohyoid muscles. Exposure of the submandibular gland, exposure and preservation of the facial vein, successive evacuation of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, exposure of the internal jugular vein. Resection of level V with careful protection of the plexus branches. A thoracic duct cannot be visualized. No evidence of lymph flow. Evacuation of level Va and the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerves. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and the common carotid artery with its division. Exposure of the vagus nerve. Now extirpation of the submandibular gland after removal of the digastric muscle and clearing of level Ib. Now continue to expose the hypoglossal nerve as well as the internal and external jugular. After further exposure, perform the pharyngotomy. After snaring the external and internal carotid arteries and securing the hypoglossal nerve, further resection of the tumor in the area of the lateral wall of the oropharynx and base of the tongue. The lingual nerve must be removed if there is tumor infiltration. Removal of the tumor in toto. This is sent for definitive histology. The edge samples are now taken again in the caudal region, all of which are also classified as tumor-free. Finally, sufficiently wide pharyngotomy. Now ab............. and measure the required graft. At the same time, a radialis graft elevation of approx. 13 x 6 cm and neck dissection on the right, initially for radialis graft elevation. Creation of a tourniquet. After marking the graft, excision of the graft using a skin monitor. Exposure of the superficial ramus, radial nerve, a true cephalic vein is not found. Strictly subfacial preparation. Exposure of the distal lobe pedicle. Deposition after puncture and ligation and ligation with very strict subperiosteal elevation of the graft with clipping of outgoing vessels. Two strong veins develop in the antecubital region, but they do not show any confluence and have no obvious direct connection. The double-barreled venous system is left in place and the radial artery is removed. After opening the tourniquet, vital graft and good conditions, later removal of the graft after ligation and puncture. Meticulous hemostasis and careful two-layer wound closure with full-thickness skin graft from the right groin. A 13 x 6 cm full-thickness skin graft is lifted from the groin for this purpose. Strictly cutaneous preparation. Careful mobilization and undermining of the surrounding tissue. There is a discrete protrusion in the area of the outer inguinal ring, questionable inguinal hernia, but no openings. Multi-layered subcutaneous suturing and skin suturing after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. In the area of the forearm, final application of a vacuum supply and application of a cramp splint. Now to the neck dissection on the right side. Skin incision for this. Exposure of the platysma, cutting of the platysma, placement of a platysma flap. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A true external jugular vein is not found. Exposure of the auricularis magnus nerve. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle as well as the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. Evacuation of the anterior neck level while sparing the superior thyroid artery, the facial vein and the cervical sinus as well as the hypoglossal nerve. Evacuation of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and evacuation of level V with careful protection of the plexus branches. In the area of the veno-jugulofacial angle, a 3 cm large lymph node was found, which was macroscopically suspicious, otherwise there were no macroscopically suspicious masses in the area of the neck dissection. After extensive hemostasis with dry wound conditions, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Now perform the tracheotomy. To do this, make a horizontal skin incision and cut through the skin layers. Identification of the linea alba and the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, transection of the isthmus. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea and insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring and performance of the mucocutaneous anastomosis, which is successful and stable. Problem-free reintubation to an 8 mm tube. At the end of the operation, reintubation onto an 8-gauge cannula with a core, which is sutured in place. The graft is now removed. Sewing in the transplant. This is extremely difficult if the mouth opening is restricted. Successive transcervical and transoral placement and final suturing of the graft combined transorally and transcervically, which is relatively difficult with a narrow mouth opening, but is successful in the end. Good fit on all sides and reconstruction of the defect, which subtotally affects the soft palate, extends anteriorly to the buccal, dorsally exceeds the middle of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Reconstruction of the glossotonsillar groove and about 1/3 of the base of the tongue and the lateral wall of the oropharynx. Now vascularization. Expose the superior thyroid artery. After positioning the stalk, perform the arterial anastomosis after cleaning the vessels with 8.0 Ethilon. This is somewhat more difficult due to the vascular relationship, but is successful. Problem-free, good flap perfusion. After opening the vascular clamps, immediately very pronounced venous return with good flap perfusion. Both venous stumps now show high reflux with no clear differences. The decision is now made to anastomose the vein preferred by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. To do this, first remove the facial vein. There is complete thrombosis of the vein. Despite thrombectomy, shortening and heparin irrigation, recanalization is not successful. Another facial branch also tends to be thrombosed. Flow can only be generated if the branch is shortened back directly to the internal jugular vein, but there is no possibility of coupler anastomosis in the immediate vicinity, therefore ligation with primary in.................. Vessel diameter for the primary suture. Now also laborious vein search. Exposure of a superior thyroid vein. Here the anastomosis is successful with the size 2.5 coupler. Extremely difficult preparation conditions overall during vein preparation due to extremely thin vein walls and high vulnerability. Sufficient venous anastomosis with arterial flow, but pronounced reverse flow with multi-............. increased effect on the remaining vein. Therefore, no possibility of ligating this vein is seen here. Further laborious dissection and identification of another thyroid vein superior laborious dissection conditions. Finally, another Coupler anastomosis of size 2.5. After opening the arterial blood supply, sufficient venous anastomosis with excellent flap perfusion and vitality. Pedicle positioning and, in relatively dry wound conditions, insertion of a flap and very careful two-layer wound closure after monitor placement. Excellent flap aspects can also be seen here with enoral control. Termination of the procedure at this point. The patient received intraoperative antibiotics with Unacid, which should be continued postoperatively with Unacid 1.5 g for at least 3 days. Penetrating and hourly flap vitality check, for this purpose the superficial flap pedicle was marked with a thread, if the graft could not be completely overlooked due to the mouth opening. Please make sure to check the X-ray paps on the 9th to 10th postoperative day. Decannulation should be attempted in the medium term depending on the postoperative swallowing function. Due to the interoperative extension, certainly cT3 tumor, at least local adjuvant therapy is certainly indicated here.","Tumor resection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Modified radical neck dissection on the right, Panendoscopy, PEG placement

To do this, enter with 0° optics under laryngoscopic control. The subglottic region and the trachea are revealed. Subsequently intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Subsequent entry with the small bore tube under dental protection after inspection of the inconspicuous oral vestibule. First inspection of the oropharynx. This is symmetrical and clear. The base of the tongue itself is clear on both sides, as are the lateral walls of the pharynx and the vallecula. Inspection of the hypopharynx, which is clear up to the tips of the piriform sinus and the entrance to the esophagus, and the endolarynx is also inconspicuous. Then perform the flexible esophagogastroscopy. To do this, enter with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy to see through to the stomach. This is inconspicuous and clear. The oesophagus is also inconspicuous on reflection. Subsequent exploration of the oral cavity. There is an exophytic, exulcerated mass on the right edge of the tongue, extending from the anterior third to the posterior third. The exulcerated part measures approx. 2 x 1 cm, but with extensive submucosal growth. In this case, the total extension is at least 4 cm in length and at least 1.5 cm deep infiltration. The tumor is cut around with an electric knife with a safety margin of 2 cm. An extensive soft tissue mantle is also left on all sides of the tumor in the area of the musculature. Ligation of stronger vessels from the lingual artery and stronger veins, otherwise hemostasis by coagulation and removal of the tumor macroscopically clearly in sano. The specimen is completely suture-marked for urgent definitive histology. Wound irrigation and, with absolutely dry wound conditions, completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperatively, macroscopically extensively resected, submucosally very aggressively growing tongue margin carcinoma. A neck dissection on both sides with defect reconstruction, most likely using an anterolateral thigh graft, should be planned as soon as possible.

In our disciplinary tumor conference, the indication for primary surgical treatment was made.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesiology colleagues and anesthesiological preparation, the primary tumor area was inspected again. This revealed an extensive mass in the area of the soft palate with a completely tumor-infiltrated uvula, extensive infiltration of the soft palate with significant submucosal infiltration. The tumor reaches the upper tonsillar lobe on the right side, also just on the left side. Overall transverse diameter of the tumor over 4 cm, therefore T3 extension. No tumor growth beyond the tonsillar lobe to the caudal side. PEG tube inserted first. Here, insertion with the gastroscope, under laryngoscopic control, easy advancement into the stomach. If diaphanoscopy is good, the stomach is punctured without any problems and the PEG tube is inserted using the usual suture pull-through method. Subsequent repositioning of the patient with preparation for microvascular defect reconstruction. First turn to tumor resection. For this purpose, the tumor is resected with a safety margin of a good 1 cm with consecutive subtotal soft palate resection. Tonsillectomy is performed if the tumor has spread to the upper pole of the tonsil on both sides. For a better overview, the anterior palatal arch is removed on both sides. The tonsil capsules on both sides are regular, on the left side circumscribed transition to the posterior palatal arch. Generous resection here too. The back of the soft palate can now be explored. Tumor growth towards the submucosa, but no mucosal infiltration. Successive development of the tumor and resection of the tumor macroscopically in toto. Removal of the soft palate and both tonsil lobes. In the submucosal preparation, a slightly narrower approach to the tumor capsule is seen in the area of the soft palate on the right side, which is why a complete definitive resection is performed here. All margins are then covered with margin samples, all of which are assessed as tumor-free. An R0 resection can therefore be assumed here. The tumor and the resected margin are sent for definitive histology. The graft required to cover both tonsil boxes and to restore the soft palate is now measured. The graft measures a total of 13 x 6.5 cm. The neck dissection and radialis graft removal are now performed in parallel to the neck dissection. Start with the right side. Make a curved skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose and cut through the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland, exposure of the digastric muscle. Removal of the neck preparation with careful protection of the facial vein, the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Overall, due to the patient's anatomy and the somewhat varied course of the vessels, the preparation conditions were considerably more difficult. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, dissection of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and dissection of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Level Ib is then evacuated with extirpation of the submandibular gland. This is followed by resection of the digastric muscle and a pharyngotomy measuring approx. 2 ˝ QF to position the pedicle. Overall, several nodules in the neck area, conspicuous in size and number, without infiltration of neighboring structures. In principle, the same procedure was used on the left side. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Ligation of very strong superficial veins with drainage into the anterior jugular vein and external jugular vein. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with preservation of a deep facial vein branch, a superficial facial branch is removed. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery and hypoglossal nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Numerous lymph nodes can be seen in the area of the very deep vein angle. Macroscopically highly visible nodus measuring approx. 3.5 cm. Careful dissection of the accessorius nerve, but this can be preserved. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful preservation of the nerve and clearing of level V with careful preservation of the cervical plexus branches. Subsequently skeletonize the submandibular gland and evacuate level Ib while carefully protecting the oral branch. Careful wound inspection and palpation, followed by wound irrigation with H202 and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. At the same time, the radialis graft was harvested from the left forearm. After marking the graft, the tourniquet was applied. Cutting around the graft. Radial exploration of the cephalic vein. Perform the Haydn maneuver to identify the superficial ramus, radial nerve. Locate the distal vascular pedicle. Dissection after ligation. Ulnar dissection with exposure and visualization of the flexo carpi ulnaris. Complete detachment of the graft by strict subfascial dissection, proximal dissection of the pedicle including the drainage area of the cephalic vein. Careful clipping of outgoing veins in the antecubital fossa. Exposure of the extremely strong bridge of the radial veins into the cubital veins, including the cephalic vein. Positioning of the venous system to the side and exposure of the radial artery with securing of the outlet of the ulnar artery, reopening of the tourniquet. Careful, meticulous hemostasis with a regular graft. After removal of the graft, the wound is carefully closed in two layers in the forearm area and the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the groin is inserted. The vacuum sealing pump is then applied and the Cramer splint is placed in the functional position. For full-thickness skin harvesting from the right groin, incision of a full-thickness skin graft measuring approx. 14 x 6 cm, strictly cutaneous elevation. Subcutaneous mobilization, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain after careful wound inspection and hemostasis. Subsequent strong two-layer wound closure. The radialis graft is now inserted. Successive insertion with significantly more difficult insertion conditions due to the swelling that has now occurred and the rather strong radialis graft, successive insertion. Finally, good reconstruction of the soft palate with the graft still in place. Careful cervical stem displacement. Cervical preparation of the right side of the facial vein and the superior thyroid artery. The facial artery is also prepared. This is followed by anastomosis with the superior thyroid artery due to a jump in the caliber of the suture. After initially regular flow, there is now a lack of venous flow. Cessation of pedicle pulsation, therefore reopening of the artery in case of occlusion. Due to the rather unfavorable caliber conditions, preparation of the facial artery and renewed arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. This now works well. Immediate regular venous return and excellent graft perfusion so that venous anastomosis with the coupler system is performed after preparation of the flap vein and the facial vein. After measuring a size 3.5 coupler, anastomosis is performed without any problems. Subsequent regular graft perfusion. Careful cervical wound inspection, wound irrigation and subsequent insertion of a guided 10 Redon drainage and careful two-layer wound closure. Due to the significant swelling that has now set in, a plastic tracheostomy is then performed. A horizontal incision is made at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Ligation of superficially pronounced veins. Dissection of the infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the very deep trachea. Exposure and transection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. This shows a clear ........ or ossification of the trachea. Entry between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Somewhat laborious creation of a broad-based Björk flap with clear ossifications in the area of the tracheal clasps. Subsequent insertion of the tracheostoma with generally difficult insertion conditions due to the cartilage conditions. Subsequently, problem-free reintubation to a size 9 low cuff cannula and, after final enoral inspection with a vital graft, termination of the procedure at this point. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT3 cN2c soft palate carcinoma. Reconstruction using a radialis graft. Due to the initial graft swelling and the more difficult adaptation conditions, the patient should not be given food until the 10th postoperative day. With proper graft healing and swallowing function, timely closure of the tracheostoma should be possible.","Pharyngectomy, Neck dissection, Defect reconstruction, Free flap (Radial)

During a panendoscopy with emergency tracheotomy, a glottic laryngeal carcinoma of at least cT3 was histologically confirmed. Our interdisciplinary tumor conference decided on primary surgical treatment. Secondary findings revealed an open tuberculosis, which was primarily treated with medication. The patient now presented after completion of TB treatment with clear tumor growth per continuitatem through the existing tracheostoma. Immediately preoperatively, an exophytic tumor measuring approx. 5 x 6 cm was found around the tracheostoma with satellite-like tumor foci DD skin metastases. CT confirmed the extension with glottic carcinoma with complete consumption of the larynx and breakthrough through the tracheostoma to cutaneous and infiltration of the trachea with a new paratracheal mass on the left.","First of all, external inspection of the previously described, exulcerated tumor. Entry with the small bore tube under dental protection. Inconspicuous oral cavity and oropharynx. The base of the tongue and vallecula are also clear, as is the epiglottis. An exophytic, endolaryngeal tumor growth with complete displacement of the glottis or glottic entrance is now visible. However, the tumor does not exceed the aryepiglottic folds on both sides or the arytenoid region. Completely free hypopharynx, which can be visualized as far as the piriform sinus tips and the esophageal entrance. Insertion of a nasogastric feeding tube under visualization. The patient is then positioned and xylocaine with adrenaline is injected. The exophytic tumor growth is completely incised with a safety margin. Widening of the skin incision to lift an apron flap. Subplatysmal flap elevation is then performed first. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. All structures not infiltrated. Exposure of both sides of the internal jugular vein and facial vein. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery on both sides and the thyroid gland. Caudal visualization of the trachea. This is free of tumors caudally. If the tumor is externally on the right side, it can now be seen in depth on the left side. Paratracheal thyroid infiltration on the left. Paratracheal therefore subtotal thyroid resection, the vagus nerve is caudally caked into the conglomerate and is resected caudally. Right-sided circumscribed partial thyroidectomy, here with preservation of the superior thyroid artery on the left side. Ligation of the artery. Several lymph nodes conspicuous in number and size on both sides, but without definite malignancy criteria or perinodal growth. Clearing of level II to IV on both sides. Now visualization of the hyoid. Skeletonization of the larynx. Complete caudal exposure of the trachea. Entry into the trachea with resection of 2 tracheal clips, here macroscopically tumor-free externally. Complete mobilization of the larynx and the caudal tumour conglomerate. Entry pharyngeally at the level of the vallecula. Mucosa-sparing release of the epiglottis. Resection along the aryepiglottic fold with a safety margin of approx. 1.5 cm, also in the postcricoid region. Release the laryngeal skeleton while carefully protecting the esophagus. Performing the myotomy in the area of the upper esophageal sphincter and caudally in the area of the trachea to remove the larynx and the tumor in toto. On the left paratracheal side, there was a suspicious mass in the form of a lividly discolored, suspicious lymph node, corresponding to the CT diagnosis. Inspection of the specimen showed both the laryngeal tumor portion and the subglottic portion resected in sano on all sides with a safety margin of a good 1 cm. Somewhat unclear tissue changes or conspicuous changes in the caudal musculature. For this reason, a complete soft tissue margin sample was taken here, as well as imaging with margin samples of the entire tumor in the area of the mucosa and in the area of the tracheal abscess margin. Complete imaging of the skin resectate beforehand. All samples are diagnosed as completely tumor-free, meaning that an R0 resection has been achieved. The size of the defect is now measured, a skin defect measuring 11 x 7 cm in total. An anterolateral thigh graft is then harvested from the right. After marking the landmarks and doppler sonographic identification of the skin perforator and a strong secondary perforator, mark a spindle-shaped graft measuring approx. 12.5 x 7.5 cm. Medial incision. Exposure and securing of the rectus femoris muscle. Strictly subfascial preparation. Exposure of the perforators and the vascular pedicle. Performing the extension incision. Dissection of the vascular pedicle and release in the area of the intermedius muscle. A superficial musculocutaneous perforator course can be seen. Caudal removal of the vascular pedicle and elevation of the graft, taking the fascia lata with it. Inclusion of a narrow muscle cuff in the area of the perforators. Conditioning of the vessels and, if the graft is vital, removal of the graft. Careful wound inspection and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. The graft is now inserted, initially tracheally. If the trachea is clearly set off caudally, there will be slightly increased tension even after mobilization, especially in the pectoral skin area. Here, mobilization of the skin as far as possible and insertion of the trachea anteriorly as described above under increased tension conditions. Later, successive insertion of the tracheostoma primarily through the graft. Microvascular anastomosis is then performed on the right side. Conditioning of the lingual artery. Perform the arterial anastomosis with 8-0 Ethilon; this is successful and sufficient. Immediate regular venous return via primarily one flap vein, therefore occlusion of the 2nd vein. Conditioning of the facial vein. Perform the venous anastomosis with the coupler system size 3.0, followed by regular pedicle perfusion, positive smear test and regular flap perfusion. Then complete incorporation of the graft after checking all wound regions. In the case of dry wound conditions, insertion of a 10 Redon drain here. Subsequently, careful, two-layer wound closure with fitting of the graft. Finally, with a vital graft and fully incorporated tracheostoma, reintubation to a size 10 low cuff cannula and completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected, extensive cT4a cN+ laryngeal carcinoma with extensive peristomal spread. Postoperatively, please continue the intraoperatively started intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g for 24 hours. If the wound is healing properly, perform an X-ray gruel on the 10th postoperative day. Special wound observation in the area of the tracheostoma in case of difficult tissue conditions. If the wound is healing properly, rapid administration of the urgently required adjuvant therapy.

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was indicated. Sonographically, there is a largely constant cN2b neck status on the right.","Initial inspection of the primary tumor region. There is an exulcerated mass on the right edge of the tongue, only the tip of the tongue is left out. Extensive submucosal growth. The tumor clearly reaches the midline approximately in the area of the middle of the tongue and also crosses it submucosally; tumor growth decreases again towards the base of the tongue. The basal base of the tongue towards the vallecula is tumor-free again. In addition, exophytic tumor growth over the glossotonsillar groove and circumscribing the posterior floor of the mouth onto the anterior palatal arch. In the anterior palatal arch, tumor cones at the mucosal level up to above the uvula cavity. The tumor can be palpated and moved in a cervical direction, therefore a primarily transoral approach was initially performed. Cut around the tumor and dissect using the electric needle and dissection technique, maintaining a safety distance of at least 1-1.5 cm. The lingual nerve can be kept straight, the lingual artery is ligated and removed. Macroscopic clear in sano removal with a clearly tumor-free covering soft tissue mantle on all sides, especially submucosally. This is followed by the removal of completely covering marginal samples at the mucosal level and the removal of largely covering marginal samples in the area of the tongue body. An in sano resection for the invasive carcinoma can be seen on all sides. In the frozen section diagnosis, only in the area of the glosstonsillar furrow, where the distance is actually macroscopically wide, is there still a circumscribed Cis. For this reason, a resection was performed and a new covering margin sample was taken, which again showed no tumor or dysplasia, so that a clear R0 situation can be assumed. Overall, this results in an extensive defect of the tongue with approx. 2/3 resection, especially in the area of the middle of the tongue body. The soft palate portion was resected basally together with a tonsillectomy. As a result, the tonsil lobe and the posterior floor of the mouth were circumscribed. Measurement of the defect for later defect reconstruction, in the meantime bilateral tracheotomy is performed. Start with the right side. Submandibular skin incision, cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue, cutting through the platysma, exposing the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposing the omohyoid muscle, exposing the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation and preservation of the superior thyroid artery of the hypoglossal nerve of the cervical anus. A narrow facial vein branch must be removed later during tunnel creation. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein, overall in level II and III some nodules of conspicuous size and configuration, but without surrounding infiltration. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level Va with careful protection of the accessorius nerve and the cervical plexus branches. Finally, if the wound is dry, turn to the opposite side. Exactly the same procedure here, no macroscopically conspicuous nodes. The facial vein is preserved here, as is the external jugular vein on both sides. On the left side after evacuation of level IIa to Va. Wound irrigation with H202 and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Submandibulectomy is then performed on the right side and the tunnel is passed enorally. Widening of the tunnel, resection of the digastric muscle. Evacuation of level Ib with removal of further, macroscopically non-suspicious nodes. Ligation of the facial artery and after creation of a sufficient tunnel, later passage of the lifted graft to lift the antero-lateral thigh graft from the right. After marking the landmarks and doppler sonographic identification of the main perforator and two secondary perforators, the graft specially configured for the tongue edge/bottom of the mouth and tonsil region is marked. The graft measures a total of 16 x 7 cm. Medial incision due to the reconstruction of the entire length of the tongue up to almost the tip of the tongue. Identification of the rectus femoris muscle strictly subfacially. Dissection, identification of the vascular pedicle. Making the auxiliary incision. The supply of the graft through the ramus descendens is shown with a clearly visible fasciocutaneous course of the main perforator. Subfacial release. Incision of the graft involving the fascia lata. A narrow muscle cuff is left in the area of the outgoing main perforator. Isolation on the vascular pedicle. A strong accompanying vein with an additional narrower accompanying vein can be elevated so that the graft can then be placed under vital conditions. Careful wound inspection and hemostasis in the lifting area. Subsequent insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful multi-layer wound closure. The graft is then inserted under moderate tension. Due to the size of the defect and the graft, the conditions for insertion were considerably more difficult. Under laborious conditions, incorporation of the graft with an overall very good fit and complete coverage of the defect. After combined transoral and transcervical insertion, intact conditions on all sides. Pedicle positioning and conditioning of the pedicle vessels as well as the superior thyroid artery and the middle thyroid vein. Performing the arterial anastomoses with 8-0 Ethilon, revealing clearly vulnerable vessel walls with a large amount of vascular plaque, particularly in the area of the graft vessels. Clearly difficult adaptation conditions here. After initial anastomosis, there is no regular circulation. After opening the artery, ............... resection is seen. Careful excision of the anastomosis and repeat procedure. This is now sufficient and regular. Immediate regular venous return. Conditioning of the stronger flap vein and closure of the smaller one with sufficient venous outflow. Conditioning of the V. thyroidea media and insertion of the venous anastomoses with the coupler system using a size 3.0 coupler. Subsequently, with a positive smear phenomenon, regular pedicle position and regular flap vitality. Wound irrigation. Insertion of a size 10 Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Finally, a plastic tracheotomy is performed. This involves a horizontal skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea, transection of the slender thyroid isthmus. Due to the height of the larynx, insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring. Creation of a visor tracheotomy and insertion of the tracheostoma. Subsequent reintubation without difficulty to a size 8 low cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. The procedure was then completed with a vital graft and no indication of complications. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid, which should be continued for 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected extensive cT3 cN2b tongue margin carcinoma on the right with extensive ALT reconstruction. Please abstain from food for at least 7 days, then the first swallowing diagnosis can be started if the flap is viable. Overall, a prolonged recovery of swallowing function can be expected due to the extensive defect. Presentation in our interdisciplinary tumor conference to determine the adjuvant therapy that is certainly indicated.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Tracheostomy

The PET-CT shows a flat asymmetry of the enhancement in the area of the tonsil on the left more than on the right. In the ENT mirror findings, the left tonsil can be palpated discretely harder than the right, otherwise no suspicious mass. Based on the medical history and clinical findings, indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","First, transfer the patient to the operating theater. Then active patient identification and team time out. Consultation with the anesthesia department. Then induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Then head positioning by the surgeon and insertion of the Mc Ivor mouth spatula, taking into account the teeth, lips and tongue. Repeated inspection and palpation of the base of the tongue and tonsils. Only the left tonsil is found to be discreetly hardened, otherwise there is no suspicious mass, either by inspection or palpation. Tonsillectomy on the right side first. To do this, grasp the upper pole of the tonsil and dislodge it. Then make a parauvular mucosal incision and extend it caudally. Successive dissection along the tonsil capsule from the upper pole to the lower pole using raspa and scissors. Occasional bipolar coagulation. Separation of the tonsil at the lower pole after extensive bipolar coagulation. Inspection of the wound bed using an angled mirror. Isolated bipolar coagulation at the lower tonsil pole, then no further bleeding here. Isolated bleeding at the upper tonsil pole, also here biopolar coagulation, then no further bleeding. Insertion of hydrogen swabs on the right side and turning to the left side. Here too, grasp the tonsil at the upper pole and dislodge it. This is somewhat more difficult than on the opposite side. Parauvular mucosal incision and extension of the same with an approx. 0.5 cm wide margin. Now dissect the upper pole of the tonsil capsule. After a short time, it becomes apparent that this is more difficult and the upper tonsil pole appears to be cemented to the base. Demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Further tonsillectomy on the left using scissors and raspa. In the lower third, the preparation is much more successful, in the upper third an attempt was made to resect the adhesions and hardening completely in toto. The tonsil is easily removed at the lower pole after extensive bipolar coagulation. Then hemostasis at the lower tonsil pole. Only occasional focal hemostasis at the upper tonsil pole. The tonsil is suture-marked for frozen section. Long long upper cranial tonsillar pole, short long lateral tonsillar margin and short short dorsal cranial tonsillar pole. The right tonsil also goes to the frozen section. The right tonsil is free of carcinoma. On the left tonsil, there is basaloid squamous cell carcinoma at the cranial tonsillar pole up to the medial margin, matching the lymph node metastasis. The lateral tonsil margin and the dorsal cranial tonsil pole were free. Subsequent demonstration of findings at <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequent resection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First, a posterior resection is performed on the posterior palatal arch medially and a posterior resection on the anterior palatal arch laterally and at the base of the wound caudally. These resections are sent for final histology. Subsequently, marginal samples are taken and sent for frozen section, namely the medial posterior palatal arch, lateral anterior palatal arch and cranial anterior palatal arch. In addition, the cranial wound bed and caudal wound bed as well as the caudal margin. The frozen section also shows squamous cell carcinoma on the posterior palatal arch medially and, according to the pathologist, a carcinoma in situ in the cranial wound bed and non-assessable tissue in the caudal wound bed. For this reason, <CLINICIAN_NAME> subsequently performs another extensive resection in all areas of the previous margin samples. A final marginal sample is therefore taken from the caudal wound bed, a second resection is performed in the cranial wound bed, a final marginal sample is taken from the cranial wound bed, a second resection is performed on the medial posterior palatal arch and, last but not least, a final marginal sample is taken from the medial posterior palate. The areas of the previously described R1 resection are thus covered and a macroscopic R0 situation is present, resulting in the prolapse of fatty tissue at the lateral tonsillar margin, which is coagulated. However, there is no fistula in the direction of the neck. The posterior palatal arch is ultimately only marginally protruding. An adapting suture is placed in the area of the soft palate. The samples are now sent for final histology. Hemostasis is performed. No further signs of bleeding here. Unblocking after sufficient waiting time. Repeated inspection. No further bleeding here. A nasogastric tube is inserted and its position checked. Air can be auscultated in the stomach and gastric juice aspirated. Now turn to neck dissection on the left: The surgeon first positions the head. Then infiltration anesthesia with 6 ml Ultracaine 2% in the area of the planned incision. Then skin disinfection and sterile draping of the surgical area. Now mark the skin incision, which curves along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid, and mark landmarks on the mastoid, mandible and jugulum. Now cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Then cut and expose the platysma. The external jugular vein is cut in the process. Then expose the sternocleidomastoid, the omohyoid, the submandibular gland and the anterior and posterior digaster venter. Subsequently, clearing of the anterior medial neck dissection specimen while sparing the facial vein, the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve, the internal jugular vein and the cervical vein. Subsequent visualization of the accessorius nerve. Larger veins are ligated individually. Subsequent clearing of the accessory triangle. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and exposure of the external and internal carotid arteries and exposure of the vagus. Now clearing of the lateral neck triangle from level IV to level II with transition to level Va. Careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Subsequent wound irrigation with Ringer and wound inspection. Isolated bleeding here. These are stopped using bipolar coagulation. Now no further bleeding. Wound irrigation again. Now dry wound conditions. Subsequent insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Head repositioning by the surgeon and completion of the procedure without complications. Conclusion: suspected cT1 cN2b tonsillar carcinoma on the left. Neck dissection from level II to level Va and tumor tonsillectomy on the left. The first resection revealed focal squamous cell carcinoma on the posterior medial palatal arch as well as CIS in the cranial wound bed and non-assessable conditions in the caudal wound bed. For this reason, a second resection was performed with final margin samples, which were sent for final histology. In R0, the swallowing function should be awaited; if this does not appear sufficient, flap coverage is possible before adjuvant therapy. In the R1 situation, presentation at the tumor conference and planning of a subsequent resection with flap coverage and discussion of a contralateral neck dissection.

As this needs to be confirmed again, a test biopsy with a frozen section is performed on the ward before the start of surgery. <CLINICIAN_NAME> decides on squamous cell carcinoma.","Intraoperatively, before intubation, positioning of the laryngeal entrance with the laryngoscope. Entering with the 0 degree optics and endoscopy of the larynx and trachea. This is inconspicuous. The visible main bronchi are clear. After intubation, perform a microlaryngoscopy: adjust the small bore tube. Vocal folds, anterior/posterior commissure, supraglottic region inconspicuous. Pharyngoscopy: piriform sinus on both sides, postcricoid region, posterior pharyngeal wall, lateral pharyngeal walls and esophageal entrance clear. Finally, a flexible esophagoscopy was performed: the esophagoscope was easily advanced into the stomach. Inconspicuous conditions there. No evidence of a second tumor on retraction. Now adjusting the tonsil barring device. An exophytically growing tumor can be seen in the area of the right tonsil, which also extends anteriorly towards the base and edge of the tongue. Grasp the right tonsil with the grasping forceps and begin dissection at the cranial margin with scissors and monopolar coagulation. Dissection in the healthy tissue behind the tonsil. The posterior palatal arch is preserved. Further preparation towards the alveolar ridge and anteriorly towards the tongue. Part of the base of the tongue and the tongue are included. Sharp dissection here with monopolar coagulation. Finally, the tumor with the tonsil and parts of the tongue and the base of the tongue are completely incised and extirpated in toto. Circular margin samples are taken and sent for frozen section. These are found to be tumor-free. Overall, an R0 situation can be assumed for a cT2 tonsil/oropharyngeal carcinoma. After resection of the tumor, it can be seen that large parts of the submandibular gland are exposed. Individual injecting vessels were previously bipolarly coagulated and are now clipped again. Application of TachoSil. Consultation of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. It is decided not to perform a neck dissection at this time. This must be performed in 14 days after the wound has started to heal. The submandibular gland must be preserved for coverage. In addition, individual vascular stumps are treated with clips. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring and should remain there over the weekend. In the event of post-operative bleeding, tamponade directly in the tonsil lumen. This should be clinically feasible.","Tonsillectomy

Overall, the mass was partly necrotic and appeared liquid, measuring over 10 cm in total. The Kleinsasser tube was inserted under dental protection and the inconspicuous oral cavity and oropharynx were inspected. An uneven mucosa can now be seen at the entrance to the left piriform sinus, which merges into an ulcerated tumor in the area of the left piriform sinus. The uneven and partly slightly elevated mucosa moves to the posterior wall of the hypopharynx, just not reaching the midline and caudally free esophageal entrance. The tumor infiltrates the hemilarynx via the medial piriform sinus wall and breaks through it here and appears submucosally in the area of the pocket fold. The glottic plane itself and the subglottic region are exposed. The patient is now repositioned and prepared. Incision of the monstrous mass on the left cervical side with sufficient safety distance, completion of the incision to the right in the sense of an apron flap. Dissection of the healthy skin in the form of an apron flap. Detachment of the mass which broadly infiltrates and destroys the sternocleidomastoid muscle, also resection in case of infiltration of the omohyoid muscle. Caudal visualization of the cervical vascular sheath. The internal jugular vein can already be seen here with significantly reduced flow, with clear infiltration cranially. This is therefore removed. Exposure and preservation of the common carotid artery and vagus nerve. Cranially, the mass also infiltrates the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Sectional exposure of the ramus marginalis mandibulae. Removal of several small nodular lymph nodes. Extirpation of the gland with protection and exposure of the lingual nerve and ligation of the excretory duct. Complete resection of the cervical plexus branches, the accessorius nerve is also infiltrated. Separation of the internal jugular vein and the cranial sternocleidomastoid muscle. Now dissection of the carotid artery walled around the MCC at a good 180°. Further dissection reveals a clear infiltration of the vagus nerve. This is therefore resected. The hypoglossal nerve can be separated from the mass, here no infiltration. There is now an infiltration of the external carotid artery up to just before the bulb. The internal carotid artery is free. Separation of the external carotid artery close to the bulb and removal of a marginal sample. This is shown to be tumor-free in the frozen section diagnosis. Therefore, in sano resection of the carotid artery with an overall extensive surrounding wall and removal of the mass in toto which, however, is clearly inflammatory. Intraoperative drainage of serous fluid in the sense of extensive necrosis, overall vulnerable conditions. Subsequent right-sided release of the hemilarynx. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage....... Release of the right-sided piriform sinus. The left-sided resection of the hyoid was already performed during the metastasis resection. Now removal of the residual hyoid. Entering enorally at the level of the vallecula. Successive widening of the pharyngotomy sparingly along the right aryepiglottic fold. Now a good overview of the tumor. Incision of the tumor, which has clearly quieter mucosal extensions in the periphery with a safety margin of approx. 1.5 cm. Resection to just before the middle of the posterior hypopharyngeal wall. Deposition at the esophageal entrance. No more suspicious conditions here. The tumor is now completely covered with marginal samples in the mucosal area, the entire base is radically removed in the course of the neck dissection. The frozen section diagnosis now shows the invasive carcinoma R0 resected, circumscribed Cis in the area of the posterior hypopharyngeal wall. A resection is therefore performed here and a final marginal specimen removed, so that the overall situation is R0. Now to the harvesting of the antero-lateral thigh graft. After identification of the landmarks, doppler sonographic identification of the main perforator and 2 secondary perforators. Configuration of the graft to cover the pharyngeal defect due to the extensive hypopharyngeal resection in this case, as well as a skin defect measuring approx. 13 x 7 cm. A graft measuring a total of 27 x 8 cm was removed as a two-incision flap. Medial incision, separation of the extensive fat layer. Identification of the rectus femoris muscle. Subfascial release and exposure of the regularly configured pedicle vessel. Widening of the incision. Identification of the main perforator and two secondary perforators. Dissection of the perforators with circumscribed musculocutaneous course. Isolation on the perforators. Removal of the fascia lata to protect the perforators, otherwise it is left in place. Complete cutting of the graft. Isolation on the vascular pedicle and placement of the excellent vital graft after thinning out the lateral ends, paying careful attention to the vascular fat layer. Finally, vital graft and placement of the pedicle vessel. Subsequent insertion of 10 redon drains and careful multi-layer strong wound closure. <CLINICIAN_NAME> Neck dissection on the right: visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Then release of the neck preparation IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches; the internal jugular vein and the cervical vascular sheath were previously exposed. The superior thyroid, facial and lingual arteries were preserved, as was the facial vein. Insertion of the transplant. First, the graft is sutured into the hypopharynx with the smaller skin island. To do this, start at the base of the tongue and successively suture in the entire graft portion intended for the pharynx. This is successful without any problems. Then reposition and advance the microscope and dissect the arterial vessels using <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The connective tissue is removed from the superior thyroid artery and the facial artery. Ultimately, there is very good flow in the superior thyroid artery. This is flushed with xylocaine by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and temporarily clamped. The vascular anastomosis is then performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First suture the artery, this is successful without any problems. Dissection of the veins, the graft veins are extremely small and have many valves. It is therefore difficult to perform the venous anastomosis using a coupler. Finally, it is successful and the graft shows very good perfusion and also very good reperfusion. Then insertion of a Redon drain on the right side and a flap on the left side and fitting the second skin island of the graft first into the tracheostoma, then into the large skin defect on the neck.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement, Defect coverage, Free flap (ALT)

The panendoscopy performed <2013> revealed a cT1b glottic laryngeal carcinoma on the right side. Decision to take the above measures.,"First, after induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues, a rigid tracheoscopy is performed using O° optics in the area of the trachea up to the carina. Subsequent problem-free endotracheal transoral intubation with a laser tube and positioning of the patient by the surgeon. Entry into the endolarynx with the Kleinsasser B-tube. An exophytic mass was found starting at the transition from the posterior to the middle third of the right vocal fold, affecting the entire vocal fold, reaching the anterior commissure and infiltrating the most anterior part of the left vocal fold via the midline. The supraglottis and subglottis were unremarkable. Thus, cT1b glottic laryngeal carcinoma on the right was emphasized. The remaining left vocal fold was unremarkable. With very good adjustability, decision to perform transoral microscopically controlled laser resection. Demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Setting the CO2 laser to continuous mode with a power of 6 watts. Focusing the laser beam and moving around the pre-existing mass from the posterior starting point under microscopic control of the safety distance. A circumscribed exposure of the thyroid cartilage occurs in the area of the anterior commissure. Circumventing the mass in the anterior third of the left vocal fold and depositing the tumor specimen which is sent in for final histology (short short posterior, short long superior towards the pocket fold, long long anterior towards the anterior commissure). Five marginal samples were then taken, posterior, superior towards the pocket fold, inferior towards the subglottic, anterior commissure, anterior left vocal fold. All marginal samples were sent for frozen section examination. According to the pathologists, all marginal samples were found to be tumor-free. Only in the inferior border sample in the subglottic direction and on the left vocal fold could no statement be made in the frozen section regarding the detection of dysplasia. In order to keep the glottic defect as small as possible and in view of the microscopically unremarkable subglottic region and left vocal fold anteriorly, post-resection was not performed and the final histology should be awaited. Hemostasis with a swab soaked in Otriven. Repeated inspection and, if there was little bleeding, completion of the procedure without complications.","Endoscopic laser resection

Then marking and setting of the apron flap, whereby the tracheostoma is included in the apron flap. Dissection of the apron flap cranially to beyond the hyoid bone. Now start with the neck dissection on the right side. Here, regions II to V are removed while sparing all non-lymphatic structures. However, a lymph node metastasis can be seen around the internal jugular vein, which can just be dissected away from the vessel in a healthy layer macroscopically. Identification and dissection of the superior thyroid artery, which must be removed at the upper thyroid pole. Then dissection of the carotid artery, which is dissected laterally from the laryngeal skeleton. Then incision of the constrictor pharyngis muscle at the lateral edge of the thyroid cartilage and release of the piriform sinus on the right side as far as possible. On palpation, the tumor also appears to have partially grown into this area. Release of the lateral horn of the hyoid bone and separation of the suprahyoid muscles up to the middle. Then cut the straight muscles of the neck, pass under the thyroid isthmus and expose the anterior wall of the trachea up to the already existing tracheostoma. Then transition to the opposite side. Similar conditions here in principle. However, it can be seen that the left neck is in principle a single large metastasis extending from region IIa to region V. This is also macroscopically dissected in a healthy layer of the internal jugular vein, which lies medial and ventral to the metastasis. Resection of the metastasis en bloc reveals the brachial plexus. In addition, the phrenic nerve can now be seen to pass through the middle of the caudal metastasis, so that it must be removed. The metastasis is then developed retroclavicularly from the caudal side. This exposes the thoracic duct, which is also opened. It is then grasped and ligated. Finally, the metastasis can be completely removed from the caudal side. The site of the thoracic duct is also ligated so that no further lymphatic leakage can be seen clinically. Then dissection of the superior thyroid artery, which is extremely small in caliber. Therefore, dissection of the external carotid artery cranially and identification and dissection of the facial artery, which is deposited on the mandible and beaten caudally and later used for anastomosis. The suprahyoid muscles are now also removed here. The large tumor is palpable in the area of the lateral hyoid horn and the piriform sinus, so that no further manipulations are performed here. Now dissect the lingual side of the epiglottis up to its upper edge. Cut the pharyngeal mucosa at the upper edge of the epiglottis and enter the pharynx, initially to the right along the upper edge of the glottis. This reveals the tumor on the left. This occupies the entire left pharyngeal wall, spreads to the larynx, spreads endolaryngeally and has already infiltrated the right arytenoid. The tumor is then successively removed on both sides under visual control with an appropriate safety margin. The entire left pharyngeal wall is resected. The resection continues caudally into the esophageal orifice before it can be carried out on the opposite side so that the larynx can then be removed ventrally at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage. Circumferential mucosal margin sections are then taken from the remaining pharynx, all of which prove to be tumor-free. The small amount of muscle still present in the posterior pharyngeal wall on the left side is also biopsied in the form of marginal incisions, which also prove to be tumor-free. This leaves only a strip of mucosa approx. 2 1/2 to 3 cm wide on the posterior pharyngeal wall. A radial lobe graft was then removed from the left forearm, each 7 cm wide and 10 cm long. After placement of the radial lobe graft, it is sutured into the defect, with the stalk being diverted caudally. The radial artery is then anastomosed to the facial artery. Venous drainage takes place through 2 veins in the end-to-side internal mandibular artery. In the meantime, a 6 x 10 cm split-thickness skin graft is harvested from the right thigh and used to cover the left forearm. Finally, freshening of the tracheostoma by resection of the granulating altered skin. Folding back the apron flap and two-layer wound closure in the usual manner after applying Redon drains on both sides and a flap on the left in the area of the anastomosis. Re-intubation of the patient. Repeated check of the flap, which can be easily seen with a laryngoscope. End of the operation, transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Laryngo-pharyngectomy for large hypopharyngeal laryngeal carcinoma. Cervical metastasis on both sides and mainly on the left. Therefore resection of the phrenic nerve on the left as part of the metastasectomy. Very close relationship of the metastases to the internal jugular vein on both sides. Covering of the defect on the left forearm with split skin from the right thigh. Due to the caudal extension of the resection to the esophageal entrance, the insertion of a provox prosthesis was initially dispensed with, whereby the myotomy was already performed intraoperatively for a possible later secondary Blom-Singer puncture.","Laryngo-/Pharyngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection I-IV, Free flap (Radial)

Adjuvant therapy was not carried out at the time. Now externally confirmed second carcinoma on the palatal arch, therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","Induction of anesthesia and intubation transnasally by the anesthesia colleagues. Then sterile washing and draping. Then inspection of the oral cavity and oropharynx. There is an exophytic mass in the area of the soft palate, starting on the left side, which extends over the entire soft palate on the left and 2/3 of the soft palate on the right, including the uvula. The carcinoma spreads to the alveolar ridge and moves towards the glossotonsillar groove and infiltrates a small part of the base of the tongue. Now start with the tumor inspection: First use the monopolar needle to cut around the carcinoma in the soft palate area at a distance of 1-1.5 cm. Careful dissection with removal of the entire soft palate on the left side and 2/3 of the soft palate on the right side. Then resection of the gum from the alveolar ridge of the lower jaw on the left. Here the mass can be easily pushed away from the bone and removal of the posterior palatal arch, mostly on the left side. Removal of the glossotonsillar groove and part of the base of the tongue. Then send the entire preparation for frozen section. In the area of the base of the uvula to the border of the soft palate on the right and in the wound bed in the area of the pterygoid process and in the area of the glossotonsillar groove, carcinoma in situ can still be detected in the frozen section. These areas are resected everywhere and another frozen section is made. Then finally R0. A frozen section can no longer be obtained in the area of the pterygoid process, as this has been resected down to the bone. The pterygoid process is then chiseled off in this area and sent as a marginal sample for final histology. Now measure the defect. The defect is 14 cm from cranial to caudal, including the width of the soft palate. Now transition to neck dissection on the left side. Here, skin incision 2 ˝ QF below the mandible and exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland, the cervical vascular sheath, the vagus nerve and the accessory nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. After previous neck dissection there is hardly any fatty tissue and no visible lymph nodes. Sonography revealed conspicuous lymph nodes in level Ib. The submandibular gland is removed here. The digastric muscle is severed. This automatically leads to the oral cavity area. Clearing of level Ia and b and here several enlarged and also suspicious appearing lymph nodes are found, all of which are also removed. Then neck dissection of the right side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The skin of the neck is massively scarred due to previous surgery. Horizontally curved skin incision in a skin fold along the former scar. Dissection of the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Exposure of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid. Difficult preparation conditions with scarred conditions in the case of previous surgery. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland, the accessorius nerve and the cervical vascular sheath. Here too, difficult preparation conditions in the case of previous surgery and scarred, caked conditions. The jugular vein and vagus nerve are scarred with the sternocleidomastoid, but can be detached and spared. The carotid artery can be visualized in depth. In the area of the jugular vein, there is an injury to the same. This is grasped with the Satinsky clamp and sutured over with Vascufil. No further bleeding here. If there is a history of neck dissection on this side, no actual neck preparation can be developed here as no lymphatic tissue can be visualized. Demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Some tissue is removed from the caudal part above the omohyoid muscle and sent for histology. Punctual hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Irrigation of the wound with hydrogen and Ringer's and, if the blood is dry, insertion of a Redon drainage and two-layer wound closure. The radial artery graft is lifted at the same time. Palpation of the radial and ulnar arteries. Marking of the defect, taking into account the duplication on the soft palate. Applying the tourniquets and cutting around the graft. Visualization of the cephalic and basilic veins and the venous star in the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle, the nerve and the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Unfortunately, one branch cannot be spared as it lies too far below the graft and the size of the graft is so large that the nerve branch cannot be dissected out. This branch must therefore also be removed. Exposure of the radial artery with the accompanying vessels and ligation and transection of these. Lift the graft from the tendon bed and dissect the pedicle up to the crook of the elbow. Lifting the venous confluence and one superficial and one deep vein. Then suture the arm in the usual way. Lifting of split skin from the right thigh to cover the defect on the left forearm and application of a pressure bandage with sewn-on swabs and application of a dorsal forearm splint. In the meantime, the graft is sutured into place. This is very difficult as the mouth opening is severely restricted and can only be opened slightly even under maximum relaxation. The graft is first fixed in the area of the nasopharynx, then folded and sutured in the area of the soft palate. Then further down to the oropharynx area. This is very difficult and has to be done partly transcervically due to the small mouth opening. The graft is finally sutured in completely. Then turn to the vessels of the neck. This is where the superior thyroid artery is located, which is conditioned as a connecting vessel. Only the facial vein is still present as a venous connection vessel. A branch located higher up can no longer be used because the caliber is too small, so the arterial anastomosis is performed as usual and only the facial vein is used as the venous anastomosis without connecting a second accompanying vein. Ultimately, good pedicle pulsation and no venous congestion in the graft. Insertion of a flap and two-layer wound closure. Before insertion of the flap, the tracheotomy is performed in the usual manner and inserted between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. A visor tracheotomy and a mucocutaneous anastomosis are performed and at the end of the operation the patient is intubated with a 9-gauge tracheostomy tube. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. He should continue to receive antibiotics for 24 hours. On the 10th day, please perform an X-ray emesis and build up a diet. Presentation of the patient in the tumor conference after receipt of the histology.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

A very superficially growing, slightly exophytic tumor with an uneven mucosal surface was found in the area of the vallecula. The tumor occupies the entire vallecula, passes centrally to the base of the tongue and extends over almost the entire surface of the lingual epiglottis as well as over the right edge of the epiglottis. Now first perform the PEG insertion. To do this, enter with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Pre-insufflation into the stomach without any problems under constant air insufflation. If conditions are normal and diaphanoscopy is good, puncture the stomach and insert the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method without any problems. No abnormalities in the area of the esophagus on reflection. Now enter with the Steiner tube and visualize the findings. Successive removal of the very superficially grown tumor with constant correction of the spreading tube. Under the microscope, it can be seen that a tumor cone is also moving across the aryepiglottic fold towards the anterior piriform sinus wall. The superficial tumor is removed in the area of the epiglottis with the mucosa on the cartilage. The free right epiglottis margin and parts of the aryepiglottic fold are removed. This results in a complete resection of the vallecula with partial resection of the base of the tongue and partial resection of the epiglottis. This is followed by a post-resection, which corresponds to the tumor cones in the direction of the piriform sinus anterior wall. Marginal samples are taken in the area of the left vallecula and the base of the tongue. Due to the extensive tumor growth and the sometimes clearly dysplastic mucosal conditions at the tumor extensions, no further marginal samples are taken. Finally, when the wound is dry, the tracheotomy is performed due to the large area of the wound. A T-shaped incision is made below the cricoid. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Expose the cricoid cartilage and carefully detach the thyroid isthmus, which is very thin here. Pronounced bipolar coagulation and separation of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior tracheal wall and insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Now first perform the neck dissection on the left side. To do this, make a skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Creation of a platysmal flap. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Exposure of the muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Numerous lymph nodes in the area of the venous angle and the accessorius triangle are already visible in the preliminary preparation. Now expose the omohyoid muscle. Trace the muscle and expose up to the hyoid. Expose the submandibular gland, taking the caudal gland capsule with it. Release in the direction of the hyoid. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the facial vein. Now expose the cervical vein and in this layer release the anterior neck preparation while carefully preserving and exposing the superior thyroid artery as well as the vein and the hypoglossal nerve. Now free preparation of the vein while carefully protecting the lymph nodes lying on it. Cranial dissection up to the digaster, carefully protecting the accessorius, which runs over the vein and on which numerous nodes lie. In some cases very laborious dissection here, but no macroscopic lymph nodes exceeding the capsule. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V coming via the cervical sinus while carefully protecting the plexus branches. If the wound is finally dry, wound irrigation and two-layer wound closure after insertion of a 10 Redon drain. At the same time, perform the neck dissection on the right side. Here too, skin incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Separation of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A large lymph node conglomerate lying on the internal jugular vein can already be seen here. First visualization of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric nerve. Now successive exposure of the lymph node conglomerate, which lies broadly against the facial vein and the internal jugular vein. Particularly difficult dissection here. The mass is directly adjacent to the vein and can only be separated from it in a final layer with great effort. Meticulous dissection is also required in the area of the nevus accessorius. Here, too, the mass is in direct contact with the vein. However, all the structures mentioned could be preserved. Separation of the mass. Then completion of the neck dissection. Successive clearing of level V with careful protection of the plexus branches. Similarly, complete anteriorly. Clearing out here, also protecting the hypoglossal nerve and the superior thyroid artery. If the wound is finally dry, final inspection and wound irrigation and, after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure, completion of the procedure after final reintubation on an 8-gauge low-cuff cannula without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Neck dissection performed on the right side at the same time. Here too, skin incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Separation of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A large lymph node conglomerate lying on the internal jugular vein can already be seen here. First visualization of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric nerve. Now successive exposure of the lymph node conglomerate, which lies broadly against the facial vein and the internal jugular vein. Particularly difficult dissection here. The mass is directly adjacent to the vein and can only be separated from it with great effort in a final layer meticulous Extensive vallecula carcinoma with cN2c neck status on the right side. Pronounced lymph node conglomerate in the area of the accessorius triangle and the venous angle, which was removed with considerable effort by a functional neck dissection. Due to the very superficial tumor growth and the broad extension as well as the expected further dysplastic mucosal conditions in the head and neck area and the adjuvant therapy that was certainly indicated, the tumor resection was performed without extensive covering of the marginal specimens. Treatment with tracheal cannula depending on postoperative swallowing function.  ","Laser resection of Vallecula cancer, Functional bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement

Incision of the process, which occupies the entire left vocal fold from the arytenoid cartilage to just before the anterior commissure. Resection safely in healthy tissue both in the area of the arytenoid cartilage tip and in the area of the anterior commissure as well as laterally, cranially and caudally. A partial chordectomy is performed. Removal of two marginal samples. Careful hemostasis. Dry conditions at the end of the operation. The tube was covered with a swab before resection.

With an initial suspected diagnosis of CUP syndrome, a cT1 hypopharyngeal carcinoma was histologically confirmed as the primary tumor during a panendoscopy. In addition to unclear esophageal changes, clarification by our colleagues in Medicine 1 revealed a CIS 24 cm from the tooth row with additional unclear lung findings. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, it was decided that the primary surgical treatment of the hypopharyngeal carcinoma would be re-evaluation and, if necessary, endoscopic resection of the esophageal findings and monitoring of the lung findings.","After induction and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, the patient is first positioned. Repeat pharyngo-/laryngoscopy: For this purpose, enter with the Kleinsasser tube under dental protection. With an unremarkable oral cavity and oropharynx as well as an unremarkable endolarynx, the exophytic tumor can be seen in the right-sided postcricoid region, as described above, measuring approx. 2 cm and still well mobile at the mucosal level without submucosal infiltration of the thyroid cartilage or the arytenoid joints. The rest of the hypopharynx is free up to the tips of the piriform sinus and the esophageal opening. The dental guard, the lip retractor and the FK blocker are now inserted. Difficult, but ultimately regular adjustability of the tumor with good exposure of the postcricoid region. Successive resection of the tumor with the monopolar. Resection while sparing the cartilaginous bony structure. The tumor is sent for definitive histology. Removal of representative marginal samples. These are shown to be completely tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Therefore, after careful wound inspection and hemostasis, a nasogastric feeding tube is initially inserted if the endolaryngeal conditions are narrow and a tracheotomy is not performed if the conditions are narrow. Rearrangement for neck dissection: palpation reveals a rough and barely displaceable paralaryngeal mass. Injection of xylocaine with adrenaline. Incision of the old scar. Cutting of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Subcutaneous extensive scarring. Cutting through the remains of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is broadly infiltrated from the underside, therefore first exposing the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle caudally. Separation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and preservation of the external jugular vein. The omohyoid muscle is also clearly infiltrated. The same applies to the parlaryngeal musculature. The cranial accessorius nerve can be preserved. Thorough exposure of the internal jugular vein. The facial vein is infiltrated, otherwise the internal jugular vein can be preserved. Careful dissection of the common carotid artery. The mass extends directly to the perivascular connective tissue, but is certainly not infiltrated. Dissection in case of infiltration of the superior thyroid artery. There is also clear infiltration of the hypoglossal nerve. This is also removed. Dissection of the cervical vascular sheath, which is normal except for the infiltration of the structures mentioned. Clearing of the accessorius triangle while preserving the nerve. Clearing of level V with careful preservation of the cervical plexus branches. Overall en bloc resection of the massively surrounding scarred and massively perinodally growing metastasis. Careful wound inspection. Wound irrigation. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Turning to the opposite side: skin incision also made on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the facial vein and the cervical vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and clearing of level V a with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Careful wound inspection and, if the wound is dry, wound irrigation, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Subsequent completion of the procedure with slim enoral conditions. The patient received intraoperative single-shot antibiotics with Unacid. Postoperative nutrition via the inserted nasogastric tube for 3 to 4 days, after which oral nutrition should be possible without any problems.

Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery was indicated.","First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The exophytic tumor is seen in the area of the lingual epiglottis, vallecula and base of the tongue, extending from the paramedian left to the right, with deep ulceration in the direction of the hyoid bone. There is also a second tumor in the area of the pharyngeal wall on the right at a distance of 1-2 cm. Aryepiglottic fold free on both sides. In the CT, the tumor extends to the hyoid bone. Therefore, laser resection does not make sense, so the primary indication is a transcervical procedure with flap coverage. This is followed by PEG placement: insertion of the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach. Once the diaphanoscopy has been performed, a 15 mm stomach wall tube is inserted without complications. This is also fixed to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Subsequent repositioning for tumor resection, neck dissection on both sides and flap coverage. Injection of a total of 15 ml Ultracaine with adrenaline into the sides of the neck for the planned apron incision. Sterile draping of all relevant surgical areas. First, creation of an apron incision and lifting of the skin in the sense of an apron flap subplatysmal in a typical manner up to the level above the hyoid bone and at the level of the submandibular gland on both sides. First neck dissection on the right: visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein and facial vein. Exposure of the external jugular vein. V. facialis is set off cranially at the gland. This is connected to the relatively narrow internal jugular vein by a dense venous plexus. Exposure of the vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. Subsequent evacuation of neck level II-V with visualization and preservation of the branches of the cervical plexus. Several enlarged and suspicious lymph nodes, particularly cranially. Subsequent neck dissection on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Drawing of the skin incision in the sense of an apron flap. Skin incision, transection of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Creation of a platysmal flap by subplatysmal dissection of the flap cranially. This is done until the submandibular glandulae are exposed. First turn to the left side. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissection along the muscle in depth until the branches of the cervical plexus are exposed. Identification of the omohyoid muscle and dissection on the muscle up to the hyoid bone. Identification of the submandibular gland and opening of the glandular capsule as well as release of the gland and dissection anteriorly up to the hyoid bone. Identification of the digasatric muscle. Identification of the N. accessorius and sparing of the free preparation of the nerve. Division of the neck dissection on the internal jugular vein with the blunt dissecting scissors. Now carefully detach the lateral neck preparation Level II, III and IV as well as V in one piece. This is carried out with constant bipolar coagulation of minor bleeding and protection of the surrounding nerve structures. Identification of the hypoglossal nerve and now also release of the medial part of levels II and III. Tracheostoma creation (dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME> is still missing) Then combined transoral, transcervical tumor resection: once again visualization and securing of the following structures with the vessel loop N. hypoglossus, A. carotis interna and externa and A. lingualis. Exposure and preservation of the superior laryngeal nerve. Exposure of the pharyngeal wall and separation of this from the area of the vascular sheath and the spinal column. The digastric and stylohyoid muscles are each cut for a better overview. The submandibular gland is removed. Exposure and preservation of the lingual nerve. The Mc Ivor blade is then inserted. The 2nd tumor is exposed transorally and the pharyngeal tube is opened above it under internal and external control. Successive development of the tumor. The entire hyoid bone with attached residual parts of the infrahyoid and suprahyoid musculature is removed. Removal of the supraglottic region including the epiglottis up to the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage with the uppermost parts of the aryepiglottic fold. The lower part of the base of the tongue is resected almost to the opposite side. The lingual nerve from the opposite side is not touched. Vallecula with attached pre-epiglottic fatty tissue and hyoid bone is completely resected. Resection extends cranially to the lower tonsil pole in the area of the pharyngeal wall on the right. Subsequent suture marking of the specimen. Removal of a marginal sample from the base of the tongue. Preparation as a whole in healthy tissue, including marginal sample from the base of the tongue. In the area of the pharyngeal wall in the area of the second tumor, there is still moderate dysplasia up to the edge. Mucosa is therefore removed again in the area mentioned in a width of approx. 5 mm. This is sent for final assessment. This is followed by careful hemostasis and irrigation. Lifting of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Marking of the graft to be lifted in the presence of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. S-shaped skin incision on the proximal forearm and visualization of the venous confluence in the crook of the elbow. A strongly developed cephalic vein can be seen which can be followed distally to the radial edge of the flap. Skin incision in the area of the radial edge of the flap and dissection down to the forearm fascia. This exposes the external ramus of the radial nerve, which can be safely spared. Now also ulnar skin incision and dissection down to the deep forearm fascia. Subfascial dissection, leaving the peritendineum intact and folding the flap over to the border of the extensor carpi radialis muscle. Identification of the flap pedicle and trial clamping using a vascular clamp for 5 minutes: during this time, a good perfusion signal should be measured pulsoxymetrically. Then clamp the distal radial artery with the accompanying veins and place two vascular ligatures using a prolene thread. Successive dissection of the flap pedicle from the depth with constant supply of the perforator vessels using a vessel clip and bipolar coagulation. Dissection of the flap pedicle up to the antecubital fossa, identification of the venous vessels and the outlet of the radial artery. Separation of the radial artery and placement of a vascular ligature. The veins are now also removed and the radial artery graft is lifted without complications. The wound is closed using split skin from the right thigh by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Then removal of split skin from the right thigh in a typical manner. Closure of the forearm wound and insertion of the split skin into the skin defect. Application of Mepilex dressing and swab dressing, which is molded with absorbent cotton. Arm is fixed in Cramer splint with elastic bandage in functional position. Attachment of the arm. Radialis flap, which was rinsed with heparin after removal, is now inserted into the defect. Successive suturing of the radialis flap into the defect. This is achieved completely tension-free with complete coverage of all relevant defect areas. Radialis is fixed anteriorly to the thyroid cartilage and cranially on the right to the lower tonsil pole. Due to the remaining lack of volume, a Remmert flap is lifted on both sides in the typical manner on the superior thyroid artery and supplied with the cervical artery. Mobilization is carried out to such an extent that the flap can be inserted as a volume substitute without any problems, onto the radial artery flap. Vascular anastomosis beforehand: conditioning of the right lingual artery and the radial artery. Suturing with 9-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. Subsequent conditioning of both cephalic veins and the confluent vein. The confluent vein is anastomosed with an outlet from the vascular network of the facial vein, which is connected to both the external and internal jugular vein, using a 2.5 mm coupler after appropriate vascular conditioning. Good venous return after opening the clamps. Positive smear phenomenon. One of the cephalic veins is anastomosed with another outlet from the facial vein using a 2.5 mm coupler. Here too, after opening the clamps, venous flow is good, smear phenomenon positive. All other outlets are clipped both in the area of the flap pedicle and in the area of the facial vein. Subsequent careful irrigation. Hemostasis. Now insertion of the Remmert flap pedicled on both sides into the volume defect.

Sterile draping. First creation of an apron flap in the typical manner. Then neck dissection on both sides. First on the left: Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, digastric muscle, omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, external jugular vein, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, superior thyroid artery. Exposure, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve, accessorius nerve and branches of the cervical plexus. This is followed by a level II-IV evacuation as well as level V a and parts of V b. Neck dissection on the right side: This is performed in the same way as on the left side, exposing and preserving the structures mentioned. Level II-V evacuation here too. Subsequent laryngectomy: visualization of the hyoid bone and removal of the hyoid bone with parts of the supragottic musculature due to the pre-epiglottic soft tissue infiltration underneath. The soft tissue can be removed up to the pharyngeal tube. No tumor infiltrates here. Then skeletonize the larynx, first on the left and then on the right. Expose the superior cornu in each case. Separate the infrahyoid muscles and strike them latero-caudally. Dissect the lobe of the thyroid gland and also strike it latero-caudally. Dissect the trachea. Then dissection of the pharyngeal tube and dissection of the piriform sinus on both sides. Then enter the larynx at the level of the epiglottis. Removal of the epiglottis. This is isolated along the mucosal border. The tumor is seen endolaryngeally in corresponding, almost complete filling of the endolaryngeal lumen. Dissection of the pharyngeal tube from the larynx in the postcricoid area. Successive caudal development of the larynx. Prior to this, the trachea was opened and the laryngectomy tube was replaced with a tracheotomy tube. The trachea was first fixed to the skin using two sutures. The larynx can then be removed after the connections to the pharyngeal tube or oesophagus have been completely loosened. Macroscopically far from healthy. The pre-epiglottic soft tissue infiltrations are also well covered with the resected suprahyoid muscle parts. The specimen is suture-marked in the area of the hyoid bone and the pre-epiglottic soft tissue insertion margin and is sent for final assessment. Myotomy is then performed. For this purpose, the left lateral constrictor pharyngis muscle or pars fundiformis is cut through to the mucosa over a length of approx. 3 cm. Provox insertion is then made. For this, a mid-dorsal puncture is made approx. 1 cm below the tracheal margin and a size 8 Provox prosthesis is inserted without complications. The previously removed tracheal tube is then reinserted. Successive pharyngeal suturing. First layer using inverting single-button sutures. Then second layer using inverting single-button sutures, also with Vicyl 3-0 single-button sutures. The third layer involves suturing the constrictor muscles. Subsequently, as after tumor removal, extensive irrigation of the surgical area with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers and insertion of a Redon drainage in both sides of the neck. The tracheostoma is epithelized in the typical manner. Final wrap dressing. Final discussion with the anesthetist. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please provide post-operative nutrition via the inserted gastric tube for seven to ten days, followed by gruel and, if necessary, a diet.

It can be seen that there is a narrow mucosal margin of about 2-3 mm between the lower pole of the right tonsil and the incipient exophytic mass. From there, the exophytic mass extends to the hypopharyngeal side wall with the extensions to the plica pharyngoepiglottica on the right side. The exophytic mass is only broadly attached to the posterior wall of the hypopharynx and has a relatively narrow base compared to the tumor volume. The mass is easily displaceable over the pharyngeal musculature. Then docking of the robot and insertion of the functional arms. With very good adjustability, the tumor can then be easily dissected from cranial to caudal using the Maryland grasping forceps and the monopolar spatula. Enter directly under the lower pole of the right tonsil. Then dissect laterally down to the pharyngeal muscles. Continue the incision along the pharyngeal muscles. Cut around the base of the tumor with a safety margin of about 3-5 mm. The dissection is then carried out successively further caudally with subtle hemostasis. Here the tumor is finally deposited at the pharyngoepiglottic plica. Now take representative margin samples from the anterior deposition area, the posterior deposition area, the deep deposition area at the wound bed and the caudal and cranial deposition margins. All margin samples are then sent for intraoperative frozen section diagnostics and are all found to be tumor-free. Subtle hemostasis is then performed. A vascular stump in the area of the hypopharyngeal side wall is dissected free and then carefully coagulated. Subsequently, the wound is dried even after the retractor has been relaxed. The creation of a tracheostoma is not necessary given the extent of the resection. The insertion of a nasogastric feeding tube is also not necessary. However, the patient should be given a diet with TE light food for the next few days. At the end of the procedure, another final consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. It was then agreed that the patient would be monitored postoperatively in the intensive care unit of the ENT clinic after the recovery phase.

It is noticed that there is a suspicious lesion on the posterior pharyngeal wall relatively far cranially in the oropharynx; this is biopsied and sent for a frozen section. This also shows squamous cell carcinoma, which was not previously described. This area is connected submucosally with 2 further suspicious areas that were previously described, 1x in the hypopharynx at the entrance to the piriform sinus and 1x at the transition between the oropharynx and hypopharynx. All these lesions are connected submucosally. Then sterile washing and draping and start with transoral tumor resection. Cut around the tumor with the monopolar needle.

Exposure of the left part of the hyoid bone and the superior laryngeal nerve. Expose the pharyngeal muscles and then enter with the small bore tube and determine the site where the pharyngotomy will be performed. It can be seen that the tumor is at the entrance to the piriform sinus and is therefore also partially under the thyroid cartilage. Exposure of the upper horn of the thyroid cartilage and detachment of the piriform sinus from the thyroid cartilage on this side. The upper horn of the thyroid cartilage and a small part of the thyroid cartilage must be resected in order to reach the tumor properly.

With persistent pain in this area and unremarkable panendoscopy <2014>, computed tomography showed a cM0 situation. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was recommended.","After enoral inspection and confirmation of the extent of the tumor, transoral resection is performed after exposure of the tumor as described above on the dorsal right edge of the tongue with transition and infiltration of the glossotonsillar groove. Cut around the tumor from a safety distance of 1.5 to 2 cm, especially in the area inside the tongue. Dorsal resection up to just below the midline, no deep or more extensive infiltration in the area of the base of the tongue. However, poor overview here. Partial resection of the posterior floor of the mouth. Exposure of the submandibular gland, but no infiltration here, but tumor cones behind the gland in depth. Therefore, after resection of the enoral part, including the right-sided tonsil and resection of the glossotonsillar groove, the decision was made to proceed transcervically. For this purpose, submandibular incision and cervical separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation and dissection of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and auricular nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and digastric muscle. First perform the neck dissection. Clear out the anterior neck preparation, carefully preserving the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery, the facial vein and the hypoglossal nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein, visualization of the accessorius nerve, clearing of the accessorius triangle and clearing of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Macroscopically, no suspicious nodules on the right cervical side. Now release the submandibular gland and complete level Ib. Enter via the posterior floor of the mouth enorally. Separation of the digastric muscle, widening of the access to the enoral side, step-by-step good overview of the tumor and taking along circumscribed muscles of the floor of the mouth as the tumor cone grows. Resection of the tumor transcervically in toto. The specimen shows a clear safety margin on all sides, especially in the area deep to the tongue. Only in the area of the glossotonsillar groove and the posterior floor of the mouth is there a safety margin of approx. 1 cm on the specimen, otherwise significantly more. It was therefore decided to take marginal samples in this area. Taking marginal samples from the preparation. In the frozen section diagnostics, these are free of dysplasia and tumor, so that a safe R0 resection can be assumed here. With a tumor measuring an average of 4 cm on the specimen, a cT2 extension is clinically just present. Measure the defect of the posterior floor of the mouth, the edge of the tongue, the base of the tongue and the tonsil lobe. Neck dissection of the left side is then performed first. Here also submandibular incision. Separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein, exposure of the limiting musculature. Clearing of levels II to IV with careful preservation of the superior thyroid artery, the facial vein, the cervical artery, the hypoglossal nerve, the accessory nerve and the internal jugular vein. No macroscopically conspicuous nodules here either. Inclusion of the caudal capsule of the submandibular gland. Finally, careful wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Perform a plastic tracheostomy. Horizontal incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea, insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a visor tracheotomy and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Subsequent problem-free transfer to a size 8 low cuff cannula which is suture-fixed. Now to cover the defect. Elevation of the ALT from the right, here after doppler sonographic identification of the main perforator and two secondary perforators. Marking of the graft measuring 11 x 6 cm in total. Medial incision. Cutting through the fascia lata. Reliable identification of the rectus femoris muscle. Subfascial release. Identification of the pedicle vessel. Subsequent identification of the main perforator. Successive free preparation of the main perforator in the sense of a perforator flap. Isolation to the strong pedicle vessel. The sonographically identified secondary perforators are branches of the main perforator. Therefore, take along the main perforator, take along parts of the fascia lata, otherwise cut around the graft. Isolation on perforator and pedicle vessel. Conditioning of the pedicle vessels, elevation of a strong accompanying vein as well as a narrower second vein, and placement of the properly vital graft after the supply and return vessels have been treated. Careful wound inspection and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Subsequent successive incorporation of the graft from the enoral and transcervical sides. This finally succeeds sufficiently with a good fit. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery. Performing the arterial anastomosis with 8-0 Ethilon, this is sufficient and successful. Immediate regular venous return via the main vein. No flow via the second vein. Therefore occlusion of the vein. Conditioning of the superior thyroid vein. Measuring a coupler size 3.0 and performing the anastomosis with the coupler system. Subsequently, regular graft perfusion, regular pedicle pulsation and positive spreading phenomenon. Subsequent careful wound inspection and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Positioning of the drain and careful two-layer wound closure and completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected at least cT2 cN0 tongue margin carcinoma on the right. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g, which should be continued for 24 hours postoperatively. If the enoral graft heals properly, attempt to swallow and gradually build up the diet from the 7th postoperative day.","Resection, Neck dissection, Microvascular transplant

Infiltration also towards the base of the tongue and here the midline is reached but not crossed. Overall indication for tumor resection, neck dissection and coverage with a radial flap. The apron flap is lifted first and a tracheostoma is created. Tracheotomy: Horizontal incision just below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Identification of the infralaryngeal musculature and division of the musculature in the midline. Push the musculature to the side and identify the cricoid cartilage. Sharp dissection of the cricoid cartilage and undermining of the thyroid isthmus. Bipolar coagulation of the thyroid isthmus and transection of the same. Identification of the anterior wall of the trachea. Careful removal of tissue from the anterior wall of the trachea. Tracheal incision in the 2nd to 3rd intratracheal ring space and creation of an epithelialized tracheostoma in the usual manner. Re-intubation with the 8-bore tracheostomy tube. PEG insertion: PEG insertion using the thread pull-through method. This is successful without any problems if the diaphanoscopy is positive. Tumor resection: First of all, cervical exposure of the cervical vessels as well as the hypoglossal nerve and vagus nerve. Snaring of these structures using Vessel-Loups. Vessels are dissected away from the soft tissue as far as the cranial side. The digastric muscle is severed and cut laterally and then resected at the lateral end. The mandible is exposed after pushing the soft tissues including the branch of the mouth cranially. The entire soft tissue is pushed away from the mandible with the periosteum from the angulus to the symphysis. Infrahyoid muscles are detached from the hyoid bone and dissected as a Remmert flap pedicled to the superior thyroid artery and the cervical artery and beaten downwards. The hyoid bone is then resected in the midline and included in the tumor resection together with all overlying soft tissue. The entire external musculature is resected in the midline. The entire dorsal body of the tongue, including the floor of the mouth and the largest parts of the sublingual gland, is resected transorally, except for the tip of the tongue. Resection also includes the areas of the tongue beyond the midline from the body of the tongue to the base of the tongue. The periosteum is also removed transorally from the lower jaw, the entire soft tissues and muscles of the floor of the mouth are also resected. The lingual nerve is also resected. In the further course of the operation, the hypoglossal nerve is also resected medial to the exit of the cervical nerve. The tumor is clearly resected macroscopically in healthy tissue and removed in toto. Multiple suture markings are made on the tumor, which is sent to the frozen section. Marginal samples of the mucosa are taken from the alveolar ridge to the floor of the mouth at the front, a further marginal sample of the mucosa from the middle of the tongue to the body with underlying soft tissue and soft tissue basally on the rest of the hyoid bone. All marginal samples and the marked tumor are sent for frozen section. Here, tumor in healthy tissue as well as marginal samples, thus R0 resection. Careful hemostasis and irrigation of the wound area and resection areas. The lingual artery and facial artery were already prepared as possible vascular anastomoses during the resection. The superior thyroid artery was included in the Remmert flap. Neck dissection on both sides by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Subplatysmal dissection of the apron flap. Beginning on the right side. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissection in depth. Finding the accessorius nerve and exposing it. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle and finding the submandibular gland. Elevation of the submandibular gland and protection of the marginal ramus. Exposure of the posterior venter of the digastric muscle up to region II b. Now expose and locate the accessorius nerve and protect it. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and its multiple outlets, including the facial vein. These are initially preserved, but then turned downwards to serve later as possible connecting vessels. Dissection of the jugulofacial angle and removal of multiple conspicuous lymph nodes. Protection of the hypoglossal nerve. Now dissection of the lateral neck preparation in regions II to V, sparing the vagus nerve and cervical plexus. The various branches of the external carotid artery are dissected in order to serve both as a Remmert flap and as connecting vessels. The lingual artery on the right side is removed. The cervical artery was also spared. On the left side, here too the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is exposed and the accessorius nerve is located, protected and preserved. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. Elevation of the gland, preserving the mandibular ramus and dissection on the digastric muscle posteriorly. Dissection along and on the internal jugular vein in a cranial direction. Here too, protect all outlets and the cervical vein. Follow the cervical vein to the hypoglossal muscle and preserve it. Now carefully dissect the lateral neck preparation and detach it while preserving the cervical plexus. It is cleared up to the omohyoid muscle, no chyle flow can be seen. There is also no increased bleeding. Now clear out the medial neck preparation, sparing all structures. The vagus nerve could also be visualized and preserved during the operation. The radial flap was then sutured into the defect. Successive suturing of the radial flap from the transcervical and transoral sides, partly after the sutures have been placed. The flap is successfully sutured in an anatomically three-dimensional manner so that both the lateral pharyngeal wall and floor of the mouth can be covered without tension, as well as the tongue and base of the tongue and the transition to the vallecula. The stalk is passed through the right side of the neck. Dissection of the facial vein, which has several outlets. Dissection of the facial artery. Anastomosis here, after conditioning the vessels with the radial artery. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. A branch of the facial vein is then anastomosed with the cephalic vein using a 3.5 mm coupler. The deep confluent vein is then anastomosed with another outlet from the facial vein using a 2.5 mm coupler. In each case, after opening the clamps, good venous flow and positive exclusion phenomenon. Overall, good blood flow after assessment of the flap. Extensive irrigation of the wound area. After further mobilization, the Remmert flap is sutured on the right side above the hyoid bone for volume augmentation. Subsequent careful hemostasis and irrigation of the wound area. Then wound closure in layers, with insertion of two flaps on the right and a Redon drain on the left and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. An 8 mm tracheostomy tube was then inserted and fixed in place. The defect on the forearm was primarily closed cranially and covered caudally with split skin, which was taken from the thigh on the right side. Defect augmentation using a Remmert flap from the right. Elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders 14 cm x 8 cm on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Covering of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Finally, attachment of the forearm. Good saturation and blood circulation of the left forearm at the end of the operation. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is ventilated and transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Please continue postoperative antibiotics with Unacid, as started intraoperatively, for one week. Nutrition via the inserted PEG tube for approx. 10 days, followed by an X-ray broth swallow and, if necessary, diet build-up. If necessary, initiate swallowing training in the voice and speech department. Control of the flap according to the scheme for 5 days by means of clinical checks and Doppler checks. Anastomosis area marked with right cervical suture. Awaiting the final histology. Then presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference to indicate radiochemotherapy if necessary.","Tumor resection, Neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy, Endoscopy

Secondary findings included mediastinal lymphoma with tracheal invasion. After healing of extensive peritonitis and prior treatment of the lymphoma, the patient now presented for definitive treatment. Due to the secondary diseases, our interdisciplinary tumor conference decided that surgery was the treatment of choice.","First of all, after intubation and preparation by the anesthesia colleagues, positioning of the patient. Inspection of the primary tumor region. An exophytic, exulcerated tumor is found in the area of the left edge of the tongue and the soft palate with involvement of the posterior floor of the mouth. Palpation reveals that the majority of the tumor is growing submucosally into the tongue. The tumor clearly extends beyond the midline in the area of the base of the tongue, but with sufficient residual distance to the opposite side. In addition, the tumor is clearly growing towards the floor of the mouth and cervically. Transoral tumor resection is therefore performed first. Removal of the soft palate section, taking the tonsil lobe with it, resection of the posterior floor of the mouth and resection of the exophytic tumor section up to the area of the edge of the tongue. This resection is completely covered with margin samples, which are diagnosed as tumor- and dysplasia-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Now continue the tumor resection from the transcervical side. Submandibular skin incision, separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue, dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the hardened submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. The tumor can be palpated under the submandibular gland with infiltration of the lateral floor of the mouth. Due to the depth, first expose the vessels. Evacuation of the anterior neck preparation with removal of the facial vein and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein of the vagus nerve in the area of the internal jugular vein Level II and III, several macroscopically clearly suspicious nodules can be seen, but these can be separated from the accessorius nerve. Removal of the metastases in toto. Cranial dissection, resection of the digastric muscle. Release of the submandibular gland while sparing the ramus marginalis mandibulae. Palpation shows the tumor infiltrating the floor of the mouth up to just before the hyoid, here moderately displaceable, therefore involving the left half of the hyoid. Cranial dissection along the carotid artery. Separation of the facial artery and lingual artery. The hypoglossal nerve also appears to be pulling into the tumor conglomerate and is removed. Now successive extension of the pharyngotomy over the tonsillar lobe and the lateral floor of the mouth, continuing over the pharyngeal side wall up to the level of the vallecula. Resection as described of the hyoid with attached external floor of mouth muscles. Resection of the tumor within the tongue, leaving a muscle cuff on the tumor so that the final tumor can be resected macroscopically in sano; only at one point was there a muscle tear above the tumor capsule during dissection, which is marked. An extensive resection is performed to cover this area. Covering of the tumor in the marginal area and in the previously described muscular part with marginal samples, these are also diagnosed as tumor-free and dysplasia-free, so that a R0 situation can finally be assumed. Measurement of the defect. At the same time, the right-sided neck dissection was performed and the antero-lateral thigh graft was lifted to perform the neck dissection. A submandibular skin incision is also made here. Cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the platysma. Dissection. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the hypoglossal nerve and the superior thyroid artery as well as the facial vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure and preservation of the accessory nerve, evacuation of the accessory triangle and level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Final wound inspection and wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. To elevate the antero-lateral thigh graft after doppler sonographic identification of a main perforator and three secondary perforators, the graft measuring a total of 15 x 10 cm with soft palate and tongue base configuration is indicated. Medial incision. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the rectus femoris muscle. Strictly subfascial dissection. Identification of the pedicle vessel, which runs relatively cranially. The ramus descendens is relatively weak. Identification of the fasciocutaneous perforator, the secondary perforators run intramuscularly, complete resection of the graft. Partial entrainment of the fascia lata. Inclusion of a sufficient muscle cuff. Isolation to the pedicle vessel. Isolation on the artery and vein and, if the blood supply to the graft is normal, removal of the graft. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure and adaptation of the skin edges. Subsequent successive insertion of the graft, primarily via the tanscervical area. Overall very good fit. Reconstruction of the entire tongue and reconstruction of the largely resected base of the tongue with good volume filling. Transoral completion in the area of the soft palate and floor of the mouth. Overall intact conditions on all sides. Cervical anastomosis conditions significantly more difficult due to the position of the anastomosis and the now somewhat obstructive muscle cuff. Conditioning of the detached lingual artery, arterial anastomosis performed with 8-0 Ethilon with good flow under markedly difficult suturing conditions with pronounced arteriosclerosis in the area of the graft vessel. Overall, however, intact anastomosis with immediate regular venous return. Conditioning of the facial vein in the stump area. Sizing of a coupler size 3.5 and insertion of the venous anastomosis without any problems using the coupler system. Subsequent regular graft perfusion. The muscle cuff can now be well integrated into the neck, resulting in a good position of the anastomosis, but also complete filling of the neck. Therefore, a caudal rubber flap is inserted later. Careful two-layer wound closure. Finally, the tracheotomy is performed. In this case, post-tracheotomy at the beginning of the year. Opening of the skin scar, cutting of scars. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Reopening of the trachea in the former area between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring, followed by insertion of the muco-cutaneous anastomosis and problem-free reintubation onto a size 8 low cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. The procedure was then completed with a vital graft. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT4a cN2b tongue margin and tongue base carcinoma on the left. If the graft heals properly, the first attempts at swallowing can be started from the 8th postoperative day. Left cervical swelling due to the clear muscle cuff, please consult the surgeons before manipulation. Due to the extent of the tumor, adjuvant RCT appears to be urgently required.

CT imaging showed a large lymph node metastasis measuring at least 4 cm in level II on the right, which was relatively close to the primary, in the tonsil region with a circumscribed transition to the base of the tongue. In addition, further conspicuous lymph nodes in level II on CT, therefore a cN2b neck status. No evidence of distant metastases. Indication for primary surgical treatment, in case of extensive defect also indication for defect coverage by radial artery graft.","After intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, the patient is positioned. First of all, PEG insertion: for this purpose, insertion with a flexible gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy to see through to the stomach. This appears regular and free. With a regular diaphanoscopy, the stomach is punctured without any problems and the PEG tube is inserted using the usual suture pull-through method. This was without any problems. No abnormalities on inspection of the oesophagus, apart from a few tablet residues. First, a pharyngo/laryngoscopy was performed to determine the extent of the tumor: an exophytic and ulcerated tumor was found in the area of the left tonsil lobe, which was largely limited to the tonsil region. In the area of the right edge of the tongue, superficial fleshy, reddish tissue, questionable as a tumor extension, which shows no deep infiltration on palpation. Relatively good mobility on palpation of the tumor, no deep infiltration. Free posterior pharyngeal wall, no growth towards the nasopharynx. Further tongue base, vallecula and epiglottis are free. The caudal tonsil is relatively fleshy. Here rather no tumor growth. Therefore, we now turn to primary enoral resection. Expose the tumor with the tonsil retractor and the Jennings retractor while looping the tongue. Inclusion of the entire anterior palatal arch to gain an overview. Resection to just parauvular. Therefore good mobilization of the tumour. Resection of the tumor in toto with removal of muscles in the area of the posterior palatal arch. Here the tumor is smoothly bordered and encapsulated, without tissue adherence. Relatively easy detachment without capsular injury. Caudal resection is also problem-free. The fleshy change in the area of the right or posterior right edge of the tongue is now removed with a safety margin of a good 1 cm. Free conditions in the depth here. Removal of approx. 1/2 cm of muscle cuff. Circumscribed resection of the glossotonsillar groove. However, this otherwise remains largely intact. There is also no resection towards the floor of the mouth. Involvement of the entire tonsil including the caudal change. Therefore resection up to the level of the epiglottis. Minutious hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. After extirpation of the tumor, re-inspection. In the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, a macroscopically narrow resection distance can be seen medially. The capsule of the tumor can be seen circumscribed caudally. However, there is no breakthrough or open tissue. Therefore, a complete resection was first made in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall and parauvularly up to the caudal margin. Now insert the entire specimen, which is marked on all sides, and the resected specimen for frozen section diagnostics. With a short resection distance in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, the post-resection is now exposed here. Basally in the cranial part, the resection distance is very short here with the capsule partially exposed, as described. The resection margin in the area of the anterior palatal arch is also narrow, otherwise the resection margins are macroscopically and microscopically tumor-free on all sides, especially in the area of the tongue. Therefore, at a later stage, a resection and a final margin specimen are formed in the area of the entire anterior palatal arch and in the area of the wound bed in the area of the posterior palatal arch, covering it completely. The final marginal sample is diagnosed as tumor-free at both sites in the frozen section diagnostics. Therefore, no further measures are required. Minutious hemostasis and check for blood dryness. On palpation, even before the necks are performed, a clear soft tissue mantle is still visible in addition to the clearly palpable metastasis in level II on the right. Therefore, we now turn to the neck dissections, starting with the neck dissection on the left: After repositioning and instillation of xylocaine with the addition of adrenaline, start on the left side: curved skin incision submandibularly and on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the facial vein and the cervical vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein after prior exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Subsequent evacuation of level V with careful protection of the plexus branches. No evidence of lymphatic leakage caudally. Subsequent careful wound inspection and wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and, if wound conditions are dry and level IIa to V is completely evacuated, insertion of a 10 Redon drain in the case of clinical cN0 aspect and later careful two-layer wound closure after checking again for blood dryness. Turning now to the opposite side: Here also skin incision, submandibularly curved at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Palpation of the metastasis, which is mainly located in level IIa, appears to measure approx. 4 x 5 cm and is relatively easy to move with the surrounding area. Palpatorily no infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle or adherence to other structures. Therefore, visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at level II of the metastasis on the muscle without signs of muscle infiltration for ............. a safety margin. Inclusion of a circumscribed muscle cuff. Expose the omohyoid muscle at this point. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with exposure and preservation of the facial vein, the hypoglossal nerve and the superior thyroid artery. Ansa cervicalis was removed here. Now free preparation of the internal jugular vein. The large mass is seen in level IIa, lying directly on the vein in the area of the jugulofacial angle, but here there is no evidence of infiltration with strict vascular dissection. In addition, level III, located directly on the internal jugular vein, shows a nodular lymph node change measuring approx. 2 x 2 1/2 cm. Confirmation of the CT findings. Visualization of the accessorius nerve. The metastasis lies on the nerve, but clearly does not infiltrate it. The metastasis can be easily detached from the nerve. After complete visualization of the digastric muscle, detachment from the metastasis is also possible. Good caudal detachment from the caudal parotid pole. Here only adjacent metastasis, no evidence of infiltration. Overall metastasis limited to the lymph node, measuring approx. 4 x 5 cm, which is removed in toto. Finally, the accessorius triangle was removed, carefully sparing the nerves, and Levl V was removed, carefully sparing the plexus, with no evidence of lymphatic leakage. Now, after complete removal of the neck resectate, inspection of the wound cavities, especially palpation towards level IIa, towards the tonsil lobe. Here, palpation also reveals a clear soft tissue mantle and a well-protected carotid artery. Findings demo and case discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Due to the non-penetrating defect of the stable soft tissue mantle, confirmation of the extent and also no indication for radial flap coverage. Therefore, careful inspection of the wound surfaces. Irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. If the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. The previously dictated resections are now carried out. Final wound inspection. After meticulous hemostasis, the wound is dry. A relatively large wound area is now visible. After resection of the anterior palatal arch, resection towards the soft palate, resection up to the posterior pharyngeal wall and resection in the area of the pharynx caudal to the level of the epiglottis as well as circumscribed resection of the edge of the tongue. Due to the large wound area and extent, the decision was made to perform a protective tracheostomy. Prior to this, the wound surfaces in the area of the tongue edge are adapted with 3.0 Vicryl. Also adaptation of muscle cords in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall and parauvular tissue. Finally, inspection under dry conditions. Finally, perform the tracheotomy: modified Kocher collar incision, approx. 1 cm below the relatively deep cricoid cartilage. Very short distance between jugulum and cricoid cartilage. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. A very strong, pronounced vein is seen subcutaneously, almost the caliber of an internal jugular vein. This is exposed, ligated and ligated. Further exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Entering the linea alba. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. The glandular isthmus is relatively weakly developed and is coagulated. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Finally, problem-free transfer to an 8 mm tracheoflex cannula and completion of the procedure at this point. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT2 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right with protective tracheostomy and extensive resection area, but with good conditions for primary wound healing. After a swallowing test, a liquid diet can be started from the 3rd postoperative day. If swallowing function and wound development are normal, decannulation may be possible from the 5th to 7th postoperative day.

The arytenoid cartilage of the left side also appears to be infiltrated by the tumor, so that the above-mentioned indication for surgery was given.","After induction of intubation anesthesia, repeat microlaryngoscopy and check of the tumor extent, which has not changed since the previous examination. Then injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline and transverse skin incision over the thyroid cartilage. Layer-by-layer preparation in depth. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage surface reveals the tumor that has migrated through. This exposes the entire thyroid cartilage surface and the cricoid cartilage. Then open the thyroid cartilage paramedian on the right with the wheel. Then make a vertical incision paramedian on the left with the wheel. Now push off the periosteum, initially on the left side. Then also a little on the right side. Then open the endolarynx paramedian on the right. The tumor on the left is clearly visible here. The tumor is now first removed from the right vocal fold with a safety margin of 2-3 mm and dissected to the left side. There, resection of the entire anterior commissure en bloc with the attached thyroid cartilage and resection of the endolarynx on the left side at the glottis level up to the subglottic level and up to the middle level of the pouch ligament on the left side. It can be seen that the tumor clearly infiltrates the ary, so that this is disarticulated and also removed. The tumor is then removed at the interarytaenoid muscles. A marginal sample is taken here. Similarly, removal of marginal samples in the area of the margin on the right side. It then becomes apparent that the tumor possibly extends to the cricoid cartilage here, so here too cricoid cartilage is initially removed basally and ventrally. The dorsal edge sample and the edge sample in the interarytaenoid area are not diagnosed as reliably tumor-free, so a resection is performed here. A second marginal sample is then taken from the dorsal area of the cricoid cartilage and the interarytaenoid muscles. These are then found to be tumor-free intraoperatively. Therefore, the cricoid cartilage plate and the articular surface of the cricoarytaenoid joint are now abraded. The tumor is thus resected in consideration of the marginal specimens R0. The incision is then made further caudally in front of the trachea and dissected in layers in depth. Separation of the infralaryngeal musculature. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is first undermined and then cut on both sides. Repeated exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Then open the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage rod. Preparation of a Björk flap and subsequent circular mucocutaneous anastomosis of the tracheostoma. Then reintubation. After subtle endolaryngeal hemostasis, readaptation of the pouch ligament on the left side and of the vocal fold and pouch ligament on the right side, which are fixed to the thyroid cartilage framework with PDS sutures. The thyroid cartilage surface is covered with a dorsally pedicled mucosal flap. The same applies to the articular surface of the arytaenoid joint on the left side. Then check the bleeding again. Then adaptation and suturing of the two thyroid cartilage surfaces. A small remaining gap is closed with prelaryngeal muscle pedicled from the left. A wound flap is then inserted and the wound is closed in two layers. After applying a dressing and inserting a nasogastric feeding tube, the procedure is completed. In the case of cN0 neck status, neck dissection is not performed on both sides. The patient was shielded intraoperatively with intravenous antibiotics with Unacid, which should be continued until the 3rd postoperative day. An attempt to swallow is possible after about 8 days. Until then, the patient should be fed via the nasogastric feeding tube. Depending on the result of the swallowing test, the patient can then be given a diet or swallowing training.","Partial laryngeal resection, Tracheostomy

In CT and ultrasound, midline crossing to the right, in CT approx. 1/2 cm, in sonogram slightly above. Size approx. 2 x 3 cm.","This is followed by pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The tumorous process is visible, which extends from the left pharyngoepiglottic plica over the base of the tongue and vallecula area to the midline to the right by about 1 cm. Involvement of the vallecula, the left epiglottis and the caudal base of the tongue. Deep tumor crater to the left. Laser resection now follows: positioning of the tumor with a spreading laryngoscope. The tumor is removed macroscopically at a distance of approx. 1 cm on all sides in healthy tissue. Resection extends from the right paramedian to the left just below the tonsil lobe. The entire base of the tongue is resected caudally and the hyoid bone is exposed, almost over the entire plane. Complete vallecular resection, resection of the left mucosa of the epiglottis except for a small region just in front of the point of envelope. The specimen is removed, thread-marked and sent for frozen section. In addition, a wide mass from the entire cranial region is sent in. The specimen is relatively scarce in the cranial direction, but is well covered by the cranial margin specimen, which is healthy. Tumor cells are still scattered laterally to the right and especially caudally to the right. However, intraepithelial lymphangiosis is also detectable towards the depth. Therefore another resection to the right, very carefully so as not to damage the lingual artery. The left lingual artery had already been closed with clips. Resection of this 1 cm wide strip with underlying soft tissue now follows. Resection extends from right lateral cranial to right lateral caudal, including the lateral parts of the epiglottis. Strip is sent in, no more tumor infiltrates here. Thus an overall R0 situation. Careful hemostasis is now performed. Resection was performed using a 5-6 watt superpulse laser. The patient is now transferred for modified radical neck dissection and tracheostomy. First decision to insert a PEG tube in the typical manner. This is done without complications using the suture pull-through method with adequate diaphanoscopy. A neck dissection is then performed on the right side. Creation of a skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure in the depth of the nervus accessorius, the omohyoid muscle and the digaster muscle. Dissection of the above-mentioned structures revealed several highly visible masses in regions II to V b, partly with the sternocleidomastoid muscle caudally with the omohyoid muscle, especially the masses in regions IV and V b were broadly adjacent to the internal jugular vein. First attempt to dissect along the cervical vascular sheath. Difficult dissection, scarred conditions. Exposure and protection of the vagus nerve and the common carotid artery. Removal of the posterior neck specimen together with the highly suspicious mass in regions II to IV while sparing the above-mentioned structures. Removal of fibers of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the neck preparation. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Protection of the deep plexus branches. Then concentrate on the highly suspicious mass in regions IV and V b. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle. Inclusion of fibers of the omohyoid muscle in the preparation. Heavily scarred conditions. It is then possible to first find a layer on the internal jugular vein and then to detach the large conglomerate of Regio IV and V b from the internal jugular vein. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Subsequent removal of the anterior neck specimen. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation using hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Placement of a 10 Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Now repositioning of the patient to perform a neck dissection on the left side. Sonographic cN3 neck status with a large mass over 6 cm in regions II and III and two small, highly suspicious masses, cystically altered, in regions IV and V b. Creation of a skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin, the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Expose and dissect along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. In this step, the N3 metastasis in regions II and III is already encountered, which appears cystically altered. Dissection along this mass in regions II and III, exposing the posterior belly of the digastric muscle and the capsule of the submandibular gland, which is removed from the specimen. Inclusion of fibers of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the preparation. The nervus accessorius cannot be preserved due to clear infiltration and is removed with the preparation. Subcutaneous tissue from region V and muscle fibers of the scalene muscles are included in the preparation. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Subsequent dissection from cranial to caudal. Removal of the neck specimen together with the highly suspicious mass in region IV. Very careful, laborious dissection in region V b. Removal of the neck specimen in toto. Extensive hemostasis in region V b using bipolar coagulation. Exposure and protection of the neck vessel sheath. Extremely difficult dissection in region V b. This results in a small tear in the internal jugular vein, which is immediately treated using Vascufil suture 6-0. Removal of the anterior neck specimen. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Placement of a 10 Redon drain and two-layer wound closure and completion of the neck dissection on the left side. Due to the large wound area ..... and the left vallecula and the expected pronounced dysphagia, the decision was made to perform a tracheostomy in the typical manner. Creation of a skin incision directly below the level of the cricoid cartilage, approx. 3 cm long. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Exposure of the anterior wall of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus using Pean clamps. Separation of the thyroid isthmus and ligation of both thyroid stumps. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Creation of a tracheal incision between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasp. Creation of a Björk flap in the typical manner and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Reintubation to a size 8 Rügheim tracheostomy tube. Completion of the procedure without complications. Transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit. Feeding for at least 1 week via PEG tube, then cautious diet build-up. Due to the overall situation, postoperative RCT should certainly be discussed in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Laser resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy

The patient was therefore also informed about an external approach.,"Preoperative loupe laryngoscopy showed regular vocal fold mobility on the left side. After anesthesia and intubation with the laser tube through the anesthesia, the first step was microlaryngoscopy: Here, the tumor described above was seen, partly exophytic, partly exulcerated, affecting the entire vocal fold and growing into the morgue sinus. Palpatorily quite coarse and growing into the anterior commissure, also a clearly subglottic growth of approx. 1 cm caudally. The upper part of the pocket folds is certainly well free, the arytenoid cartilage of the left side is also free. The left vocal fold does not appear to be affected. Therefore, after consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, a laser resection will now be attempted. The tumor is first reduced in size in its anterior region. However, it turned out that it was not possible to create a good overview in the anterior commissure area and that there was significant subglottic growth in this area, which also justified the classification cT2 in any case. Therefore, after consulting <CLINICIAN_NAME> again, the decision was made to perform a partial laryngectomy from the outside. Now procedure for partial laryngeal resection via thyrotomy: Zigzag incision. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. First spread the omohyoid muscle. Then identify the anterior edge of the thyroid cartilage. Two lymph nodes up to 1 cm in size are now identified in the area between the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage, which correspond to the Delphi lymph nodes. These are now resected in the sense of a selective level VI lymph node resection and sent separately for final histology. After exposing the perichondrium of the cartilage, the perichondrium is now slit paramedially on the right and then pushed to the left side with the Freer, and the thyroid cartilage is split with the wheel in the sense of a thyreotomy. Now open the inside of the larynx in the superior region. The right paramedian incision is also made at the glottic level. Now spread open the larynx with the retractor. An approx. 2 cm large tumor is revealed, which is now resected under direct vision. The inner side of the perichondrium is also removed in depth with the freer, the incision is extended caudally at the level of the cricoid cartilage and a large part of the pocket fold is resected cranially. Posteriorly, the resection includes the vocalis process of the arytenoid cartilage. The vocalis muscle on the left side is of course completely resected. Now turn to the right side. Here there is slightly irregular tissue in the most anterior area of the right vocal fold, which is why a very circumscribed resection is performed here. Now 4 quick incisions are made, once inferior and superior, once in the arytenoid area and then in the area of the right vocal fold, all of which are later found to be tumor-free. Now most careful hemostasis with bipolar coagulation and even after increasing the blood pressure to 145/90 there is no bleeding. Together with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, a tracheostomy is now dispensed with. The Keel is now inserted after making 4 small drill holes with the Lindemann burr. Then readaptation of the cranial and caudal gaps of the keel using the perichondrium and connective tissue. Readaptation of the musculature, creation of a flap and two-layer wound closure. Intraoperative administration of 250 mg SDH and 600 mg Sobelin. Patient should be presented at the tumor conference and in any case undergo a control microlaryngoscopy with Keel removal in 8 weeks.","Initially laser resection, then partial resection (Leroux Robert), ND

To do this, adjust the entrance to the larynx with the laryngoscope. Insert the 0° scope. The right arytenoid cusp is clearly swollen, oedematous, very narrow glottic gap. The subglottic space, the trachea up to the bifurcation and the visible main bronchi are unremarkable. After intubation, an esophagoscopy is performed and the flexible esophagoscope is inserted into the stomach. Conditions there are unremarkable. No evidence of a tumor in the area of the cardia even when looking backwards. Diaphanoscopy, insertion of the PEG using the thread pull-through method. The esophagus is usually checked again when the endoscope is withdrawn. No evidence of a second tumor. Problem-free PEG placement. Pharyngoscopy: Adjustment of the small bore tube. As described above, the exophytic growing tumor can be seen in the area of the right aryepiglottic fold merging with the upper piriform sinus. The rest of the right piriform sinus and the entire left piriform sinus and the postcricoid region are unremarkable. The esophageal entrance is clear. The base of the tongue, epiglottis and valecula are unremarkable. In addition, microlaryngoscopy only shows edematous conditions on the right side in the region of the laryngeal head. This is probably submucosal tumor growth. The vocal folds are, as far as can be seen, unremarkable. The supraglottic region on the left is also unremarkable. The base of the tongue is soft on palpation. After completion of the panendoscopy, detailed consultation with the anesthesiologist regarding the further procedure. Preparation for laryngectomy. The tumor is resectable. Perioperative administration of Unacid. Continue this postoperatively. Skin disinfection, infiltration anesthesia for the apron flap. Neck dissection on the right side first. Make an incision from the earlobe to the supraclavicular area. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle and cut off the external jugular vein. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, digasticus muscle, posterior vena cava. Now dissection of the posterior part of the neck from the accessorius area to the supraclavicular area. Overall very difficult dissection conditions due to the very voluminous conditions. At least two suspicious nodes on this side, especially in the vein angle. Further dissection in the direction of the venous angle. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, the cervical nerve. This will be cut later. Expose the external, internal and common carotid artery and the superior laryngeal artery. This is stitched. Now complete the anterior neck preparation, including the capsule of the submandibular gland. Separate the common carotid artery, the thyroid gland and the larynx. Now perform the neck dissection on the left side. Also make a skin incision from infraauricular to supraclavicular. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, cut off the external jugular vein. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, the accessorius nerve and the vagus nerve. Dissection of the digasticus muscle, posterior venter and dissection of the posterior neck preparation from cranial to caudal to supraclavicular on the left side. After cutting through the caudal end, repositioning to prevent a fistula. Now expose the common, external and internal carotid artery. Separation and ligation of the superior vein. Exposure of the hyperglossal nerve, completion of the anterior neck preparation including the capsule of the submandibular gland. Very difficult preparation conditions on this side due to the voluminous conditions. Complete the neck preparation on the left side. Now join the two neck incisions and dissect an apron flap cranially up to the hyoid. Expose the laryngeal skeleton on both sides and free preparation of the piriform sinus on both sides, detachment from the thyroid cartilage. Now cut the infrahyoid muscles and enter the pharynx just above the epiglottis. Grasp the epiglottis and resect the mucosa in the area of the aryepiglottic fold on both sides up to the intraaryhaenoid region. The tumor is located on the right side. Here, the piriform sinus is partially incised and the post-crecoid region is then reached again from the other side, from the caudal side. Clinically, the resection is performed in sano. Push the postcrecoid region caudally. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, separation of the larynx from the pharynx. Sever the connection between the larynx and trachea. The laryngectomy specimen now removed is sent for definitive histology. Representative marginal samples are taken. These are described as mild dysplasia in the frozen section. No carcinoma in situ, no invasive carcinoma. A Provox prosthesis is then placed. This was relatively successful with good visibility. Somewhat difficult threading in the area of the trachea. In the end, however, the Provox prosthesis fits well. Extensive hemostasis with H2O2 and bipolar coagulation. Irrigation with H2O2 solution and Ringer's solution. No more bleeding. Now perform the pharyngeal suture, initially caudally and cranially and then also in the middle section of the pharynx. Complete closure. Repeat several times and three-layer wound closure in the area of the pharynx. Reapproximation of the infrahoidal musculature in the area of the hyoid bone. Suture the trachea as a tracheostoma into the skin flap and supraclavicularly. Now clean the neck again on both sides, rinse with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. No bleeding. Insertion of a Redon drain on both sides. Subcutaneous suture, skin suture and wound dressing. A feeding tube was inserted preoperatively. This should serve as a nasogastric tube for splinting for a few days. Insertion of a tracheal cannula, which is fixed with stitches. Completion of the procedure. No bleeding, no other special features. Pass on antibiotics postoperatively. Finally, another detailed consultation with the anesthetist. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Overall difficult preparation conditions due to the very voluminous conditions.

As confirmed by loupe laryngoscopy, the function of this is also restricted. Furthermore, it can be seen that the tumor extends from the dorsal end of the right vocal fold cranially, i.e. supraglottically, towards the arytenoid hump, which has become distended and edematous. The pocket fold on the right side is raised but not indurated. The left-sided glottis is free. Subglottic also free. Otherwise, no noticeable tumor growth postcricoidally or in either piriform sinus. Now start with the laser resection: Adjustment of the tumor, first of all of the anterior commissure with the Kleinsasser B-tube and cutting around the anterior commissure, starting at the very anterior left vocal fold margin, then transfer to the anterior commissure through Broyl's tendon and detachment of the right tumorous vocal fold from the anterior commissure and from the subglottic slope. Now reposition and enter with the spread laryngoscope and then remove the right-sided pocket fold in order to obtain a view. It turns out that this is a good idea, as the tumor continues to move in the direction of the morgue sinus. The tumor is now sharply incised with the laser beam at a power of initially 5 and later 7 watts. The tumor is removed in toto, continuing from the loosened anterior commissure to the dorsal side. Now remove the tumor portion of the right vocal fold in toto and remove it. The right arytenoid area and right supraglottis are then repositioned. The tumor is then first resected macroscopically far into the healthy tissue using a laser beam. The vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage is resected. Subsequent inspection. It becomes apparent that there are still clinical tumor remnants in the area of the arytenoid cartilage, so that the arytenoid cartilage is now resected with the laser beam. Now clinical absence of tumor and hemostasis with the monopolar and by means of supratupfer. Marginal samples were taken from the anterior commissure, from the right former pocket fold and from the right subglottic plane, also from the former right glottic area and from the right arytenoid area. In the course of the operation, these marginal samples were all found to be tumor-free in the frozen section, but it should be noted that no epithelium was visible in the frozen section in the area of the right glottis and the right supraglottis. Intermediate demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Now repositioning for neck dissection, first on the right: injection of 10 ml xylocaine with added adrenaline in the area of the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid on the right after abjoding. Followed by a curved skin incision, cutting through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Expose the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the accessorius nerve, the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve after cutting through the omohyoid muscle. The posterior neck preparation is then detached from the plexus branches and removed after release from the upper accessorius triangle. The accessorius nerve is preserved. Now complete the anterior neck, including resection of the capsule of the submandibular gland and exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. The vagus nerve and the common carotid artery remain untouched. Then hemostasis with bipolar forceps, hydrogen and Ringer irrigation. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure.

The above-mentioned operation was therefore indicated. The patient was also informed about the possible need for flap surgery.,"(<CLINICIAN_NAME>) Pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The exophytic tumor is visible, which leads from the anterior palatal arch via the tonsillar lobe, the alveolar ridge and the floor of the mouth to the edge and base of the tongue. Attempt at PEG insertion: Insertion with the esophagoscope. Advance into the stomach. However, diaphanoscopy cannot be established here and PEG placement cannot be carried out with sufficient certainty. The attempt to insert a PEG is therefore discontinued. If necessary, this would then have to be performed secondarily in surgery or internal medicine. Alternate positioning of the head and insertion of the McIvor blade or retractor. Exposure of the tumor. This runs from the anterior palatal arch over the alveolar ridge onto the floor of the mouth to the base of the tongue, which infiltrates minimally, with anterior infiltration of the edge of the tongue on the right. A tumor cone can also be felt in the edge of the tongue, individual satellites at the transition to the floor of the mouth. The tumor is now resected with a safety margin of at least 1 ˝ cm on all sides. The anterior palatal arch and the soft tissues above the alveolar ridge are removed, although the periosteal layer can be preserved here. The resection also includes the tonsil lobe with adjacent musculature, transition to the floor of the mouth, where the lingual nerve is exposed but can be preserved, as can the Wharton's duct. The resection leads over the floor of the mouth into the edge of the tongue, which is resected over a width of 1 to 2 cm in the posterior region, as is a small part of the base of the tongue. The preparation is thread-marked. Another separate marginal sample from the basal area of the tongue margin is also taken, here including a large slice of muscle. Both the entire specimen and the marginal specimen in healthy tissue, thus R0 resection in a frozen section. Indication for flap creation borderline. Due to the preserved posterior palatal arch, the coverage of the bone in the ascending mandibular branch and the still well-preserved mucosal area in the area of the glossoalveolar groove, the decision was made not to perform a flap here. Therefore, repositioning for neck dissection on both sides. (V. Bezas) Neck dissection on both sides and temporary tracheostomy. Initial repositioning for neck dissection on the right. Curved skin incision in typical manner. After cutting through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma, expose the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

Including exposure of the vagus nerve. Further dissection to the cranial side, here the hypoglossal nerve and the hypoglossal sac are exposed under the digastric muscle. Exposure of the nervus accessorius and free preparation of the neck dissectate from cranial to caudal. Further successive dissection and entrainment of the nodes from level II to V. The branches of the cervical plexus are preserved. Subtle hemostasis. Creation of a Redon drainage. Two-layer suture. Now proceed to neck dissection on the left side. Here the dissection is carried out in the usual way as on the right side. Here, however, with cN0 sonographic findings, the neck dissection is performed at levels II to IV. After careful hemostasis, irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Application of a Redon drainage. Two-layer suture. Now proceed to permanent tracheostomy. Small Kocher's collar incision approximately 2 transverse fingers above the jugulum on the palpatory cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutis.

A trial excision is made at a distance of 0.3 mm from the edge of the tumor. Targeted bipolar coagulation of the irradiating blood vessels. Further dissection caudally until the lingual nerve is identified. The lingual nerve extends into the mass, making transection necessary. Further gentle conditions in the area of the sublingual curcule and preservation of the Wharton's duct. After resection, demonstration on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Decision on primary wound closure. A circular marginal sample 0.3 mm wide is taken, marked and sent for histological analysis. Another thin sample was taken from the tip of the tongue. Primary defect closure. Positioning of the patient for gross needle puncture: sterile washing and covering of the surgical site. Preparation of the gross needle puncture set. Identification of the largest nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Incision of the skin through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. A coarse needle puncture (4x) of the largest nodule, cranial pole of the right thyroid lobe is performed under ultrasound guidance. Hemostasis by means of short-lasting compression and wound dressing. The surgical procedure was completed without complications. Conclusion: A trial excision of the broad-based, verrucous, exophytically growing tumor at the base of the tongue/under the tongue on the right is performed. Primary closure of the defect with preservation of the Wharton's duct. Gross needle aspiration of the largest nodule in the cranial pole of the right scabrous gland. Further procedure after receipt of the histology. Postoperative antibiotic treatment with Unacid 3x3 g and Clont 3x 500 mg should be continued for the next three days. Soft food, analgesics if required.","Resection, Plastic reconstruction, and Panendoscopy

Now indication for surgical therapeutic resection transorally, depending on the intraoperative extent with flap coverage.","Initially start with PEG insertion: For this purpose, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. If the diaphanoscopy is excellent, the stomach is punctured without any problems and the PEG tube is inserted using the usual thread pull-through method. Inspection of the oesophagus during reflection, inconspicuous conditions here. Now insertion with the small water tube, later supported with the TE blocker. A whitish, coarse, exophytic tumor of the right tonsil is seen, which clearly extends caudally, spreads to the posterior palatal arch in the lower half and leaves the tonsil lobe caudally and grows onto the oropharyngeal side wall up to the border of the hypopharyngeal side wall. Growth over the glossotonsillar groove circumscribed to the base of the tongue. Here also circumscribed infiltration of the base of the tongue. Posterior pharyngeal wall and soft palate are free. Now demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Due to the extent, confirmation of the indication for radial flap coverage, combined resection transorally and transcervically due to the growth. Start now with transoral resection: Initially transoral resection as for tumor TE, including the anterior palatal arch. Good overview. Exclusion of growth towards the pterygoid muscles. The posterior palatal arch can be well preserved cranially. Resection to parauvular. Here, however, no resection of the soft palate. Caudal removal of the posterior palatal arch. Now resection of the part of the glossotonsillar groove with complete removal of the glossotonsillar groove. Resection of the base of the tongue. Here, however, further resection of the base of the tongue transcervically for a better overview. Now carry out covering edge samples in the area of the soft palate, the posterior palatal arch and the buccal transition. These are completely tumor-free in the frozen section examination. Therefore, repositioning for neck dissection and completion of the tumor resection. Curved skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side after injection of xylocaine with adrenaline. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma and creation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. Palpation of 2 coarse lymph nodes level II/III located in the area of the jugulofacial angle, certainly without infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with preservation of the superior thyroid and the facial vein, which is very pronounced here. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Difficult preparation conditions in the area of the metastasis. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Protection and preservation of the nerve. Difficult preparation conditions in the area of the metastases in the area of the internal jugular vein. Certainly no infiltration here, but vulnerable vascular conditions and two tears. Suture and ligature, but with preservation of continuity of the vein. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus. Removal of the neck preparation en bloc. Now also evacuation of level Ib with infiltration of the glossotonsillar groove close to the posterior floor of the mouth. Subcapsular dissection of the submandibular gland. Extirpation of several lymph nodes measuring up to 1.5 cm. Removal of the gland. Final palpation. In free conditions, resection of the digastric muscle with planned flap coverage. Now orientate the digastric muscle at the posterior upper edge of the hyoid. Entering the oral cavity in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth. Widening of the pharyngotomy. Exposure of the resected edge of the tongue and the lateral wall of the pharynx. Now a good overview of the remaining tumor. Resection of the tumor in the area of the base of the tongue generously with circumscribed nodular infiltration in the area of the base of the tongue. Widening of the muscle cuff and later removal of a marginal sample. Resection of the tumor. Inspection. Findings demo to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. It can now be seen that the tumor in the area of the caudal pharyngeal wall is somewhat narrowly resected macroscopically on the specimen, as well as at the site in the area of the base of the tongue, where the safety margin was already widened during dissection. A generous resection is now taken at both sites together with the thread-marked main preparation and sent for frozen section diagnostics. Here, the tumor is classified as R0 on the specimen, but with narrow resection margins in the area of the caudal pharyngeal wall and in the area of the tongue. However, the resections here are completely tumor-free, meaning that the resection is R0 overall. Now measuring the graft. A 9 x 7 cm graft is later lifted, taking into account the resection area on the tongue and the resection of the glossotonsillar groove. Now continue to perform the neck dissection on the right side in parallel and remove the radialis graft in the area of the left forearm. First perform the neck dissection. Skin incision and cutting of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical artery of the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Here, several lymph nodes that are macroscopically conspicuous in size and number, which are not yet primarily metastatic. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the accessorius nerve and the cervical plexus branches. Final check. Irrigation of the wound. In dry conditions, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Now to lift the radial implant. After applying the tourniquet and marking the graft, cut around it while lifting a skin monitor. Expose the cephalic vein to take the vein with you. Perform the Hayden maneuver and expose the superficial radial nerve ramus. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle strictly subfascial to the dissection. Ligation of the pedicle. Further meticulous sufascial dissection with clipping of distal vessels close to the stalk. A relatively high brachial artery with a very strong ulnar artery can now be seen in the crook of the elbow. This is visualized and preserved. The proximal radial artery stump is relatively weak. Exposure of the outlet of the interosseous artery. This is preserved. Exposure of the venous bridge between the deep radial system and the cephalic vein, which is strongly pronounced. Separation of the veins while carefully preserving the bridge. Reopening of the tourniquet and minute hemostasis. Excellent flap vitality and after hemostasis removal of the graft after ligation of the radial artery with preservation of the interosseous artery and removal of the cephalic vein. In the meantime, the tracheotomy was also performed. Horizontal skin incision for this. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Ligation of the isthmus and transection. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Finally, easy transfer to an 8 mm tracheoflex cannula and suturing of the same. Now, first of all, placement of sutures transcervically in the area of the base of the tongue and in the area of the caudal pharyngeal wall. First incorporate the graft transorally. This works well. Good fit. Reconstruction of the anterior palatal arch, glossotonsillar groove and lateral pharyngeal wall. Further transzevical incorporation. Suturing in the area of the vallecula, the base of the tongue and the pharyngeal side wall under moderate tension. Now placement of the vascular pedicle. Suture the skin monitor caudally with a very long vascular pedicle. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery. The superior thyroid artery must now be shortened several times in order to achieve a thickness of approximately the same caliber. However, the vessel is very tortuous, and despite multiple positioning of the Acland clamps and the vascular pedicle, the angulation is unfavorable. Therefore extremely difficult anastomization conditions. Performing an anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. Finally, regular anastomization despite extremely difficult conditions. After reopening the clamps, regular venous return and good flap vitality. Now, after vascular preparation of the facial vein and the radial vein, perform the venous anastomosis with a size 4 coupler. This works well with a strong radial vessel and a very strong facial vein. Immediate good blood circulation and regular vitality. Overall, however, a tendency to displacement due to the long course of the vessel or stalk. Therefore careful placement. Careful two-layer wound closure. During the final check, a pale graft is noticed which does not bleed after puncture. Therefore the decision is made to reopen the neck in case of arterial problems. Visualization of the arterial anastomosis with macroscopically normal venous anastomosis. There is no longer a transmitted pulse. The artery is therefore removed. A thrombus is now visible. Despite removal of the thrombus and repeated flushing, there is no more arterial bleeding. Therefore, this vessel is removed and an arterial anastomosis is performed again. Careful dissection. The facial artery was already removed during tumor dissection. Now expose a somewhat cranially located vascular outlet, most likely corresponding to the ascending pharyngeal artery and macroscopically largely equivalent in caliber. Exposure of the vessel. Intermediate involvement of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Now renewed vessel anastomization with 8.0 ethilon. Again, difficult suturing conditions due to the position of the vessel. Finally, however, regular flow, immediately good venous filling and regular flap vitality. Now, with regular vitality, wound closure in two layers. Final check and no further measures and transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit. A 10 x 6 cm full-thickness skin graft had already been removed from the right groin. Cutaneous preparation, mobilization of the subcutaneous tissue, careful two-layer wound closure after insertion of a 10 Redon drainage and finally careful incorporation of the full-thickness skin graft into the forearm. Two-layer wound closure and final application of a vacuum dressing and termination of the procedure at this point. Conclusion: Intraoperative cT3 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left with intraoperative R0 resection. Defect coverage using a radialis graft with difficult anastomization conditions due to the vessel position and the length of the stalk. Meticulous flap control postoperatively. On the 8th postoperative day, an X-ray pumice should be taken. If the flap conditions are intact, the patient can then be gradually fed and decannulated, depending on the swallowing function. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics of Unacid and a single dose of 250 mg SDH. After receiving the histology, presentation at our interdisciplinary tumor conference to plan the adjuvant therapy.","Pharyngectomy, Free flap (Radial)

PE from this area therefore indicated with frozen section diagnostics. In addition, the main diagnosis of hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the left was confirmed as squamous cell carcinoma. Pre-panendoscopy revealed the carcinoma in the area of a part of the left lateral wall, left anterior wall, lateral left aryepiglottic fold. Clinical and CT infiltration of the tumor in the space between the arytenoid cartilage, thyroid cartilage and cricoid cartilage. Laryngectomy therefore also indicated.","Transfer of the patient to the operating theater. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Team time-out. Positioning of the head and start of biopsy endonasal nasal inspection: positioning of the patient's head by the surgeon. Insertion of high inserts, which are removed again before the operation begins. There is a deviated septum to the right. The nasal cavity is adjusted with the speculum, initially inconspicuous conditions. Now enter the nasal cavity on the right side with 45° optics and lateralize the inferior turbinate. Careful medialization of the middle turbinate without fracturing it. A polypous mucosa is seen in the area of the middle nasal passage, which is resected with the blunt Blakesley. In addition, the middle turbinate is polypous and distended. The lateral part of the middle turbinate is carefully resected with the sharp Blakesley. The middle turbinate is not fractured. Overall, macroscopically non-suspicious conditions. The removed sample is sent to the pathology department for frozen section examination. After consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, it is an inflammatory polyp with no evidence of malignancy. Now completion of nasal inspection without complications or bleeding. Repositioning of the patient for pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: Insertion of the small bore tube size C and D again after insertion of a mouth guard. The described exophytic tumor can be seen, which runs laterally from the anterior area of the left lateral wall over the anterior wall to the area of the arytenoid fold and extends here to the arytenoid cartilage. Thickening at the back in the area between the arytenoid cartilage, cricoid cartilage and thyroid cartilage. Tumor infiltration can also be seen here on CT, which ultimately leads to the indication for laryngectomy. Initial PEG placement: adjustment of the esophageal inlet. Careful advancement with the flexible gastroesophagoscope into the stomach. Inspection of all sections of the stomach, which are unremarkable. Now perform the positive diaphanoscopy and insert the PEG tube in the usual manner using the thread pull-through method. Subsequent repositioning for laryngectomy and neck dissection on both sides: also cover the left forearm if radial flap is necessary. First of all, positioning and neck dissection on both sides. Neck dissection on the right: skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Subplatysmal dissection of the apron flap. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and discovery of the accessorius nerve. Now expose the omohyoid muscle and expose the medial edge. Dissect the submandibular gland and expose the posterior venter of the digastric muscle, sparing the marginal ramus until posterior to level IIb. Now open the cervical vascular sheath and expose the internal jugular vein and the facial vein. Protection of the cervical sinus and the hypoglossal nerve in the jugulofacial angle. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Clearing of level IIb, the accessorius nerve is unusually high here, but can be spared without any problems. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Removal of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the brachial plexus, the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the vagus nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Careful dissection of the caudal margin and careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Now also removal of the medial neck preparation. Neck dissection on the left: Positioning of the patient by the surgeon in a slightly reclined position. Injection of Suprarenin in the area of the skin incision. Now mark the skin incision and cut through the cutaneous-subcutaneous tissue. An apron flap is selected for the incision. Now cut through the platysma and subplatysmal dissection of the apron flap until the submandibular gland is exposed on both sides just above the hyoid bone. Approximation of the apron flap and identification of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Identification of the omohyoid muscle. Now dissection along the sternocleidomastoid muscle into the depths, exposing and sparing the branches of the cervical plexus. Now also identification of the accessorius nerve. Identification at the cranial end of the posterior venter of the digastric muscle and careful release of the neck dissection onto the muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and protection of the nerve. Displacement and at the end of the operation re-embedding of the accessorius nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Now dissection medially along the cervical vascular nerve sheath and detachment of the neck preparation from the cervical vascular nerve sheath. Then detachment of the neck preparation in regions II to IV while preserving the neuronal and vascular structures. Then laryngectomy and partial pharyngeal resection on the left: First dissection of the infrahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone. Fat and lymph node tissue, which lies in front of the infrahyoid musculature, is sent in separately as neck dissection level VI. Infrahyoid musculature is dissected and cut caudally. The superior cornu is released on the right, the constrictor is dissected. This is not possible on the left due to the tumor location. The thyroid gland is dissected caudolaterally on both sides, with a remnant still present on the right. In the isthmus area, a small, harder nodule is seen, which is also removed on the way to removal of the larynx. The left thyroid gland remnant with the cranial cystic mass is not touched and is dissected caudolaterally. The suprahyoid muscles are then dissected from the hyoid bone and beaten caudally with pre-epiglottic fatty tissue. Entering the pharynx, grasping the epiglottis. Successive detachment of the mucosa, which was previously dissected from the inside of the thyroid cartilage on the right side to preserve the piriform sinus. From the left side, the tumor is now cut around under direct vision with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm on all sides. This ultimately results in a partial pharyngeal resection that extends to the tip of the piriform sinus, but not quite to the end of the tip of the piriform sinus. The larynx is removed caudally, whereby the maximum mucosal width is also preserved postcricoidally. The larynx is finally removed caudally together with the tumor. Prior to this, a tracheotomy is created between the 1st and 2nd intercartilaginous spaces and re-intubation. Finally, the larynx is removed. Tumor with surrounding mucosa is marked with a suture. A marginal sample is taken from the left-lateral pharyngeal region, which is thread-marked and sent to the frozen section. There is still a small tumor nest in the frozen section towards the cranial side. Therefore, a resection is performed in the base of the tongue and cranial-lateral pharyngeal wall area, followed by removal of a marginal sample from this area. No more tumor in the marginal sample. Thus now R0 status. Assessment of the remaining pharynx. This can still be sutured well without becoming too tight. To improve the passage, after further dissection of the thyroid gland on the left side, a myotomy is performed in the area of the cricopharyngeal muscle and constrictor pharyngis laterally up to the mucosa. Length approx. 3 - 3.5 cm caudally. Subsequent insertion of an 8 mm Provox prosthesis at the typical site without complications. Then closure of the pharynx with the first layer of mucosa-inverting sutures using 4-0 or 3-0 Vicryl single-button sutures. A further layer is placed over this, also inverting with 4-0 or 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. A third layer can be sutured in the caudal and cranial region, which is not possible in the medial part due to the resection of the hypopharyngeal muscle. The nasogastric tube inserted at the beginning of the operation serves as a splint. The remainder of the infrahyoid musculature is sutured caudally via the pharyngo-oesophageal junction. The site is then irrigated and the bleeding carefully stopped. No bleeding at the end of the operation. Layered closure of the neck wound with insertion of a Redon drain on both sides and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Insertion of a 9 mm tracheostomy tube. Application of a pressure bandage. Completion of the procedure without complications. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist. Patient is extubated and transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring for 1 - 2 days. Overall cT4a hypopharyngeal carcinoma, whereby not the tumor size but the infiltration into the region between the arytenoid cartilage, cricoid cartilage and thyroid cartilage was decisive for the indication for laryngectomy. Please continue postoperative antibiotics with Unacid as already started intraoperatively. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube for 10 days, then X-ray pre-swallow and, if necessary, diet build-up. Wait for the final histology and discuss the further procedure in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, PEG placement, Tracheotomy

Then advance the 0° telescope through the glottic plane into the trachea. This is very difficult due to the exophytic tumor. Finally, however, the trachea and the bronchial system can be inspected up to the exit of the segmental bronchi. The mucosal conditions here are unremarkable. Intubation of the patient by the anesthetist. Inspection of the subglottis, glottis and supraglottis. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions on all sides. No abnormalities in the area of the right hypopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swallowing tract. No evidence of tumor manifestation in the postcricoid region either. Now inspection of the left swallowing duct. An exophytic tumor can be seen here, which extends into the piriform sinus at the lower pole of the tonsil without reaching the tip of the piriform sinus. Medially, the base of the tongue is reached, but is obviously not clinically infiltrated. Now advance the esophagoscope into the stomach. No evidence of malignant mucosal changes in the area of the esophagus. Now inspection of the oral cavity. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions. Pulling up the soft palate. No pathological changes here either. Now adjustment of the oropharynx and hypopharynx using the Lawson retractor. This shows the described space requirement, which is very difficult to adjust due to difficult mouth opening. Once the ............................... has been satisfactorily adjusted, laser resection can begin. This involves cutting around the tumour in the area of the lower tonsil pole and gradually mobilizing it. Due to the size of the tumor, it is not possible to remove it in its entirety in one piece; the tumor must be divided. In this case, it is also necessary to move the barring device and insert another barring device (spreading laryngoscope). This allows the tumor to be resected step by step, with the tumor resection extending in the area of the lateral pharyngeal wall towards the base of the tongue and reaching just above the piriform sinus on the left side. Removal of several marginal samples. These marginal samples are found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. Careful hemostasis and completion of the procedure. Further procedure depending on the histology. Final discussion with the anesthesiologist, in the sense of a consultation. The patient is transferred to the recovery ward.","Endoral laser resection and Panendoscopy

Start of lymph node extirpation. Palpatory identification of the conglomerate of nodes. Infiltration anesthesia is then performed after skin spray disinfection. Ablation of the surgical site. Sterile draping. Marking of the mandibular arch and the ascending mandibular branch. Mark the planned incision from the infralobular, laterocaudal, curved bayonet shape. Cut sharply through the cutis and subcutis. Dissection of the platysma. Dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the lymph node conglomerate. This lies lateral to the cervical vascular sheath. Cranially, the mass is directly adjacent to the accessorius nerve. Medially, the conglomerate extends to just before the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure, displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. Successive dissection of the conglomerate. Sending it for frozen section diagnostics. During the frozen section diagnosis by telephone, a squamous cell carcinoma is suspected. Therefore complete the neck dissection. Exposure of the posterior digastric venter muscle as the cranial border. Insertion of the retractors. Exposure of the internal jugular vein including the venous angle. Exposure of the common carotid artery and the bifurcation. Successive development of the lateral neck preparation with careful protection of the accessorius nerve and the plexus branches. With the exception of a small nodule in level III, there are no other suspicious nodules. Turning to the medial neck preparation. Here, too, no further suspicious nodes were found. As the intraparenchymal nodules located in the caudal parotid pole have already appeared sonographically constant for years, a further procedure is deliberately omitted here. Neuro-monitoring is used at the end of the operation to check the integrity of the accessory nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. The oral branch did not have to be visualized intraoperatively. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10-gauge redon drain. Subcutaneous suture with Vicryl 4-0 and skin suture with Ethilon 5-0. Application of a pressure bandage. Transition to panendoscopy. First positioning of the patient in head reclination. Insertion of the mouth guard. Enter with the size C small bore tube. First inspect the endolarynx. This appears unremarkable. Inspection of the piriform sinus. This is lined on both sides by smooth mucosa on all sides and can be freely unfolded up to the tip. The same applies to the postcricoid region and the esophageal entrance. A small retention cyst can be seen in the area of the vallecula on the left side. This is marsupialized. However, there is no evidence of malignancy here. This also applies to the base of the tongue and the corpus of the tongue. There is also no evidence of a tumor in the area of the oral cavity or the oral vestibule. Proceed to esophagogastroscopy. Insertion of the flexible endoscope under visualization and constant air insufflation into the stomach. A typical gastric mucosal relief can be seen on all sides. Inversion and inspection of the gastroesophageal junction. This also appears unremarkable. After desufflation, slow withdrawal of the endoscope with circular inspection of all sections of the esophagus. Here too, there is no evidence of malignancy. Removal of the flexible endoscope. First insertion of the McIvor oral spatula. Inspection of the left tonsil. A primarily suspicious area can be seen in the depth of the crypts just below the upper tonsil pole. If it is suspected that this could be the primary, the tumor tonsillectomy is now performed with the necessary safety margin. For this purpose, a parauvular incision and resection of the left tonsil including parts of the anterior and posterior palatal arch is performed first. Lateral dissection is performed up to the parapharyngeal fatty tissue. Exposure of the lower tonsil pole. The suture is marked before the tonsil is removed. Sending the tonsil for frozen section diagnostics. In the meantime, hemostasis is performed. During the frozen section diagnosis by telephone, an R0 resected tonsil carcinoma is found in the area of the left tonsil. A mucosoplasty is performed. With a dry wound bed, the operation is now completed without complications. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist.","Tonsillectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Panendoscopy

Histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma. CT diagnosis performed and flap coverage indicated.,"First, after preparation for anesthesia, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy or inspection of the oral cavity: The tumor is seen on the left edge of the tongue, extending to the front and side of the floor of the mouth, but not quite reaching the alveolar ridge. Subsequent transoral tumor resection: The tumor is macroscopically incised on all sides with a safety margin of 1.5 cm in the sense of a hemiglossectomy, whereby the base of the tongue is only partially resected. Resection extends forward to the floor of the mouth. Removal of the soft tissue from the bone. Removal of the external tongue muscles and sublingual gland as well as resection of the lingual nerve. Resection extends posteriorly to the posterior floor of the mouth including the glossoalveolar groove and parts of the base of the tongue. The specimen is removed and marked with a suture. A marginal sample is taken from the mucosa at the front and sides of the alveolar ridge as well as a marginal sample of basal tissue. In the frozen section, both tumor and margin samples are free of carcinoma. Thus R0 resection. Careful hemostasis. Now repositioning for continuation of the operation. First tracheostoma creation (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): A horizontal incision of about 4 cm 2 QF above the jugulum is made, sharply cutting through the skin, subcutaneous tissue as well as the platysma. The prelaryngeal musculature or infrahyoid musculature is exposed, entered in the midline and the thyroid gland is exposed. Dissection of the trachea between the cricoid cartilage and isthmus. The isthmus is cut and stitched on both sides. No major bleeding. Between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasp, the trachea is entered and a visual tracheotomy is created. The patient is intubated with an 8-gauge cannula. Completion of the procedure without complications. Neck dissection on both sides, neck dissection on the left first: Curved skin incision. Subsequent exposure of the digastric muscle, omohyoid muscle, sternocleidomastoid muscle and infrahyoid muscles. Expose the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein, internal, external and common carotid artery. Expose vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. All structures are preserved, as is the cervical artery. Level I b to 5 are removed, including removal of the submandibular gland with exposure and protection of the marginal mandibular nerve. This results in the removal of levels I b to V. Subsequent careful hemostasis. No evidence of bleeding or lymph flow on final assessment. Subsequent neck dissection on the right side: In principle, this is performed in the same way as on the left side. Exposure of the aforementioned structures and preservation of these. Removal of levels I b to V, but with preservation of the submandibular gland on this side. Subsequent skin closure here in layers with insertion of a Redon drainage. Then elevation of the radial lobe (<CLINICIAN_NAME>, PJ). Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (10x8cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation using silk ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Then removal of split skin with the dermatome set to 8000 turns and 0.8 mm layer. A split-thickness skin graft measuring 10 x 8 cm is harvested from the right thigh. After harvesting the flap from the left forearm, the proximal incision is closed in two layers with Vicryl 3-0, Ethilon 5-0. The lifting defect of the radialis flap is adapted with 2-0 Vicryl and then the split skin is sutured in place. Split skin is stitched and applied to the dressing in the typical manner. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Then PEG (<CLINICIAN_NAME>/<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Entering with the gastroesophagoscope and with air insufflation, pre-scintillation into the stomach. This shows a positive diaphanoscopy, therefore indication for PEG insertion. The needle is now inserted as far as it will go, but the anterior stomach wall is not penetrated. This is carried out at three different, promising sites, here also no penetration of the anterior stomach wall. The PEG was therefore discontinued and a nasogastric tube was inserted in the typical manner. The radialis flap is inserted into the defect in the mouth area: To do this, first widen the tunnel from the floor of the mouth into the soft tissues of the neck. 2 transverse fingers can be pushed through easily. Then pass the pedicle through after inserting the flap into the defect. Successive suturing of the flap into the defect with 3.0 Vicryl single button sutures, this is achieved without tension and completely. Then anastomosis of the flap pedicle. For this purpose, the superior thyroid artery is selected and conditioned. After conditioning the radial artery, suture with 8.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and good venous return. Subsequent conditioning of 2 outlets from the area of the facial vein, this one close to the internal jugular vein. After conditioning of 2 venous outlets from the flap area and 2 outlets from the facial vein area, anastomosis is performed with 2.5 mm couplers. Good venous return in each case after opening the clamps, positive smear phenomenon. Overall flap also well perfused enorally. Vascular pedicle is now placed and partly fixed with sutures to prevent kinking. Subsequent irrigation of the wound area. Careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain and a flap. The procedure is then completed without complications. Patient is transferred to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please monitor flap clinically for 5 days according to schedule, using Doppler monitoring if necessary. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube for approx. 10 days, then if necessary, nutritional support. Overall cT4 cN2c status. Wait for the final histology and presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference to plan further adjuvant therapy.","Partial glossectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Tracheostomy creation

Inspection of the oral cavity. Insertion of the spandex and looping of the tongue. Mobilization of the tongue. There is an exophytic mass on the edge of the tongue on the right side with transition to the base of the tongue and the floor of the mouth with extensions into the anterior floor of the mouth. Mark the edges of the incision with the monopolar needle with a safety margin of 0.5 to 1 cm. The mass is then dissected out all around with scissors and bipolar forceps. It is sent to histology marked with a thread. The pathologist can only detect a very narrow resection margin in two places: the lateral floor of the mouth and the basal floor of the mouth. Both are resected again and another marginal sample is sent for frozen section, so that the tumor is ultimately resected with an R0 situation. The result is a fairly large defect that affects the edge of the tongue and also the floor of the mouth. An extracapsular dissection of an unclear mass on the right parotid gland was then performed. This is also sent for a frozen section. Here the pathologist can identify a Warthin's tumor. Neck dissection performed on the left side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Here the platysma is shown. Dissection of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein, the accessorius nerve and the digastric muscle, the submandibular gland. Clearing of levels I to IV while sparing the plexus branches and the submandibular gland and hypoglossal nerve. Neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the submandibular gland, the digastric muscle, the accessorius nerve, the internal jugular vein, vagus and external/internal carotid artery. Removal of the submandibular gland. Release of the neck preparations I to V while protecting the plexus branches. Blunt dissection towards the floor of the mouth and creation of an opening to the oral cavity. The opening is wide enough to allow 4 transverse fingers to pass through, so the digastric muscle is not cut. The defect is covered with a supraclavicular island flap. Before starting the operation, the transverse cervical artery was identified and marked using the hand-held Doppler. Skin incision over the acromion into the shoulder area. Cutting around the flap, 8 x 5 cm. Lift the flap, taking the fascia of the deltoid muscle with it. Dissection of the pedicle without exposing it, taking subcutaneous fatty tissue with it. Creation of a bridge to the neck. Pulling the pedicle and flap through the bridge and inserting the flap into the mouth area. Incision of the flap in the tongue and floor of the mouth area. Due to the Warthin's tumor in the parotid gland, which also shows other masses, a complete parotidectomy is performed after consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. For this purpose, a facial nerve monitor is placed. Visualization of the main trunk of the facial nerve. Exposure of the first major division. Then dissection along the branches and removal of the entire parotid gland tissue. Then removal of the glandular tissue below the main trunk and between the branches. Finally, insertion of Redon drains and two-layer wound closure. Finally, creation of a tracheostoma. For this, skin incision in the usual manner. Dissection down to the thyroid gland. Dissection of the thyroid gland. Exposure of the trachea. Creation of a visor tracheostomy. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis and insertion of an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube.

A strongly exophytic tumor of the left vocal fold can now be seen, which is limited to the left vocal fold but extends into the anterior commissure. The patient can be positioned relatively well so that there is a good overview of the tumor. Microlaryngoscopic laser ablation of the tumor is now performed. This begins dorsally with a safety margin of around 1-2 mm. In the lateral removal area, it extends deep into the vocalis muscle. The resection is performed anteriorly, where the tumor is dissected from the inner surface of the laryngeal cartilage and removed with the laser. The cartilage surface appears smooth and inconspicuous. The tumor extends a little way into the subglottic area, so that an appropriate safety margin of 2 mm must be maintained on the subglottic slope. Careful hemostasis is then performed. Take representative samples in the area of the anterior commissure as well as at the caudal margin. These are assessed intraoperatively as tumor-free by the pathologist. The lateral cranial and dorsal settling area was macroscopically safe in sano. After repeated careful hemostasis, with dry wound conditions, removal of all instruments. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist.

The above-mentioned operation was therefore indicated. To be on the safe side, the patient was also informed about flap coverage in the event of a very large neck metastasis.","First, oral cavity inspection again. Pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The relatively inconspicuous and flat tumor is seen in the area of the tonsil lobe, which is also somewhat hardened. No growth in the tonsillar lobe. Tumor also well mobile. Indication for surgery therefore given. PEG insertion: insertion of the flexible esophagoscope, after creation of the diaphanoscopy insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Now first insertion of the Mc Ivor blade. The tumor is incised with a safety margin of at least 1 cm on all sides, also in depth. The anterior palatal arch, the tonsil and parts of the base of the tongue and the glossotonsillar groove are removed. The posterior palatal arch remains almost intact. The specimen is removed, thread-marked and sent for frozen section. Tumor-free on all sides in the frozen section. Thus R0 situation with regard to the primary tumor. Careful hemostasis. Now repositioning for neck dissection on both sides and tracheotomy. Beginning with neck dissection on the right: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The mass is located cranially and is relatively difficult to move. Infiltration into the soft tissue is to be expected here. As the dissection progresses, it becomes apparent that the mass is growing up to the lower tonsil pole, which is also resected. Also infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein and parts of the branches of the cervical plexus. First presentation of the omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. The latter must be resected laterally as it is infiltrated. Visualization of the internal jugular vein. It can be visualized caudally, cranially it is clearly infiltrated by the tumor. Depiction of the internal and external carotid artery. The external artery is infiltrated at its outlets. The branches are successively dissected and ligated. The course of the external artery can be preserved up to the parotid gland. The superficial temporal vein is ligated. The facial vein is also ligated. In the area of the bulb and the internal carotid artery, the lymph node conglomerate lies close to these structures. Difficult dissection of the internal carotid artery, which is exposed up to the base of the skull in order to dissect the tumor. However, this is completely successful. No evidence of real infiltration of the wall. Clear tumor infiltration in the area of the hypoglossus, which is also resected. The vagus nerve is also located in the tumor conglomerate and is also thickened. Therefore co-resection. Also resection of the accessorius nerve. Upper parts of the cervical plexus branches must also be partially resected. The phrenic nerve can be preserved, as can the lower parts which extend supraclavicularly. In addition to the large lymph node conglomerate, there are multiple other lymph nodes between the branches of the cervical plexus. A resection up to level Vb and level IIb followed, with complete removal of levels II to V. In the course of the procedure, the caudal parotid pole was resected to confirm a resection in healthy tissue. This also included visualization of the oral branch, which can be preserved. Also marginal samples from the cranial accessorius and vagus area. These marginal samples are healthy. Overall, however, in addition to the large lymph node metastasis conglomerate with clear soft tissue infiltration, multiple metastases level II, III, IV, V. Careful hemostasis, irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain. Due to the extensive metastasis in the neck region on the right, neck dissection on the left is now indicated. Tracheotomy also indicated due to the extensive resection of the important structures on the right side of the neck. Left neck dissection and tracheotomy (<CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME>). Marking of the planned skin incision on the left, curving from mastoid to caudal along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Marking of mandibular angle and mandibular branch. Skin incision using a scalpel through the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Separation of the platysma. Development of a skin flap by successive dissection along the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid anterior margin. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, the accessorius nerve. Exposure and dissection of the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the anterior posterior digastric venter. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the ansa, free preparation of the internal jugular vein and the facial vein as well as other outlets to obtain venous drainage. Development of the medial neck preparation and resection of the same. The superior thyroid artery cannot be spared here; it is ligated and clipped. Now dissect the lateral neck specimen. To do this, expose the common carotid artery and the vagus. Dissection from caudal to cranial, taking level V to Ib. The ansa is visualized as well as the plexus, which is spared. No evidence of hilar fistula. Removal of the neck preparation. Hemostasis, irrigation with H202 and Ringer. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon. Two-layer wound closure. Subsequent tracheotomy. For this purpose, marking of the skin incision 1 QF below the cricoid cartilage, skin incision of approx. 3 cm, dissection through cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue, ligation of larger caliber veins. Exposure of the linea alba and pushing the infrahyoid muscles to the side. Dissection on the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Exposure of the narrow glandular isthmus, which is undermined and extensively bipolarized. Truncus brachiocephalicus is not palpable. Now create a Björk flap between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp, this is successful without any problems. Suturing of the same using a total of 5 stoma sutures. Insertion of an 8 mm cannula and problem-free reintubation. Re-inspection of the right neck, here again bipolar coagulation. Irrigation with H202. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon and two-layer wound closure. Finally, cT1-2 tonsillar carcinoma removed in healthy tissue. Extensive neck metastasis on the right with multiple metastases under a very large metastatic conglomerate. Postoperatively, the patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for one night for monitoring. Please continue antibiotics started intraoperatively. Plan further procedure after receiving the final histology. RCT is most likely indicated.","Transoral tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy

In addition, cervical lymph node metastases on the right cervical side. Thus cT2 N2b hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the right with indication for the above-mentioned measures.","First, induction of anesthesia and transoral endotracheal intubation using a laser tube by the anesthesia colleagues and positioning of the patient by the surgeon. First, the larynx and pharynx were entered using a Kleinsasser C-tube and the findings were inspected. This revealed an exophytic, slightly exulcerated mass originating from the right aryepiglottic fold, affecting the cranial part of the medial wall of the right piriform sinus, clearly infiltrating the anterior wall of the right piriform sinus, but sparing the lateral wall of the piriform sinus as well as the esophageal entrance and the posterior wall of the hypopharynx. Thus V.a. cT2 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the right side. Setting the CO2 laser to a power of 6 watts in continuous mode. Avoidance of the lesion and problem-free resection of the lesion using a piecemeal technique. Hemostasis using monopolar coagulation. Subsequently, 4 marginal samples were taken (right aryepiglottic fold, anterior wall of the piriform sinus, lateral wall of the piriform sinus, caudal area of the medial wall of the piriform sinus). All 4 marginal samples were found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleagues. An R0 resection can therefore be assumed. Repeated inspection. Dry conditions. The patient was then repositioned on the right side for the neck dissection. Skin spray disinfection, application of local anesthesia, skin ablation and sterile draping. First make a skin incision. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure and ligation of the external jugular vein. Creation of a subplatysmal flap in a cranial and caudal direction. Exposure and sparing of the cranial auricular nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, the posterior venter of the digastric muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Dissection along the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial. Dissection along the entire cervical vascular sheath. At least 3 masses were then visualized along the internal jugular vein, which appeared highly suspicious. Successive removal of the posterior neck specimen while sparing the above-mentioned structures and the plexus branches. Removal of the anterior neck preparation and thus evacuation of regions I b, II, III, IV and V. Hemostasis there by means of bipolar coagulation. Irrigation of the wound using hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Dry conditions. Application of a 10 Redon drainage, two-layer wound closure. Subsequent creation of an approx. 4 cm long incision along the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage. Separation of the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure and transection of the prelaryngeal musculature in the midline. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, which is undermined and severed after treatment using bipolar coagulation. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Creation of a transverse incision between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasp. Formation of a Björk flap. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Skin suture and transfer of the patient to a size 8 Rügheimer cannula. Repositioning of the patient to perform a neck dissection on the left side. Skin incision. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure of the auricular nerve. Exposure and ligation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, the posterior venter of the digastric muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, the vagus nerve and the common carotid artery. Dissection along the cervical vascular sheath from caudal to cranial. Successive removal of the posterior neck preparation. Subsequent removal of the anterior neck specimen. There were 2 conspicuous lymph nodes at the level of the upper venous angle. Dry conditions after hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation with hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Placement of a 10 Redon drain, two-layer wound closure. Subsequent re-inspection of the hypopharynx on the right using a Kleinsasser C-tube. Dry conditions there.

The tumor is removed at the dorsal margin immediately in front of the vocalis process of the arytenoid cartilage. Now suture mark the specimen. As the specimen does not show a smooth wound margin at the caudal margin, an additional marginal sample is taken from the subglottal slope. The specimen and this marginal sample are also sent for frozen section diagnostics and are found to be tumor-free during the operation. Subsequent subtle hemostasis. Then, with dry wound conditions, closure of the thyrofissure with single button sutures after prior creation of a total of four drill holes. Then closure of the ligamentum conicum with single button sutures. Closure of the prelaryngeal muscles in the median line after insertion of a wound flap.

There is now an indication for transoral tumor resection. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carry out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesiologist. Induction of anesthesia and transition to rigid tracheoscopy. Setting up the glottis without irritation and passing it with the 0° optics. Entry after endotracheal. Mucosal conditions are unremarkable on all sides up to the exit of the segmental bronchi. The patient is then intubated nasotracheally by the anesthetist. Transition to esophagogastroscopy. Insertion of the endoscope under visualization and constant air insufflation into the stomach. There is no evidence of a synchronous second tumor. Inversion and inspection of the gastroesophageal junction. This appears unremarkable. After desufflation, slow withdrawal of the endoscope with circular inspection of all sections of the esophagus. With the exception of small glycogen acanthoses, there is no evidence of malignancy here either. Removal of the endoscope. Insertion of the mouth guard. Insertion with the size C small bore tube. First, adjust the endolarynx. This appears inconspicuous. Subsequently, meticulous inspection of the hypopharynx on both sides. The piriform sinus is lined on both sides by smooth mucosa on all sides and can be freely unfolded up to the tip. Postcricoid as well as in the area of the esophageal entrance are also unremarkable on all sides. Subsequently, inspection and palpation of the base of the tongue. This is also unremarkable. Inspection of the oral cavity. First insertion of the spandex cheek and lip expander. Insertion of the reinforced mouth guard. Applying the tongue suture. An exophytic tumor measuring approx. 1.5 x 1.5 cm can be seen in the area of the anterior third of the tongue on the right, on the underside. In addition, in the dorsal third of the tongue, just before the glossotonsillar groove on the underside of the tongue, there is a further primary suspicious change in the mucosa. Even after meticulous inspection, this does not appear to be in contact with the first mass. A synchronous second tumor must therefore be assumed. The planned resection margins are now marked. Start with the exophytic tumor in the area of the ventral underside of the tongue. Successive resection of the tumor while maintaining the necessary resection margins using the ultrasound-activated scalpel. The specimen is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Subsequently, the second high-suspect area in the area of the dorsal third of the tongue is also incised on the underside and passes over to the dorsal floor of the mouth. Here too, an invasive procedure must be assumed, which is why meticulous attention is paid to maintaining the necessary safety distances. The second specimen is also thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. Both invasive carcinomas were resected in sano during the frozen section diagnosis by telephone. Only in the area of the dorsally located second carcinoma are there still extensions of a carcinoma in situ at the molar and anterior margin. A resection and corresponding margin samples are now taken. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation. Finally, instillation of a cumulative 7 ml of ropivacaine for postoperative analgesia. Loosening of the suture. Removal of the spandex and the reinforced mouth guard. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Completion of the operation without complications.","Partial glossectomy

The patient has now developed a second carcinoma in the supraglottis area on the left pocket fold with ingrowth into the thyroid cartilage. Prior consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME> that neck dissection would not be performed in the case of a cN0 neck status and condition after neck dissection on both sides.,"After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesiologist, entry with the Kleinsasser tube. Inspection of the hypopharynx and larynx. The tumor described above can be seen in the area of the left pocket fold, moving forward into the anterior commissure and also infiltrating the vocal fold on the left. The piriform sinus, epiglottis and vallecula are tumor-free. A PEG tube is then inserted in the usual way. This can be done without any problems via the old PEG insertion site. Then mark the skin incision and make the incision median to the neck. The laryngeal skeleton can now be prepared directly. The larynx is skeletonized. Exposure of the hyoid bone. Skeletonization of the hyoid bone and removal of the hyoid bone. Then release of the thyroid gland on both sides. Separation of the oblique laryngeal muscles. Dissection of the cervical vascular sheath from the larynx. Exposure of the trachea. Release of the upper thyroid cartilage horn, initially on the right side. Then incision of the periosteum on the thyroid cartilage and removal of the piriform sinus. The same is done on the opposite side. Unfortunately, it cannot be done this far, as the tumor is located on this side. Then expose the pharynx, directly below the base of the tongue at the level of the epiglottis. Pull out the epiglottis and cut around the epiglottis, first on the right side, then on the left side. Release the larynx also in the postcricoid region. Then perform the tracheotomy below the cricoid cartilage and reintubation. Deposition of the laryngeal preparation below the cricoid cartilage. It can be seen that the tumor is relatively close to the resection margin on the lateral pharyngeal wall in the transition to the piriform sinus. To be on the safe side, a large resection is taken and a frozen section is also made of the site, which is ultimately classified by the pathologist as carcinoma in situ and tumor-free. The specimen is sent to the pathologist marked with a thread. Now start with the pharyngeal suture. First at the base of the tongue, then from caudal to cranial, so that the sutures virtually meet in the middle of the pharyngeal defect. Single button sutures are made. Then second single button suture in the usual manner and third pharyngeal suture by beating the thyroid gland and the remaining muscles over it. Insertion of two Redon drains and formation of a tracheostoma through a mucocutaneous anastomosis. Before the pharyngeal suture, a Provox prosthesis was of course inserted in the usual manner, size 8, with the trocar approx. 1 cm below the stoma. Two-layer wound closure. The operation was completed without complications. Please continue antibiotic treatment and X-ray swallow on the 10th postoperative day.

Occasional bipolar coagulation of minor bleeding in the area of the lateral tonsil bed on both sides. If the wound bed is dry, the patient is repositioned for neck dissection. First, skin spray disinfection and infiltration anesthesia. Abjode the surgical site and cover it sterilely. Marking of the mandibular arch and the ascending mandibular branch. Marking of the planned incision. Sharp cutting of the cutis and subcutis. Expose the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Overall, there is pronounced metastasis, especially in levels II and III. The posterior digastric venter muscle cannot be visualized initially due to the extensive metastatic conglomerate. Therefore turn to visualization of the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, the venous angle and the common carotid artery, the bifurcation and the internal/external carotid artery. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and successive detachment of the metastatic conglomerate from the digastric muscle. Relocation and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessorius nerve in the sense of neurolysis. In level II b, the metastases extend far to the cranial side. Successive development of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the accessory nerve and the plexus branches. Clearing of levels II b, II a, III, IV as well as V. Level IV also shows a clearly enlarged lymph node, which however could also be reactively altered by the previous operation. Then turn to the medial neck preparation. Successive detachment of a large metastasis located in the venous angle. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and protection of the same. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve in the sense of neurolysis. Here too, the metastasis extends far to the cranial side. However, the oral branch can be stimulated in depth with the help of stimulation. Ultimately, the medial neck preparation can also be completely developed. At the end of the operation, the wound was dry on all sides. Levels I b, II a, II b, III, IV and V were evacuated. The wound cavity was rinsed with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10 Redon drain. Subcutaneous suturing with Vicryl 4.0 and skin suturing with Ethilon 5.0. Application of a wound and pressure dressing. Completion of the operation without complications. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist. The patient received 3 g Unacid intraoperatively as a single shot antibiotic.

The PET-CT showed increased FTG storage in the area of the left tonsil, so a panendoscopy with left tonsillectomy and, if necessary, CUP panendoscopy was indicated. A detailed preoperative discussion was held with the patient and his <CLINICIAN_NAME> about the planned procedure and there was ample opportunity to ask questions.","First induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. Then rigid tracheoscopy with the O° scope by the surgeon. The trachea is free and non-irritated up to the carina with inconspicuous mucosa. Intubation by the anesthesia colleagues and then insertion of the Mc Ivor mouth blocker. Palpation of the tonsilloliths on both sides. Small palatine tonsils can be seen on both sides, with the left tonsil in the upper pole being slightly indurated in comparison to the sides. Demonstration of the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME> and determination of the procedure. Tonsillectomy on the left should be performed first, followed by a frozen section. Subsequently, panendoscopy and nasopharyngeal curettage and removal of tongue base biopsies with clinically largely unremarkable left tonsil. Approach for left tonsillectomy: Exposure of the upper pole of the tonsil. The tonsil is successively and completely removed with bipolar and scissors. The posterior palatal arch is left completely intact. Laterally, the tonsil is released quite generously and caudally it is separated with the bipolar and scissors. The suture markings are made cranially and laterally. At the transition to the base of the tongue in the glossotonsillar groove, individual lymph follicles are still visible, which cannot be clearly assigned to the tonsil; these are resected separately with bipolar and scissors and submitted as histology glossotonsillar groove for frozen section assessment. There is no relevant bleeding after the tonsillectomy. Removal of the oral retractor and insertion of the flexible esophagogastroscope into the stomach in the typical manner. The gastric mucosa is completely free of irritation up to the pylorus and with inversion in the area of the cardia. Then carefully withdraw the esophagoscope with constant air insufflation. From 40 to 43 cm tooth row there are isolated erosions and at 42 cm from the tooth row a spherical exophytic, but overall smoothly limited mass. Demonstration of the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who recommends taking a forceps biopsy. Now advance the forceps over the working channel and take 3 representative samples from the exophytic mass. Finally, there is no relevant bleeding. Further retraction of the esophagoscope. Further cranial than 40 cm from the tooth row, the mucosa is completely normal and smooth. Now insert a mouth guard and inspect the rest of the oropharynx. The posterior and lateral walls of the oropharynx are free, as are the valleculae, the base of the tongue, which is symmetrically slightly hyperplastic, the lateral walls of the hypopharynx, the posterior wall of the hypopharynx and both piriform sinuses are free and can be freely unfolded. The esophageal inlet can also be freely unfolded with inconspicuous mucosal conditions. Direct laryngoscopy reveals an inconspicuous posterior and anterior commissure, the interary area is clear, as are the folds of the pouch, the morgue sinus and the vocal folds. The Mc Ivor mouth retractor is now inserted again and a velotractio is inserted on both sides. In the nasopharynx, slightly left-accentuated minor adenoids are seen, which are curetted out with the Beckmann ring knife under vision and sent for final histology. Finally, hemostasis with the bipolar. Removal of the mouth guard and insertion of the mouth guard and insertion of the Kleinsasser B-tube for re-inspection of the base of the tongue. There are no abnormalities here. Decision to take 2 representative samples each from the middle of the tongue base and the right and left sides. Final hemostasis with the monopolar. The frozen section result of <CLINICIAN_NAME> is now transmitted. It shows a basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil, which was resected practically on all sides R1. Discussion of the findings with <CLINICIAN_NAME> and acceptance of the operation by <CLINICIAN_NAME> for resection. This is done using the monopolar knife, bipolar and scissors. The resected specimen and representative marginal samples are submitted for final histology. The gl. submandibularis is now exposed laterocaudally. Final hemostasis with the bipolar. Removal of the swabs from the nasopharynx and, after re-inspection of the tonsil larynx and nasopharynx, termination of the operation with absolute hemostasis. Conclusion: V.a. cT2 cN1 basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil. After receipt of the final histology, neck dissection of the left side and PEG placement must definitely be planned with regard to an upcoming adjuvant radiochemotherapy. Please also note the histology from the esophageal mass 42 cm from the ZR. Depending on the final R status and swallowing function, a further resection and/or radial flap coverage must also be considered. According to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, flap coverage is required in the case of an R1 situation towards the palatal arch, medially and laterally. If there is an R1 situation towards the base of the tongue, another transoral resection could be performed.","Tumor-tonsillectomy, Panendoscopy, PE's

The tonsils can be palpated on the right side. There is a hard tumor submucosally. Tumor resection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who first begins the resection with the electric needle right next to the uvula on the anterior palatal arch. Part of the anterior palatal arch is removed. Then transition to the lateral pharyngeal wall and dissection of the tonsil, including a small muscular cuff. The base of the tongue itself is free and does not need to be resected. A portion of the posterior palatal arch can be left. The preparation is thread-marked for the frozen section. In the area of the anterior palatal arch, a marginal sample is taken directly after the tumor resection, which is also thread-marked and sent for histology. The pathologists still found tumor cells in the basal area, so a generous resection is performed in the area of the anterior palatal arch, the lateral pharyngeal wall and the basal tonsillar lobe area. No further resection is possible here, as small areas of fat from the neck are already visible. However, the resected area is tumor-free. Then neck dissection on the left side. Skin incision in the usual manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the accessory muscle, then the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Evacuation of levels II, III and IV. Intraoperatively, the decision is made to also evacuate level V, as there are some visible lymph nodes here. Neck dissection on the right side. After discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the decision was made to perform a neck dissection on the right side. However, to proceed very carefully in the area of the submandibular gland so as not to produce a fistula. Skin incision in the usual manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle anterior margin, exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Then explore the submandibular gland, proceeding with extreme caution so that the gland is not completely dislocated. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Very careful dissection here too. Free dissection of the internal jugular vein. Level II shows a soft, cystic mass, which initially does not look metastatic; from the macroscopic aspect it could be a cystadenolymphoma of the parotid gland or a lymphangioma, which is demonstrated intraoperatively to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. He recommends removing this mass anyway. To do this, the skin incision is widened slightly and the mass is removed completely. Then clearing out level IIa to Va while sparing the accessorius nerve and the plexus branches. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, which can also be preserved. Then perform a tracheotomy. Skin incision in the usual manner. Dissection down to the musculature. Push the muscles to the side in the midline. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, which is very small and can be coagulated and transected in a bipolar fashion. Exposure of the trachea. Entering the trachea between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis and insertion of a size 8 tracheal cannula. Continue antibiotics postoperatively. No oral food on the day of surgery. On the next day, please demonstrate to the surgeon; fluids can probably already be started. Otherwise, present the patient to the tumor conference.","Tumor resection, Functional neck dissection, Tracheotomy

After positioning the larynx with the Weerda laryngoscope, the epiglottis is first cut at the transition from the lateral to the medial third and followed into the vallecula at an appropriate safety distance from the tumor. The tumor is then removed caudally and medially from the upper edge of the arytenoid cartilage, which is exposed in its upper third. The tumor is then resected dorsally along the supraglottis. Resection then begins from the lateral hypopharyngeal wall with an appropriate safety distance to the tumor. The resection is then continued cranially in the direction of the vallecula and joined with the incision from the base of the epiglottis. Finally, the tumor is also completely removed caudally, leaving out the tip of the piriform sinus. The specimen is then thread-marked and mounted on cork and sent to the pathology department for frozen section histology. Here, all marginal incisions as well as the one incision from the base of the tumor are found to be tumor-free. Finally, careful hemostasis by monopolar coagulation in the resection area. This involved clipping a small arterial branch in the lateral pharyngeal wall. Now insertion of a gastric tube under visualization, the correct position of which is also checked and confirmed by auscultation. Then transition to neck dissection on the right side. After a skin incision in the area of the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, regions II to V are successively removed. All non-lymphatic structures are spared and remain intact. Once the neck dissection preparation has been removed, careful hemostasis is performed. Insertion of a Redon suction drain. Two-layer wound closure. Subsequent transition to the left side. Similar procedure here. Here too, regions II to V are successively evacuated while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. There is no indication of a lymph node metastasis. Insertion of a Redon suction drain and subsequent wound closure. The surgical site was then checked. This revealed the now quite large resection area on the left side. The decision was therefore made to perform a protective tracheostomy. A transverse skin incision about 3 cm long was made and the linea alba was dissected. Dissection of the straight neck muscles with exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed under the pretracheal lamina, clamped and stitched around. This exposes the upper trachea. Entrance between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp in the sense of a visual tracheostomy. Placement of 2 upper and 2 lower sutures for the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequently, the patient was reintubated onto an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube without any problems. Sterile wound dressing. Transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Transoral laser-surgical partial laryngeal/pharyngeal resection for a carcinoma of the aryepiglottic fold. Selective neck dissection of regions II to V on both sides. Insertion of a plastic tracheostoma and a transnasal feeding tube.","Larynx-pharynx partial resection, Selective neck dissection bilateral Level II - V, Tracheostomy, Nasogastric feeding tube

Carry out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Induction of anesthesia and intubation of the patient. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon. Skin spray disinfection and infiltration anesthesia. Skin wipe disinfection and sterile draping. First mark the planned incision after palpatory identification of the thyroid incisura and the upper edge of the cricoid cartilage. Make the incision using the broken-line technique. Sharp cutting of the cutis as well as the subcutis. Expose the prelaryngeal musculature. Locate the median line. Lateralization of the prelaryngeal musculature and exposure of the thyroid cartilage.

A tumor can now be seen extending from the right vocal process via the anterior commissure to the middle third of the left vocal fold. Initially beginning on the right side. First infiltration anesthesia glottic right. Then resection of the right vocal fold, including the vocal ligament, the vocalis muscle and parts of the thyroarytenoid muscle. In some cases, it is necessary to resect down to the perichondrium of the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage. The same procedure is also carried out on the left side. Here the resection only extends to the posterior third, taking the middle third with it. Here too, the extent of the resection is carried out via the vocal ligament and the vocalis muscle to the arytaenoid muscle. In the ventral part of the resection area, resection is also performed down to the inner perichondrium leaf of the thyroid cartilage. This is followed by hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Removal of circular margin samples. Right: upper front, upper back, lower back, lower front; left: upper front, upper back, lower back, lower front. During the telephone frozen section examination, extensions of a squamous cell carcinoma in situ can still be seen subglottically on the right. Therefore, a definitive resection and a new marginal sample are taken and also sent for frozen section diagnostics. This is found to be tumor-free intraoperatively. Therefore, proceed to closure of the larynx. Creation of a total of 4 drill holes. Insertion of a 14 mm laryngeal wedge. Suturing with Vicryl 4.0. Creation of 2 additional drill holes to achieve adequate closure of the laryngeal skeleton. Closure of the incision in the area of the ligamentum conicum. Mobilization of the two perichondrium flaps. These are folded over the Keel and sutured in the median line. Overall very good aspect. Insertion of a sterile flap. Re-adaptation of the prelaryngeal musculature.

It can be seen that the tumor reaches right up to the anterior commissure, but does not appear to exceed it. The anterior commissure has thus been opened beyond the tumor. Nevertheless, a marginal sample was taken from the left anterior commissure. Subsequent re-inspection of the tumor. This is easily displaceable in relation to the thyroid cartilage. Therefore, the tumor, which reaches the vocal process here and can be removed there, was cut around. In the upper area, the tumor does not reach the pocket fold. Only slight infiltration of the subglottic slope towards the lower margin. The tumor is macroscopically resected in sano on all sides.

Mirror findings revealed an exophytic mass in the area of the right glottis with transition to the supraglottis. The vocal fold mobility on the right side is clearly immobile to fixed. Sampling during panendoscopy <2016> revealed a G2 squamous cell carcinoma with CT-morphologically questionable infiltration of the right arytenoid cartilage. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.,"First, induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the tumor. The tumor completely infiltrates the right vocal fold, passes into the anterior commissure and infiltrates two thirds of the left vocal fold, it grows supraglottically and infiltrates the entire pocket fold on the right side and two thirds of the pocket fold on the left side. The mucosa at the vocal process is also infiltrated. Mechanically, the ary on the right side is still mobile with the small double spoon, but less mobile than on the left side. Demonstration of the findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. It is decided to first resect the mucosa in the area of the posterior artery and send it for a frozen section. This is also done. The patient also has a rather benign cyst postcricoid on the right side. This cyst is also removed with the scissors and sent for frozen section. The frozen section showed no evidence of carcinoma in either specimen, so the decision was made to continue with the laser resection and to forgo a complete laryngectomy for the time being. Now loosening and removal of the tumor on the posterior surface, then repositioning and removal of the tumor in the area of the anterior commissure. This is relatively difficult as the patient cannot be adjusted well at the anterior commissure. Finally, the tumor is successfully released there. It must be completely lasered off the thyroid cartilage. Infiltration of the thyroid cartilage is not present on CT morphology or clinically. Then first resection of the tumor portion on the left side. Here, half of the pocket fold on the vocal fold falls. It is clear that the tumor is also growing approximately 0.5 cm into the subglottic appendix on both the right and left sides. Here, too, resection is necessary. Finally, the tumor is also resected on the right side, including the pocket fold and the subglottic slope for 0.5 cm. The arytenoid cartilage can be preserved, but the mucosa in the area of the vocal process must be completely resected. The specimen is placed on cork for final histology. Subsequently, marginal samples are taken subglottically on both sides as well as centrally, then in the area of both pocket folds and the posterior margins. All marginal samples are R0 in the frozen section. The entire surface of the tumor is covered by the margin samples and an R0 resection can be assumed. Then repositioning for neck dissection on the right side. For this, the skin incision is made relatively caudally in a skin fold that extends up to the mastoid. It is theoretically possible to extend this skin incision to the apron flap in a second operation if a functional laryngectomy should become necessary. Now the platysma is shown. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Then release of the neck preparation level II a to IV while sparing the plexus branches. Tearing of the internal jugular vein occurs in level II, which is sutured over with Vascufil 6.0. Then consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The latter was cautious about the overall indication for neck dissection in this procedure, so the neck dissection on the left side was not performed. Repositioning for tracheotomy. Perform the tracheotomy in the usual manner with formation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis in the sense of a visor tracheotomy. Then transfer intubation to a tracheostomy tube 8.0. Then insertion of a nasogastric tube. Please present the patient at the tumor conference after receiving the final histology, to plan any adjuvant therapy. No oral food for 5 days, then attempt to swallow and build up diet, if necessary speech therapy swallowing training. As he was able to remain standing on the right side and on the left side, swallowing should not cause any problems in the long term, if no adjuvant therapy is necessary, please have a control MLE in 10 to 12 weeks. If there is clear granulation tissue, then remove the granulation tissue and possibly insert a Dacron foil or PDS foil secondarily.  ","Laser resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy

Preoperative MRI and PET-CT image diagnostics indicated a CUP syndrome with a large metastasis in the caudal parotid region. A gross needle puncture was performed in domo 4 weeks ago in LA. A metastasis at the lower parotid pole was biopsied and a squamous cell carcinoma was confirmed. Now, due to a small ulcer on the left edge of the tongue, a primary tumor in the oral cavity is suspected. Therefore indication for intraoperative panendoscopy and frozen section biopsy of the suspected ulcer as well as the procedure described above.","Anesthesia is first induced by the anesthesia colleague. A rigid tracheobronchoscopy is then performed by the 1st surgeon. There is no evidence of a secondary tumor in the area of the glottis, subglottis and trachea up to the entrance of the main bronchi. Intubation by the surgeon and head positioning. Next, a flexible gastroscopy is performed. The flexible gastroscope is advanced into the stomach under constant air insufflation. Inspection of the stomach reveals non-irritable mucosal conditions with a very pronounced small gastric curvature. After inspection of all areas of the stomach, the esophagus is thoroughly examined from caudal to cranial with the flexible gastroscope. Linea serrata inconspicuous at 42 cm from the upper alveolar ridge. The caudal middle and cranial part of the esophagus is completely clinically unremarkable. Removal of the flexible gastroscope and insertion of the size B small bore tube. The oral cavity and oropharynx are inspected. In the area of the glossotonsillar groove on the left edge of the tongue, a small ulcer of at least 1-1.5 cm in diameter is seen, which is relatively coarse on palpation and grows into the tongue muscles. Other areas of the oropharynx such as the base of the tongue, vallecula, both tonsils, posterior pharyngeal wall and lateral pharyngeal wall are completely unremarkable. A biopsy is then taken from the ulcers described above and the tissue is sent for frozen section examination. A direct pharyngoscopy and inspection of the supraglottis using a size C Kleinsasser tube is also performed. The hypopharynx (piriform sinus on both sides and retrocricodal area) and supraglottis showed normal anatomical conditions with no evidence of a secondary malignancy. Removal of the size C small siphon tube without injury to the oral structures. After waiting for the frozen section diagnosis, a histology in the sense of a squamous cell carcinoma is confirmed. Next, a PEG is placed with classic sutures. The next step is to resect the tumor on the left edge of the tongue. Here, a distance of 1 to 1.2 cm from the ulcer is made clinically as well as a relatively deep excision in the tongue musculature. The specimen is then thread-marked. In addition, a sample is taken from the tumor bed; a strip is cut from the tongue musculature and sent separately for histological analysis. Careful hemostasis using bipolar forceps. No evidence of injury to the great vessels in the sense of the lingual artery. The patient is then repositioned for neck dissection and left parotidectomy. Skin disinfection. Application of 4 electrodes for monitoring the facial nerve. Infiltration of the subcutis using 10 ml mixed solution of Suprarenin and Ultracaine. Sterile washing and covering. Insertion of a skin incision from the jugulum to the mastoid on the left. Dissection in depth and sharp cutting of the subcutis and platysma. At the cranial edge of the incision, a portion of the skin above the parotid gland, where a coarse needle biopsy was performed, is included in the preparation. Next, lift off the subplatysmal flap anteriorly and cranially as well as laterally and posteriorly. Identification of the external jugular vein and auricular nerve. Both structures enter the mass cranially so that both structures are ligated and separated approx. 5 cm from the caudal metastasis. Then identify the superficial cervical fascia and further dissect from lateral to medial. Dissection is then carried out in the level IV area, where a complete clearing of level IV is performed. During the dissection, the artery and transverse vein of the neck are exposed and spared, but a branch of the thoracic duct is exposed and injured. Intraoperatively, intrathoracic pressure is then increased and the open vessel is found and then additionally ligated. Further control with artificial Valsalva shows no evidence of lymphorrhea. Then successive dissection from caudal to cranial with sparing of the cervical plexus. Further dissection from caudal to cranial until the large metastasis is identified in level IIa, IIb and the cranial part of level V. This metastasis is at least 6 cm in diameter and is obviously growing into the sternocleidomastoid muscle and internal jugular vein as well as the caudal parotid region. After clearing level III, level I is then cleared successively from caudal and anterior to cranial and posterior, sparing the submandibular gland. Cranially, the ramus marginalis mandibulae is exposed and completely spared. Dissection practically up to the caudal area level IIa, here complete adhesion of the internal jugular vein as well as the accessorius nerve and sternocleidomastoid muscle can be seen. Next, a partial parotidectomy is performed under facial nerve monitoring from cranial and anterior to posterior and caudal. A distance of at least 1-2 cm is maintained from the large parotid metastasis. After dissection at the anterior parotid margin, the ramus marginalis mandibulae and a pronounced buccal branch are visualized. These are now followed in a retrograde course under constant facial stimulation. Successive dissection from the periphery to the center until the cervicofacial ramus and then the facial nerve are identified. The facial nerve and its branches, although relatively close to the mass, are not fused with the mass. The main cords of the facial nerve are carefully and completely exposed here and completely spared and shifted cranially. Here there is clear adhesion of the metastasis at the base of the sternocleidocleidomastoid muscle and level V between the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. Here, sharp dissection up to the tip of the mastoid and complete separation of the insertion from the mastoid. Further dissection deep into level Va until the prevertebral muscles (splenius and levator scapulae muscles) are identified. Here further dissection caudally and anteriorly until identification of the R. and N. accessorius at the posterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Careful inspection of level II and affected structures. Decision to perform a radical neck resection, as the metastasis is clearly growing on the above-mentioned structures. Next, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is sharply separated at the transition from the cranial to the middle 1/3. Careful coagulation at the edge of the detachment. The accessorius nerve is ligated and sharply separated. The internal jugular vein is then ligated and sutured twice and then sharply separated. Dissection along the common carotid artery and external and internal carotid artery in a cranial direction. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve and symptomatic trunk in the carotid space. Branches of the cervical plexus in the area of level II are also sharply dissected. Now dissect further anteriorly and include the facial vein and the posterior edge of the masseter muscle at the posterior edge of the mandible. Dissection deep into the masseteric space, here the metastasis grows together practically up to the base of the skull. Further sharp separation of the metastasis from the external and internal carotid artery along the cervical vascular sheath. Now demonstration on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and takeover of the operation. The metastasis is now first dissected sharply at the base of the skull along the internal and external carotid artery. In the further course, clear adhesion of the metastasis to the external carotid artery and questionable infiltration of the hypoglossal nerve and internal carotid artery. Successive separation of the remainder of the metastasis at the base of the skull above the atlas and lateral to the styloid process. Due to severe bleeding in the area of the stylomastoid foramen, the main trunk of the facial nerve is coagulated but not severed. Here, stimulation of the main branch results in a complete nerve block approx. 0.5 cm from the stylomastoid foramen. The main branch of the facial nerve can be completely stimulated with 0.5 mA from this nerve block. Decision to ligate the external carotid artery and resection of the hypoglossal nerve and internal carotid artery to the base of the skull. Neck dissection together with the parotid leaf is sent in one piece for histological analysis, level Ia and level IV are marked separately with the suture for orientation. Next, dissection along the external carotid artery. This is ligated twice caudally after the exit of the superior thyroid vein and then punctured and sharply separated. The third branch of the lingual artery is also ligated twice and then sharply separated. The third branch of the external carotid artery, facial artery, is also ligated twice and sharply separated. The remainder of the external carotid artery is then traced together with the hypoglossal nerve and sharply separated from the carotid fascia and from the vagus nerve and internal carotid artery. This preparation is sent separately for histological analysis. A large defect remains at the base of the skull from the jugular fossa over the petrous bone to the carotid foramen. The wound is then thoroughly irrigated and careful hemostasis with ligation and bipolar electrocoagulation. The remainder of the sternocleidomatoid muscle is sutured to the platysma to reconstruct the neck contour. Two size 10 Redon drains are inserted caudally. The facial nerve trunk is carefully covered with Tabotamp. Careful wound closure. Redon drainage is inspected again, it works perfectly. The defect on the left edge of the tongue is now inspected. Relatively dry conditions here. Due to R0 frozen section diagnostics, a decision is made to close the wound primarily. Careful primary closure and plastic reconstruction of the defect at the edge of the tongue on the left is performed. If the swelling at the uvula and base of the tongue is relatively mild, the decision is made to transfer the patient to the IOI for overnight monitoring. The patient is then handed over to the anesthesiologist. End of the surgical procedure. Conclusion: Complication-free performance of a rapid incision-controlled resection of the tongue margin carcinoma on the left, extended radical neck dissection from level I to level V on the left and partial parotidectomy with intraoperative facial nerve monitoring and PEG placement. Panendoscopy revealed a left tongue ulcer, so that a diagnosis was confirmed via frozen section. Intraoperative a metastasis growing from the caudal parotid pole to the skull base and levels IIa, IIb and V. Difficult conditions in the area of the skull base due to adhesions to the external carotid artery and questionable adhesions to the internal carotid artery. Overall an unsafe resection in the area of the internal carotid artery and skull base. An R1 situation is possible here. The accessorius nerve, internal jugular vein, cranial edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, hypoglossal nerve, external carotid artery and cranial part of the cervical plexus and cranial part of the sympathetic plexus are sacrificed intraoperatively. Postoperative radiotherapy should always be carried out if infiltration of the internal carotid artery is questionable. Rapid and aggressive rehabilitation due to shoulder function as well as speech and swallowing due to hypoglossal sacrifice and sacrifice of the accessory nerve. Cortisone therapy tapered off for the next 7 days due to injury to the main facial nerve trunk. The facial nerve should be given at least 6-12 months to recover. Redon ex please after progression. Further procedure and presentation of the patient to the tumor board after receipt of the final histology. One night of monitoring for IOI due to slight swelling at the base of the tongue and uvula.","SS-controlled resection of tongue edge, Neck dissection, Parotid, PEG, Panendoscopy

For this reason, the indication for the above procedure was given.","Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Positioning of the patient. Abjoration of the skin, injection of local anesthetic without adrenaline. Ellipsoidal vertical skin incision prelaryngeal with resection of the old tracheotomy scar. Layered preparation in depth. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. This is cut in the midline and dissected to the side. Exposure of the laryngeal skeleton. Further exposure of the ligamentum conicum. This is incised after saturation of the patient and the incision is extended laterally. Dissect the perichondrium from the laryngeal cartilage. This is opened in the median line with the wheel. Insertion of the retractor. Opening of the epithelium endolaryngeally. The tumor described above can be seen on the left side. A marginal sample is taken in the area of the anterior commissure. The tumor does not appear to cross the midline here. Dissection from ventral to the thyroid cartilage. Strict dissection of the thyroid cartilage. The tumor extends slightly subglottically and infiltrates the cranial pocket fold. Dorsally, the tumor extends to the arytenoid cartilage. The patient should therefore be intubated via the laryngofissure. The endolaryngeal tube is thread-armed and remains cranially in the area of the supraglottis. The resection is initially performed at the caudal edge of the sedimentation, slightly subglottic, from ventral to dorsal. Furthermore, resection of the tumor in the cranial deposition area with removal of the caudal part of the pouch ligament on the left side. In the dorsal area, the arytenoid cartilage is largely skeletonized and the resection is completed by removing the vocal process. The tumor specimen is sent for definitive histopathological assessment. Further frozen sections are taken from the caudal and cranial margins of the arytenoid process. Furthermore, removal of a marginal sample from the cranial edge of the deposit in the area of the pocket crease. Removal of marginal samples from the wound bed and removal of a subglottic marginal sample from the caudal margin. All marginal samples are sent for frozen section diagnostics and are diagnosed as tumor-free by the pathologist. Careful hemostasis is then performed. Suturing of a laryngeal wedge and closure of the laryngofissure after making a total of four drill holes. Suturing of the ligamentum conicum. Mobilization of soft tissue, which is closed prelaryngeally with single button sutures. Insertion of a wound flap. Repeated dissection of prelaryngeal fatty tissue. This is also sutured using single button sutures. Two-layer skin closure. Application of a pressure bandage. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Completion of the procedure.

The tracheostomy is then performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. A small tracheostoma is created and the patient is then easily intubated. Subsequently, transition to tumor resection transorally through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. After insertion of the mouth retractors, the tongue is first sutured to the tip of the tongue on the right and luxated outwards. The tumor located on the left edge of the tongue and the adjacent floor of the mouth can now be seen. On palpation, it extends to the midline in the posterior third of the tongue. The resection is then performed with the ultrasonic knife at an appropriate distance from the tumor, which is not easily palpable in the body of the tongue, especially in the dorsal area. The tumor is then gradually developed, whereby the resection also includes the adjacent floor of the mouth up to just before the ascending mandibular branch. Medially, the midline of the tongue is partially crossed in order to obtain a sufficient palpatory safety margin. In the dorsal direction, the resection can be moved laterally again at the beginning of the base of the tongue. The left half of the tongue is then completely resected. During the final inspection of the resection specimen, a suspicious area can be seen macroscopically on the underside, as the base of the tumor. This is test excised. Here, the frozen section diagnosis still reveals parts of the squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore, another extensive resection is performed in the area of the tumor base, so that the lingual artery on the opposite side is also left intact by the resection, but must be visualized. In this resection, there is no more tumor in the frozen section histology, so that an R0 resection can be assumed. The defect measures 11 x 6 cm. The radial lobe of <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> is also elevated at this size. Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (6 x 11 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Defect coverage of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. In the meantime, selective neck dissection of regions I to V is performed on both sides. On the left side, the facial artery is dissected up to the mandible and the digastric muscle is severed. After appropriate lifting of the radial lobe graft, it is inserted into the defect via the submandibular lobe and sutured in place. The arterial anastomosis is performed at the confluence of the lingual artery and the facial artery, as only here is there sufficient caliber for anastomosis with the radial artery, which has a large caliber. After performing the arterial anastomosis, the venous anastomosis is performed with the 2 arm veins in an end-to-side manner to the internal jugular vein. Finally, multi-layer wound closure after insertion of a Redon suction drain and a drainage flap on the left side. Finally, the patient was reintubated onto an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube without any problems. The flap is vital at the end of the operation. End of the operation and transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Transoral resection of a tongue carcinoma on the left side in the sense of an extensive left-sided hemiglossectomy. Selective neck dissection of regions I to V on both sides, defect coverage with a microvascularly anastomosed radial flap graft from the left forearm with coverage by split skin from the right thigh, insertion of a PEG tube and a temporary tracheostomy.","Tumor resection in the context of hemiglossectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Radial flap, Tracheostomy, PEG placement

Clear HPV association of the tumor. On CT cystic metastasis with extension into the tonsillar lobes on the right side. Overall cT2 cN2b cM0 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, an inspection of the primary tumor region is performed: Here, the primary tumor is submucosal in the area of the right tonsil lobe, circumscribed and extending into the soft palate, with moderate displacement towards the soft tissues of the neck. The submucosal tumor growth ends in the caudal area of the tonsil. Right cervical subcutaneously grown and clearly inflamed lymph node metastasis with subsequent puncture and open site. Due to the extent of the metastasis, PEG insertion was initially carried out: For this purpose, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy to advance into the stomach. With good diaphanoscopy, easy puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. Subsequent transoral tumor resection: This is performed as an extended radical tumor tonsillectomy. Complete removal of the anterior floor of the mouth. Resection up to the alveolar ridge. Circumscribed here, with removal of the alveolar ridge mucosa, resection and removal of the posterior palatal arch. The muscles of the posterior palatal arch are also resected extensively if they are adherent. A muscle cuff can also be left on the tumor laterally. However, the tumor extends into the soft tissues of the neck. Overall, complete tumor removal transorally. The specimen also shows an in sano resection, so that the specimen is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. All mucosal margins as well as the basal margins are free of tumor and dysplasia, so that an R0 situation can be assumed here. Turning to the neck dissection of the right side: Here, the perforated skin area is cut around in a spindle shape. Release of the skin. Subcutaneous, extensive inflammatory surrounding of the metastasis is also seen later, so that the skin resection must be extended here, with no clear distinction between tumor and inflammatory events. Widen the skin incision caudally. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle cranially on the mastoid and caudally. Widespread infiltration of the muscle. It is therefore cut at its insertion and origins. Visualization of the omohyoid muscle. Clearly inflammatory scarring in the direction of the submandibular gland. However, this is not infiltrated. Release of the capsule. Exposure of the digastric muscle. This is also resected if adherent to the metastasis. Infiltration and consumption of the accessorius nerve. This is not exposed. The internal jugular vein, vagus nerve and common carotid artery are visualized caudally. At the level of the metastatic conglomerate, the vein is infiltrated and thrombosed cranially. For this reason, the vein is removed caudally. Preservation of the common carotid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Separation of the occipital and facial arteries. Partial resection of the cervical plexus. No further metastasis in the direction of level Vb. Overall, however, complete resection of the right cervical draining veins due to the extent of the tumor. Resection of the metastatic conglomerate and the attached neck preparation in toto. After removal, there is now a defect measuring approx. 3 cm to the primary tumor region. Therefore, blunt opening is performed here with a clear indication for defect reconstruction due to the pharyngocutaneous fistula. Due to the resected superficial and deep veins on the right side, there is no possibility of a microvascular connection here. Therefore, the indication is for defect coverage using a pedicled supraclavicular island flap. If there is good skin mobility here, the defect is measured. An area measuring 8x5 cm is then incised in a spindle shape. Resection down to the muscle fascia. Removal of the muscle fascia. Release of the tissue at the acromion and isolation of the supplying vascular area from the transversa colli artery, which could already be identified by Doppler sonography before lifting the flap. Release on all sides of the trapezius muscle at the clavicle, so that a well mobile pedicle can be developed overall, with completely tension-free insertion into the oral cavity. Prior to this, the skin incision was widened and the skin dissected. Insertion of the flap into the oral cavity and successive suturing. Subsequently, tight conditions on all sides with a vital flap and overall sufficient reconstruction. The wound is then irrigated on the right cervical side. If the wound is dry, insertion of two 10-gauge Redon drains. Careful two-layer wound closure. Neck dissection of the left side was performed at the same time as defect reconstruction: skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Clearing of levels II to Va and preservation of the facial vein, superior thyroid artery, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve and cervical plexus branches. Exposure and preservation of the vagus nerve and common carotid artery. Overall, no macroscopically highly visible nodes. Subsequent wound irrigation and inspection. If the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Careful two-layer wound closure. Due to the extent of the procedure, a final protective tracheotomy is performed: incision at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Skin incision. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea, after separation of the infrahyoid muscles. Exposure and transection of the thyroid isthmus. Entering the trachea. Widening by performing a visor tracheostomy and then successive incision of the tracheostoma. Subsequent easy transfer to a size 8 low-cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. Subsequent enoral inspection and, if the graft was vital, completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g. Please continue this for 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT2 cN2b-cN3 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Please feed via the PEG tube for 7 days. Subsequently, with regular enoral healing and flap perfusion, gradual diet build-up. This should be functionally possible. Subsequently, prompt recanalization should be possible.

Starting from the supraglottic side, the left vocal fold is first completely incised, also towards the subglottic side and partially released. The thyroid cartilage is then also cut through on the right, so that a V-shaped section of thyroid cartilage remains on the complete resection. Here too, the soft tissue is pushed away from the inner wall of the thyroid cartilage. The tumor is then cut around successively, starting from the supraglottic area; the left tumor was only in the area of the left vocal fold, approximately up to the middle third. On the right side, the vocal fold tumor on the vocal fold extends to just before the vocal process; it also extends slightly into the morgue sinus and is completely cut around here.

A PET-CT was then performed. The right base of the tongue as well as the mass on the right side of the neck were illuminated. The above-mentioned procedure was therefore performed.,"Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department to release the patient. Induction of anesthesia. Performance of tracheoscopy: inconspicuous conditions in the endolarynx up to the bifurcation. Careful inspection of the larynx with microlaryngoendoscopy as well as the hypopharynx and base of the tongue: An ulcerated area is then found here. This is biopsied and found to be a carcinoma in situ invasive carcinoma in a frozen section. Therefore, complete performance of the above-mentioned procedure. To do this, first position the tumor with the spreading laryngoscope, then cut around the tumor with the 8 W CO2 laser. The tumor can be sent as a complete specimen for histology. Positive marginal samples with a CIS in the middle of the tongue base and caudal or caudal right. For this reason, at the end of the operation, a resection is taken from the middle of the base of the tongue and a marginal sample is taken. The same is done on the caudal right section. A resection with a final marginal sample is also taken here. Additional resection in the area of the wound base, as the tumor is relatively close to the edges of the wound according to the frozen section. If the mucosal margins in these areas are completely inconspicuous on inspection, these samples are sent for final histology. The tumor at the base of the tongue is generally difficult to control, which is why surgical conditions are also difficult here. In the meantime, radical neck dissection is performed on the right side: skin incision for this. Subcutaneous dissection in depth. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The mass infiltrating the muscle and the accessorius nerve can already be seen here. The digastric muscle is first exposed cranially. The internal jugular vein is shown caudally. This shows that it is probably infiltrated by this tumor, so that the decision is made to sacrifice the internal jugular vein. It is exposed caudally and cranially, ligated and sent for histology together with the radical neck preparation, taking the sternocleidomastoid muscle with it, after resection. Exposure of the accessory nerve and the external and internal carotid arteries. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and protection of the same. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the accessory and hypoglossal nerves. Development of the lateral neck preparation, as already described up to just below the omohyoid muscle. Development of the medial neck preparation, including the capsule of the submandibular gland in the caudal part. Overall, due to the extensive and large metastasis, the surgical conditions were considerably more difficult. Careful wound irrigation in the area of the neck preparation. Insertion of a Redon drain. Multi-layer wound closure. Skin suturing with Monocryl sutures. Application of a pressure bandage. Final inspection at the end, no bleeding. Final consultation with the anesthetist.

The tumor is then resected together with the base of the tongue and the entire epiglottis using support autoscopy and the CO2 laser, with repeated and extremely laborious repositioning of the small water tube. During dissection, the most careful hemostasis is always performed in the event of diffuse bleeding. The tumor is then removed together with the epiglottis, initially above the anterior commissure. Here, further resections are performed in the area of the lower left, lower right and lower front margins. The same marginal samples are then taken and sent for frozen section diagnostics. All marginal samples are found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleagues. After further careful hemostasis, the patient is repositioned, initially for tracheotomy: injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline and disinfection of the skin. Then door leaf incision and layer-by-layer dissection in depth. This reveals an extremely pronounced thyroid isthmus, which is cut on both sides and then lanced. Then expose the anterior surface of the trachea. Then insertion between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp into the trachea. Then creation of the Björk flap and suturing of the flap. Then circular epithelialization of the tracheostoma. The patient is then intubated and receives a size 7 endotracheal tube. The patient is then repositioned for PEG insertion: the flexible instrument is inserted into the esophagus without difficulty. Then visual endoscopy into the stomach. If the diaphanoscopy is positive, the PEG is then placed in the typical position using the thread pull-through method. This is done without complications. After injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline and skin disinfection on both sides of the neck and repositioning of the patient, the operation is continued with neck dissection on both sides: Start on the right side first. To do this, make a skin incision along the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then dissect in depth in layers and expose the neck sheath. Then develop the lateral neck preparation while preserving the structures of the cervical vascular sheath and the accessorius nerve. Suspect enlarged lymph nodes are not revealed during dissection. Then clear the hypoglossal triangle while protecting the branches of the external carotid artery, the hypoglossal nerve and the branches of the facial vein. Then develop the anterior neck preparation while sparing the branches of the internal jugular vein. Problem-free dissection here too. Then most careful hemostasis and insertion of a Redon drainage. Multi-layer wound closure. Then identical procedure on the left side. Here, too, the dissection is carried out while protecting all structures of the cervical vascular sheath and the accessorius nerve. A paired arrangement of the internal jugular vein can be seen here. This divides cranially of the omohyoid muscle into a medial and a lateral branch. In the cranial course, the hypoglossal nerve crosses the two branches. This makes dissection extremely laborious and time-consuming. Ultimately, however, the dissections of the lateral neck and the hypoglossal triangle can be spared, while sparing the branches of the external carotid artery, facial vein and both branches of the internal jugular artery as well as the accessorius nerve. Then complete the neck dissection with the anterior neck preparation, sparing the branches of the medial internal jugular branch. The most careful hemostasis is then applied here too. Also insertion of a Redon drain and multi-layer wound closure. After dressing and insertion of a size 7 tracheostomy tube, the procedure is completed without complications. The patient is transferred to the in-house intensive care unit for monitoring.","Laser resection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement, Bilateral neck dissection (5 Levels)

The anterior neck preparation is removed for the first time between the V. jugularis interna and V. facialis and M. omohyoideus. There are two large metastases on the internal jugular vein at level IIa. In order to gain an overview, the decision is made to remove level II b completely. This can also be done without any problems while sparing the accessorius nerve. Removal of levels III to V with protection of the plexus branches, after visualization of the vagus nerve, the internal carotid artery and the common carotid artery. Approach to level II further on the left side. Careful dissection of the two metastases from the jugular vein. Ultimately, the metastases can be removed without obstructing the jugular vein. Targeted hemostasis. This is a left neck dissection with complete evacuation of level II to V. In the case of macroscopic evidence of two metastases in level II a on the left side.

Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, the posterior belly of the digaster muscle, the left submandibular gland and the accessorius nerve. The cervical vascular sheath is shown. The anterior neck preparation is removed for the first time between the internal jugular vein and facial vein and the omohyoid muscle. Level IIb is then removed above the accessorius nerve. Release of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the plexus branches and the hypoglossal nerve. The branches of the superior thyroid artery as well as the lingual and facial arteries are dissected for a possible anastomosis. Subtle hemostasis. Release of the larynx by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Detachment of the infrahyoid muscles for this purpose. Removal of the hyoid bone. Removal of the oblique laryngeal musculature and exposure of the thyroid cartilage on the right side. Then detachment of the piriform sinus on the right side. Exposure and detachment of the thyroid gland on both sides. On the left side, the piriform sinus cannot be detached due to infiltration of the thyroid cartilage. Enter with the McIVOR oral spatula and start with tumor resection at the lower tonsil pole with the monopolar needle and at the posterior palatal arch. The soft palate is also affected and must be partially resected. Then enter the pharynx from the neck. On the right side, disluxation of the epiglottis. Incision of the mucosa along the edge of the epiglottis up to the right arytenoid cartilage. It then becomes apparent that the tumor fills the entire piriform sinus, goes down to the esophageal entrance and infiltrates the medial wall and the thyroid cartilage. The tumor is cut around with a safety margin of 1.5 cm and the larynx is placed below the cricoid cartilage and marked with a suture. Unfortunately, the vocal folds could not be preserved for the laboratory as the larynx was accidentally placed in formalin by the nursing staff. Then marginal samples were taken. All marginal samples are tumor-free in the frozen section and free of carcinoma in situ. Measurement of the defect. The defect is 15 x 10 cm in size and extends from the tonsil region across the base of the tongue via the pharynx to the entrance to the esophagus. Decision to remove a transplant. The anterolateral thigh graft is suitable for this. Lifting of the anterolateral thigh graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. To do this, draw a line between the lateral edge of the patella and the anterior superior iliac spine. Doppler the perforator vessels on this line. Five perforator vessels are identified and the graft is designed around the perforator vessels, 16 x 10 cm. Primary wound closure is still possible. Incision of the graft at the inferior medial edge. Expose and identify the rectus femoris muscle with its median fascia. Then identify the vastus lateralis muscle and enter the sulcus between these two muscles and identify the descending ramus of the circumflex femoral artery. The vastus lateralis is relatively thin, so that a delicate perforator graft is not lifted here and part of the vastus lateralis muscle is also lifted. Then set down. Then dissection of the pedicle and removal of the graft so that two veins remain, one large and one small. Undermining of the skin. Insertion of two Redon drains and cutting of Burow triangles and multi-layer wound closure in the usual manner. The graft is flushed with heparin and handed over to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who then sutures the graft into the pharynx in two layers. The vascular anastomosis is performed between the facial vein and an outlet from the facial vein. The artery is connected to the common outlet of the facial and lingual arteries. There is very good graft perforation. The graft can be controlled transorally as it goes up into the tonsillar lobes. Two-layer wound closure after insertion of a flap and a Redon drainage. After the laryngectomy, a size 8 Provox-Vega prosthesis was inserted. The patient is ventilated in the intensive care unit and should be on antibiotics for at least 24 hours.

A laryngoscopy was performed using a Kleinsasser C-tube. This revealed a pronounced submucosal mass affecting the entire glottis and the subglottis on both sides over a distance of approx. 3 cm caudally. Thus, the indication for complete laryngectomy can be confirmed due to the pronounced subglottic tumor spread. Placement of a nasogastric feeding tube. Subsequent skin spray disinfection and application of local anesthesia cervically median, skin ablation and sterile draping. Due to the postoperative radiotherapy in the neck area and the lack of indication for neck dissection (postoperative neck dissection 2006, current cN0 status), the decision was made to make a circumscribed zigzag incision in the median cervical region. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Expose the prelaryngeal musculature and push it aside. Exposure from cranial to caudal of the hyoid bone, the thyroid cartilage, the cricoid cartilage and the anterior wall of the trachea. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, transection of the same, treatment of the thyroid surface using bipolar coagulation. Subsequently, due to the clear subglottic extension of the tumor, decision to perform a deep tracheotomy between the 4th and 5th tracheal cartilage clasp. Re-intubation onto a size 8 laryngectomy tube, followed by skeletonization of the larynx, initially at the level of the thyroid cartilage. Perichondrium incision. Dissection of the piriform sinus from the thyroid cartilage leaves on both sides. Skeletonization of the hyoid bone with transection of the supra- and infrahyoid muscles at this level. Expose the epiglottis and perform the median pharyngotomy. Then incision along the aryepiglottic surfaces on both sides. Maximum protection of the piriform sinus on both sides. Transverse incision postcricoid and union of the lateral incisions. Entering the postcricoid area. Complete release of the larynx and the upper trachea from the postcricoid region and the esophagus. Dissection caudally. Resection and sending in of the laryngectomy specimen for intraoperative frozen section examination (suture marking: short-short tracheal separation margin anteriorly, long-long tracheal separation margin posteriorly). The following representative marginal samples are then taken: postcricoid region, right piriform sinus, left piriform sinus, right tongue base, left tongue base. All 5 marginal samples as well as the thread-marked areas on the laryngectomy specimen are found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleagues during the frozen section examination. Perform a cricopharyngeal myotomy. Subsequently, three-layer pharyngeal suture (submucosa, muscular layer, infrahyoid musculature). The pharyngeal suture is reinforced, particularly in the area of the base of the tongue, using cut pieces of Tachosil. Placement of a 10 Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma at the caudal edge of the vertical skin incision. Re-intubation of the patient to a size 10 cannula. Application of a pressure dressing. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient received Unacid 3 g intravenously intraoperatively as a single shot antibiotic.

In the course of a panendoscopy, a cT1 cN2a G3 differentiated oropharyngeal carcinoma was histologically confirmed. There is now an indication for transoral resection, neck dissection and PEG placement. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Team time-out and induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. The oropharyngoscopy is performed first. This reveals the tumor described above, which appears to be located in the area of the glossotonsillar groove. Ventral extension to the middle third of the anterior palatal arch. Subsequently transition to the glossotonsillar groove and into the base of the tongue. The tumor is relatively difficult to palpate as it grows largely submucosally in the area of the base of the tongue. Transition to PEG placement. The endoscope is inserted under visualization and air is constantly insufflated into the stomach. Here the gastric mucosa is inconspicuous on all sides. After a clear positive diaphanoscopy, the PEG tube is inserted using the thread pull-through method in the typical manner. This was performed without any problems. The patient was given 3 g Unacid preoperatively. The patient was then repositioned for transoral tumor resection. Insertion of the self-retaining Jennings retractor and suturing of the tongue. Luxation of the tongue and renewed palpatory identification of the tumor borders. Start of resection in the area of the anterior palatal arch with the electric needle. Resection down to the tonsil. As the tumor extensions are relatively close to the tonsil tissue, the decision is made to resect the tonsil en bloc as well. With constant palpatory identification of the tumor borders, the tumor is successively resected with a clinically macroscopically wide safety margin. In between, bipolar coagulation of small arterial bleedings is performed. The suture marking of the primary tumor is still performed in situ. The anterior margin of the posterior third of the tongue and the glossotonsillar groove as well as the margin of the anterior palatal arch and the medial base of the tongue are marked with sutures. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation. Insertion of an H2O2-soaked hydrogen compress. In the meantime, the specimen has been sent for frozen section diagnostics. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection. Superficial skin disinfection and sterile draping. Mark the planned incision from preauricular to infrolobular and curved towards the caudal side in a bayonet shape in the area of the sternocleidomastoid muscle anterior margin. Sharp transection of the cutis and subcutis. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure and initial protection of the auricularis magnus nerve. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle as the cranial border as well as the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle as the cranial border. Turn to the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and the external and internal carotid arteries. Level II shows that the tumor infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid broadly. The decision was therefore made to resect the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is done using the electric knife, initially caudally. Cranially, the metastatic conglomerate is firmly seated in level II b and appears to infiltrate the caudal parotid pole. The tumor extensions reach up to the carotid bifurcation. However, the tumor can be separated from the external carotid artery and the first branches as well as the internal carotid artery with the Reynold scissors. Exposure and protection of the vagus nerve. It is also apparent that the internal jugular vein is infiltrated cranially by the tumor. It was therefore decided to remove it as well. Double ligation of the same caudally and single ligation cranially. The tumor extends cranially under the digastric muscle. Therefore, removal of the same and lateral beating of the muscle belly. You now have a good view of the internal carotid artery and all external branches. Expose the superior thyroid artery, the lingual artery, the facial artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery. As the tumor also infiltrates the caudal parotid pole, the incision is extended cranially to secure the marginal ramus and the glandular capsule is exposed. Expose the cartilaginous pointer and the main facial trunk. Subsequently, successive dissection along the main trunk and exposure of the frontofacial and cervicofacial bundle. The cervicofacial bundle is dissected further into the periphery, carefully monitoring the marginal ramus. The laterocaudal part of the parotid gland is then removed while sparing the marginal mandibular nerve. The digastric muscle is also dissected dorsally. The same applies to the accessorius nerve, which is also located in the tumor conglomerate. After laborious dissection, the metastatic block can be removed in toto. Only in the area of the carotid bifurcation does a tumor remnant still appear to be present macroscopically. Therefore, meticulous dissection along the vessels and removal of the questionably infiltrated material. Despite the preoperatively small tumor extension, the tumor appears to grow diffusely infiltrating intraoperatively. The dissection extends as far as the pharyngeal musculature. No macroscopic tumor remnants here. Subsequent removal of the remaining medial and lateral neck specimen. Overall removal of levels II to V. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation with H2O2 and NACL. Insertion of a Redon drainage as well as subcutaneous suture and skin suture. Application of a wound dressing. In the meantime, rapid incision announcement by telephone. Microscopic suspicion of R1 status in the area of the wound bed at the anterior margin of the posterior third of the tongue. The patient is therefore repositioned for transoral resection. The complete wound bed is resected and sent for definitive histology (resection of the wound bed of the posterior third of the tongue at the front and resection of the wound bed of the posterior third of the tongue at the back). Subsequently, definitive marginal samples were taken in the area of the wound bed (posterior third of the tongue at the front, posterior third of the tongue at the back). Extensive hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Transfer of the patient intubated and ventilated to the local intensive care unit, as a tracheotomy had not been discussed and planned with the patient in advance. The operation was completed without complications. Conclusion: Due to the extensive and diffuse tumor growth, the patient should be advised to undergo adjuvant radiochemotherapy postoperatively.

Previous endoscopy described as cT1 findings. Now again, before planned transoral or laser resection, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The relatively small exophytic tumor at the lateral base of the tongue on the right side extending to the lateral pharyngeal wall is seen. However, there are now also changes in the area of the lower tonsil pole and in the direction of the hypopharynx, which are suspicious. Overall, however, macroscopically rather small findings. Due to the somewhat more extensive findings after the initial endoscopy, the tumor was now resected with a larger safety margin.","First insert the McIVOR spatula. The tongue and the base of the tongue can be visualized well here, as can the tonsil region and the transition to the alveolar ridge. Cut around the tumor macroscopically with a safety margin of at least 1-1.5 cm on all sides. The tonsil is removed in its entirety. Resection extends over the lateral area of the glossotonsillar or glossoalveolar junction into the base of the tongue. A slightly deeper resection is performed in the base of the tongue if the main tumor is present. The base of the tongue is removed up to the vallecula and the border of the epiglottis or up to the beginning of the hypopharynx. The entire specimen is thread-marked. Due to the somewhat smaller macroscopic distances in the area of the vallecula, base of the tongue and epiglottis, a further marginal sample is taken here, which extends over the base of the tongue, the vallecula to the epiglottis and to the edge of the transition to the hypopharynx. The frozen section still shows in-situ infiltrates caudally at the transition to the hypopharynx and in the area of the caudal tongue base, vallecula and epiglottis. For this reason, another extensive resection is performed with the laser in the hypopharyngeal region: After the tumor has been adjusted, a large, at least 1-1.5 cm wide resected hypopharyngeal mucosa is removed with a 5 watt continuous wave superpulse. A marginal sample is then taken from the entire hypopharyngeal area up to the edge of the larynx or epiglottis. The entire mucosa of the lingual epiglottis up to the edge of the epiglottis is removed from the vallecula area up to the lateral border of the epiglottis. Another strip of mucosa is removed from the vallecula-epiglottis area as a marginal sample, whereby mucosa is now also removed from the front of the epiglottis. The mucosal resection again extends medially to the beginning of the hypopharyngeal inlet. Then, after insertion of the FK blocker, a superficial strip of the entire medially resected tongue base up to the vallecula is obtained as a post-resectate and then another strip as a marginal sample. All three marginal samples are sent in. No more tomorin infiltrates here, so now R0 resection. Overall relatively extensive tumor, but mostly growing superficially. Neck dissection can therefore be performed. Neck dissection is now performed on the right side: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Depiction of the internal jugular vein, internal/external carotid artery. Exposure of the vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. Removal of the lymph nodes from levels II to V, preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Several conspicuous lymph nodes are visible, especially in level II. Dissection somewhat more difficult due to the previous operation in which a lymph node extirpation was performed. Neck dissection on the left side: Here, an arched skin incision starting from the mastoid at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid and bending posteriorly. Exposure of the cervical fascia. Creation of a platysmal flap. Exposure of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid. Dissection in depth. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Now dissect in the direction of the digaster muscle. Trace the digaster muscle cranially. The facial vein is exposed here. Trace the facial vein caudally. Expose the internal jugular vein and the cervical vascular sheath. Now successively detach the anterior triangle, which goes to the final histology. Dissection up to the plexus branches. Now detachment of level II a, after exposure of the accessorius nerve. Break through the neck preparation under the nerve. Further dissection caudally. This exposes the hypoglossal nerve. Successive detachment of the neck preparation in levels II a and III and IV. The preparation is sent for final histology. Irrigation with Wassertoff and Ringer. No evidence of further bleeding. Insertion of a 10 redon. Platys suture. Skin suturing and completion of the neck dissection. A tracheotomy was also performed during the operation after it became clear that the operation would be more extensive. Repositioning for tracheotomy. Palpation of the cricoid cartilage. 3 cm long skin incision at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. This is split in the middle. Exposure of the anterior surface of the thyroid gland. Tunneling of the thyroid gland on the trachea from the cricoid cartilage caudally. Bipolar coagulation of the thyroid gland and transection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the trachea. Incision between the second and third cartilage clasps with the 15 mm scalpel. Widen the incision so that a sufficiently large tracheotomy is created. Now suture caudally and cranially. The lateral skin ends are closed with skin sutures. Insertion of an LE tube without complications. PEG insertion is necessary if the resection is extended. However, the patient underwent intestinal surgery with insertion of a Vicryl mesh alio loco. The scar extends into the upper abdomen. Mesh insertion was probably also palpated here. Therefore, despite the possibility of diaphanoscopy, a PEG was not inserted. This should be performed by colleagues in internal medicine or surgery. A transnasal feeding tube was inserted for nutrition. The procedure was completed without complications. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Overall extensive tumor, which had only grown superficially in situ. In any case, N2b status on the right. Please continue postoperative antibiotics for one week. Feeding via feeding tube or PEG for approx. 7-8 days, then, depending on swallowing function, cautious diet build-up.

Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the tumor. The tumor starts in the area of the soft palate, moves to the tonsillar lobe on the right side, then from the tonsillar lobe to the base of the tongue and into the vallecula, from the vallecula to the epiglottis and from the epiglottis to the pharyngo-epiglottic fold on both sides, but on the right more than on the left, from the pharyngo-epiglottic fold to the pocket fold, on the right more than on the left. Injection and sterile washing and covering. Start with transoral tumor resection in the area of the soft palate. The monopolar needle, bipolar forceps and scissors are used for this. The tumor is released in the area of the soft palate and the tonsil lobe as well as partially at the base of the tongue. This automatically leads to the soft tissues of the neck, then switch to the neck, as the transoral view is no longer available. Now expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Expose the cervical vascular sheath and continue the tumor resection via a pharyngotomy from the outside. The tumor is dislocated outwards using the pull-through technique and resected en bloc on the right side and on the left side, taking two thirds of the hyoid bone and taking the epiglottis, vallecula and partial pocket fold with it. This resulted in a very large defect. The entire supraglottis had to be removed, leaving just the arytenoids on both sides and the vocal fold region. Now joint consideration of the next steps with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Due to the extensive pharyngeal defect and the pending transplant, it does not make sense to preserve the rest of the larynx, as a pronounced permanent aspiration must be assumed. The vocal folds will also no longer be functional due to the narrow resection margins and the suturing to the graft. Hence the decision to remove the rest of the larynx and insert a Provox prosthesis. This is done in the usual way. Measurement of the defect 5 x 8 x 13 cm. The graft is configured in such a way that there is a bulge for the base of the tongue so that there is a sliding surface for tongue mobility later on. The graft is lifted from the forearm in the usual way using <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Lifting of the radialis graft on the left forearm by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Marking of the skin graft on the distal forearm in the presence of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. S-shaped skin incision in the area of the proximal forearm up to the crook of the elbow and incision around the marked radialis graft. Visualization of the superficial venous system in the area of the S-shaped skin incision. A pronounced cephalic vein can be seen, which is traced and visualized from proximal to distal further to the radial flap edge. Dissection of the radial edge of the flap down to the deep forearm fascia and incision of this. Exposure of the external ramus of the radial nerve and protection of the nerve. Exposure of the brachioradialis radialis muscle. Ulnar skin incision down to the deep forearm fascia and incision of the fascia. Subfascial dissection leaving the peritendineum and perimysium intact. Distal skin incision and ligation of the superficial veins. Identification of the radial artery with the accompanying V. comitans. Blunt detachment from the vascular bed and clipping of the distal radial artery stump for approx. 5 minutes. A good perfusion signal is noted during this time. Then decide on distal pedicle transection and vessel ligation. Exposure of the extensor carpi radialis muscle. Dissection of the flap pedicle from the depth with constant hemostasis using vascular clips. The radial nerve can be spared well. Insertion of a retractor between the extensor carpi radialis and brachioradialis muscles. Vessel preparation up to the crook of the elbow. Insertion of <CLINICIAN_NAME> and exposure of the confluence. Separation of the radial artery just before the interosseous artery. Separation of the venous vessels at the superficial and deep venous system. This is followed by removal of an equivalent piece of split skin from the right thigh by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Incision of the split-thickness skin graft in the usual manner. Sterile wound dressing. Application of a dorsal forearm splint. There was always a good perfusion signal during the operation. Neck dissection on both sides parallel to flap elevation. Start on the right side. Free preparation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. The digastric muscle has already been dissected for the tumor resection. The hypoglossal nerve, accessory nerve and plexus branches can be spared. The facial vein cannot be spared. Remove the neck specimen II a to V a en bloc. Then turn to the opposite side. Here too, visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, the accessorius nerve, the hypoglossal nerve and removal of the neck preparation II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. The facial vein and another caudal vein branch from the internal jugular vein can be preserved here. Dissection and preparation of these two venous outlets and the superior thyroid artery for the flap connection. Suturing of the graft. To do this, start transorally in the area of the soft palate and the edge of the tongue as well as the alveolar ridge, then suture the rest of the graft transcervically. At the end, suture the anastomoses in the usual manner. Microsurgical insertion of two Redon drains and two-layer wound closure. Please continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours.

Now resection of the tongue tumor from the enoral side after insertion of the mouth guard, starting at the tip of the tongue, almost in the median line dorsally with the monopolar. The mass, which on the surface only appears as a small ulcer on the left side between the edge of the tongue and the floor of the mouth, shows extensive infiltrative growth in depth and spherical growth towards the body of the tongue. The tumor is now gradually bypassed dorsally towards the base of the tongue and resection is now performed in the area of the base of the tongue towards the floor of the mouth. Here, the tumor is also bypassed with an appropriate safety margin. The tumor also shows a cone-like growth in depth, which is carefully bypassed and lifted accordingly. The neck is now dissected, first on the left side. To do this, make a skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid, ending in a skin fold. Dissection of the platysmal flap and dissection of the sternocleidomastoid anterior edge. Exposure of the vascular nerve sheath and further dissection along the omohyoid muscle to the hyoid bone. Dissection along the digastric muscle towards the base of the skull and removal of levels II, III and IV. Level V is then removed, as there are two macroscopically conspicuous lymph nodes in level IIa. All vascular and nerve structures in the neck area are spared after exposure and re-embedding of nerves X, XI, XII. This is followed by exposure and re-embedding of the marginal ramus and mandibular nerve and dissection and removal of level Ib, including the submandibular gland. This results in a thorough effect in the complete removal of the basal margin of the tumor. The large penetrating defect is used in the further course of the reconstruction, the pedicle pull-through. This is followed by neck dissection on the right side. The skin incision is the same as on the left. Dissection of the platysmal flap and exposure of the vascular nerve sheath. Careful evacuation of level II, III and IV without evidence of macroscopically conspicuous lymph nodes. Redon drainage is inserted here, subcutaneous and skin sutures are used. N. hypoglossus, N. accessorius and N. vagus are exposed and re-embedded. The next step is to lift the forearm graft after carefully measuring the tissue to be lifted. The graft is marked accordingly on the forearm, prepared and lifted from distal to proximal. The lifting ends in the area of the crook of the elbow and the superficial and deep venous system is taken along. The radial ramus superficial nerve is exposed and spared during dissection. The tourniquet is opened and careful hemostasis is performed. The graft is then removed and incorporated enorally to reconstruct the tongue and floor of the mouth. After appropriate incorporation, the vessels are anastomosed in the sense of an end-to-end anastomosis of the superior thyroid artery with the radial artery and end-to-end anastomosis of the flap vein with a branch of the facial vein using a size 3.0 coupler. Checking the vascular flows, which are excellent, and finally subcutaneous sutures and skin sutures here too. The lifting defect in the area of the right forearm is covered with full-thickness skin, which is lifted in the area of the right groin, and partially closed primarily. Application of a vacuum dressing and a Kramer splint to immobilize the forearm. The groin wound is treated with a Redon drain and closed primarily with subcutaneous sutures and skin sutures. After re-inspection of the findings, minimal swelling and a completely clear airway, a tracheostomy is not performed at this stage. This may have to be done secondarily. The vascular signals to be duplicated are drawn in the neck area.","Tongue partial resection, Floor of mouth partial resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage (Radial), Endoscopy

Insertion of mouth guard. Entry with the spreading laryngoscope. Positioning of the tumor. This appears slightly larger than described with slightly flatter extensions downwards and also medially. Endoscopically controlled laser resection of the tumor is now performed. The tumor is incised on all sides with a safety margin of at least 10 mm and removed macroscopically and microscopically in the healthy tissue. Resection includes the lateral arytenoid fold, anterior piriform sinus wall and lateral piriform sinus wall up to the tip, the piriform sinus caudally and the beginning of the base of the tongue cranially. The tumor is removed in several sections.

All marginal samples were tumor-free in the frozen section. Thus R0 status. Careful hemostasis is now performed. The operation is completed when the site is free of bleeding. Due to the patient's overall situation, a tracheostomy is initially not performed. The patient should be transferred to intensive care and extubated the next day in a controlled manner; if complications arise here, a tracheostomy is probably unavoidable. Neck dissection necessary on both sides at intervals with N+ status. Feeding via the inserted gastric tube and diet build-up after 5 to 7 days or swallowing training. Tracheotomy by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Marking of the landmarks, sterile abjodation. Skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Now strict perforation in the midline down to the prelaryngeal musculature, where a larger vein is ligated on both sides. Cut through the prelaryngeal muscles and push them aside. Now locate the cricoid cartilage and dissect the thyroid gland below the cricoid cartilage. Careful dissection of the trachea and undermining of the thyroid gland. Bipolar coagulation of the thyroid gland and transection of the thyroid gland. Exposure of the trachea using pedicle swabs. The trachea is now exposed in a clearly visible area. After consultation with the anaesthetist, enter the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage and create a visor tracheotomy. Suturing of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Problem-free reintubation blocked on an 8 mm cannula.","Laser resection, Tracheotomy

Sterile washing and draping. Creation of an apron flap and start of neck dissection on the right side. The skin over the metastases is dissected off for this purpose; the platysma cannot be spared in part as it is adherent to the metastases. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the caudal region. Separation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. Dissection of the large metastases from the internal jugular vein in the caudal region. Then removal of the omohyoid muscle. Dissection of the common carotid artery. Dissection of the division into external and internal carotid artery. Both divisions can be preserved, but the facial artery runs directly into the tumor. The superior thyroid artery also enters the tumor. The hypoglossal nerve and the accessory nerve extend into this metastatic tumor, as do the plexus branches, all of which are completely resected. The submandibular gland is partially resected. The neck conglomerate is sent for final histology with suture marking. Level II b is then removed and sent for histology. Neck dissection on the left side is performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. After subplatysmal dissection of the apron flap up to the submandibular gland, the neck is dissected on the left side. Open the capsule of the submandibular gland and dissect in depth to expose the digastric muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and exposure of the nerve. This can be completely preserved. Dissection of the neck specimen along the anterior venter of the digastric muscle and detachment of the specimen up to the hyoid bone. Exposure of the facial vein. Identification of the hypoglossal nerve. The facial vein can be preserved. Sharp dissection on the vein and lateral striking of the neck preparation. The vein can be completely detached from the neck specimen by inserting a .............................. The common carotid artery and vagus nerve are exposed. The neck preparation is now detached from the deep cervical fascia from cranial to caudal. Particular care is taken to spare the deep branches of the cervical plexus. The accessorius nerve is also not injured. After releasing the neck preparation, inspect the wound area. After hemostasis with the bipolar coagulation forceps, there is no further bleeding. After removal of the neck specimen at the level of the junction of the omohyoid muscle and the internal jugular vein, there is no evidence of a chyle fistula. Exposure of the outlets of the external carotid artery (the superior thyroid artery and the facial artery can be safely exposed and dissected). Completion of the neck dissection on the left side without complications. Now release of the larynx by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Skeletonization of the hyoid bone. Removal of the hyoid bone. Release of the piriform sinus. Neck level VI was removed beforehand. Then entering the pharynx from the left side. It can be seen that the tumor grows very far into the base of the tongue. Tumor resection with a safety margin of 1 ˝ cm. Cut down towards the postcricoid region, first on the left side, then on the right side. Some of the pharynx must also be resected on the right side. Then place the larynx below the cricoid cartilage and send the specimen marked with a suture for frozen section. All frozen sections are designated as R0, but at one point with a safety margin of just under 0.2 cm. A resection of the pharyngeal mucosa on the left side is taken, which is then also designated as R0. Now insertion of a Provox Vega prosthesis size 10 in the usual manner. Mobilization of the base of the tongue and the pharynx in the cranial region. Pharyngeal suture in the usual manner in two layers. A T-shaped suture must be applied in the area of the base of the tongue, as otherwise there is too much tension due to the relatively large amount of mucosa missing here. However, due to the overall situation of the patient and the still sufficient mucosa for a primary closure, the decision is made against a free graft or a pedicled graft. Finally, a mucocutaneous anastomosis is created at the tracheostoma. Insertion of Redon drains. Two-layer wound closure and completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours. X-ray gruel swallow in this case only after the 14th postoperative day.","Laryngectomy, Partial pharyngectomy, Neck dissection

Insertion of a covered retractor. Snare the tongue, then inspect the tumor region. The tumor extends from the base of the tongue to the tonsil region to the anterior and posterior palatal arch and passes over to the soft palate and extends to the base of the uvula, but does not infiltrate it. First transoral tumor resection using a monopolar needle, scissors and bipolar forceps so that the tumor is detached from the soft palate and the tonsil region as well as from the tongue margin. Then switch to the transcervical approach. To do this, make a skin incision in a transverse skin fold 2 ˝ cm below the lower jaw. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Showing the submandibular gland. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. First resection of the submandibular gland. The lower part of the tumor is then immediately encountered. A pharyngotomy is performed here, then the tumor is dislocated transcervically and successively cut around. It can be removed en bloc. The entire tumor is then thread-marked and sent for frozen section. In the frozen section, all edges are tumor-free. Basally in the area of the tongue, the margins are only very narrowly resected. Therefore, a resection is made here again, which is sent for final histology. Now complete the neck dissection. For this, free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the N. accessorius, the V. facialis, which must be removed, the A. thyroidea superior and removal of the neck IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Measurement of the defect reveals a fairly large defect in the area of the edge of the tongue and the oropharynx. The flap is then configured so that one part can cover the posterior pharyngeal wall and one part goes to the tongue with a notch so that the tongue is not fixed later. This graft is drawn onto the forearm. Then cut around the skin. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the cephalic vein, exposure of the deep venous system in the crook of the elbow. The patient has no direct confluence in the crook of the elbow between the superficial and deep systems. The cephalic vein is therefore directly integrated with the graft. Exposure of the superficial ramus, radial nerve, this divides into 2 branches, unfortunately one branch cannot be preserved, but the larger main branch remains. Then visualization of the radial artery, clamping, ligation and repositioning of the radial artery. Detach the graft from the tendon bed, then dissect the pedicle in the usual way. Smaller vessels are clipped and bipolar coagulated. Then dissection of the vessel outlet in the elbow area. Exposure and identification of the ulnar and interosseous arteries. The radial artery is removed distally from its outlet. The cephalic vein and a larger accompanying vessel of the radial artery are dissected for the venous connection. The arm is then closed in the usual way using split skin. Neck dissection on the left side and tracheotomy by <CLINICIAN_NAME> are now performed in parallel with graft elevation. Now proceed to the tracheotomy: First mark the landmarks (jugulum, cricoid cartilage, thyroid incisura). Mark the skin incision. This is located at mid-height between the jugulum and the cricoid cartilage. Skin incision at a length of approx. 4 cm. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue. Two larger veins must be ligated and cut. Then dissect the linea alba of the infrahyoid musculature. Spread the muscles apart. Finding the thyroid isthmus. This is now dissected along the trachea. Then insertion of the Pean clamps and transection of the isthmus after bipolar coagulation. Ligation of the left and right isthmus. Free preparation of the trachea. Entering the trachea after preoxygenation between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Formation of a Björk flap and tracheocutaneous anastomosis in the typical manner. Retubing of the patient to a 9-gauge cannula. Proceed to neck dissection on the left side. The incision is first made at a length of approx. 7 to 8 cm, approx. 2 transverse fingers below the mandible in a skin fold. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and separation of the platysma and formation of a platysmal flap. This is exposed cranially and caudally. The anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is then dissected caudally to the omohyoid muscle, which is then dissected cranially/medially. Further dissection of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Locate the submandibular gland. Dissection of the caudal glandular capsule and insertion into the anterior neck preparation. Locate the digaster venter muscle posteriorly and move along it anteriorly as far as the hyoid. Release the anterior neck preparation while protecting the hypoglossal nerve, which can be visualized and protected. Now dissect the cervical vascular sheath. The internal jugular vein and facial vein are exposed and spared. The common carotid artery and external carotid artery are exposed and spared, as are the vagus nerve and the cervical artery. The accessorius nerve is then explored. Dissection of level II b. Detachment of the fatty tissue with the lymph nodes along the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein to level IV caudally, level V is also removed. The fatty tissue is ligated and removed caudally in level IV. Detachment of the lateral neck preparation. Subsequent insertion of an 8 Redon drain. Subcutaneous suture with 3.0 Vicryl and skin suture with 4.0 Ethilon. Now insertion of the graft, first transcervically, then transorally. This is relatively difficult as the uvula, tongue and the entire oral mucosa are very swollen. In the end, the graft can be inserted completely. The vessels for the anastomosis are now exposed. For this purpose, the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein as well as an outlet from the internal jugular vein are taken. Finally, an artery and two veins are connected, which is successful without any problems and ensures good perfusion in the graft area. Insertion of a flap and two-layer wound closure. Re-intubation to a 9 mm tracheostomy tube. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please X-ray pre-swallow on the 10th postoperative day, until then nutrition via the previously inserted PEG tube. The PEG tube was inserted with good diaphanoscopy using the thread pull-through method.","Combined tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), PEG placement, Tracheotomy

Extension to the midline and cones in the direction of the external musculature or floor of mouth muscles. Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery is indicated.","First, laryngoscopy and pharyngoscopy again: confirmation of tumor spread and the probability of flap coverage. Subsequent PEG insertion: insertion of the esophagoscope. After creation of the diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall probe without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Then repositioning for transoral tumor resection: insertion of the retractors and insertion of the tongue bridle suture. Successive removal of the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm on all sides, also in the area of the soft tissue of the tongue. This results in a complete hemiglossectomy except for the anterior tip of the tongue, which crosses the midline in the posterior region and extends down to the base of the tongue. The glossoalveolar groove and the beginning of the tonsil lobe are also resected. The lingual nerve is partially preserved, as is the wharton duct. Tumor is completely removed macroscopically in the healthy tissue. Tumor is thread-marked. The uncinate process is removed basally as a marginal sample, as are parts of the mylohyoid muscle and external tongue muscles as basal marginal samples in the front. In addition, an extensive marginal sample of the floor of the mouth/base of tongue muscles from the area of the glossotonsillar groove to the base of the tongue. The latter two marginal samples, as well as the entire preparation, are thread-marked for frozen section. In the frozen section, the specimen and all marginal specimens are removed in healthy tissue, thus R0 resection. Measure the size of the flap, which is 12 x 6-7 cm. Careful hemostasis. Subsequent repositioning for continuation of the operation. Skin disinfection and sterile draping of all necessary surgical areas including the left forearm and right thigh. Neck dissection on the right is performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Skin incision in typical manner, exposure of sternocleidomastoid muscle anterior border, dissection of fat lymph node preparation. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, external jugular vein, facial vein. Exposure of internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, exposure of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. All structures are preserved. Removal of the fat lymph node preparation from levels II to IV as well as Va and b below the branches of the cervical plexus. Neck dissection on the left side is then performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and is carried out in the same way as on the right side with removal of levels II to V. Then tracheostoma creation: this is performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Small Kocher collar incision. Exposure of infrahyoid muscles, division of these. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, which is undercut, clamped, severed and supplied by puncture ligation. Exposure of the trachea. Entering the trachea in the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Creation of a wide pedicled modified Björk flap. Epithelialization of this. Re-intubation and insertion of an 8 mm Woodbridge tube. Then radialis flap harvesting: marking of the flap size, this is 12 x 7 cm. The flap is first lifted subfacially from the ulnar side. The incision is then extended to the elbow. Then expose the superficial venous system and lift it subfascially. Then expose the connection to the deep venous system. The flap is then lifted off radially. This is done subfascially. Exposure of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. This is preserved. Distal exposure of the radial vein and artery, which is first clamped. After sufficient clamping time with always sufficiently high saturation of 95 to 100 %, the radial artery is removed. Successive lifting of the flap with the pedicle subfascially. Smaller vessels are clipped or bipolar coagulated. Exposure of the entry of the radial artery into the brachial artery in the antecubital fossa. After clamping and a certain necessary waiting time, the interosseous artery is supplied with clips and cut. A large venous outlet from the cephalic vein can be visualized in the antecubital fossa. The confluence can also be visualized, although it is very small. Finally, the radial artery is first removed at the brachial artery. Treatment with 6-0 Vascufil sutures over and under. Hand perfusion then remains stable. Removal of the veins. These are ligated proximally in the stumps. The flap pedicle is then flushed with heparin via the veins and artery. The flap is now inserted enorally into the defect. The stalk is passed through a tunnel into the neck parts; the submandibular gland is resected first. The Wharton's duct is cut off. The lingual nerve is preserved as far as possible. A sufficiently wide tunnel is now created. The stalk is inserted into the soft tissues of the neck on the right. The flap is initially sutured into the defect with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures, partly by advancing the flap and preserving the continuous pedicle. The defect can be covered completely and without tension. The vessels are then conditioned. After conditioning, the radial artery is anastomosed with the superior thyroid artery using 9-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and good venous return. The two outlets of the superficial venous system are then conditioned. The external jugular artery is removed, ligated proximally and supplied distally with a clamp, flushed with heparin and conditioned. The V. thyroidea media is also removed and rinsed with heparin and conditioned after clamping and removal with ligation. The anastomosis between the larger outlet of the superficial venous system and the external jugular vein is performed using a 3-0 coupler. After opening the clamp, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. Subsequent anastomosis between the smaller outlet of the cephalic vein and the V. thyroidea media with a 2.5 mm coupler. This was also without complications, positive smear phenomenon, good venous return. The flap pedicle is then inserted into the soft tissues of the neck and sutured slightly medio-cranially to prevent tortuosity. The sides of the neck are completely irrigated and extensive hemostasis is performed. The wound was closed in layers by inserting a Redon drain on the left and 2 Penrose drains on the right, which were fixed with sutures and the tracheostoma was epithelized. In the forearm area, the wound is closed proximally in layers. The skin is then closed using split skin. This is first removed from the right thigh in a sufficient size of approx. 13 x 7 cm. A hydrocolloid dressing is applied to the thigh. The split skin is gradually worked into the defect, creating a complete tension-free wound closure. Octenidin gel is applied to the split skin and Mepilex is applied on top. Loose compresses are applied to the Mepilex. The forearm is then wrapped in absorbent cotton. Fitting of a Cramer splint. Fixation with a tape bandage in the functional position of the hand. Hand always sufficiently and well supplied with blood until the end. Attachment of the arm. Checking the flap enorally. This is well supplied with blood. Woodbridge tube is replaced between 8 mm tracheal cannula which is fixed with sutures. The sites of the vascular anastomoses are marked on the skin using sutures. The procedure is completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue the antibiotic treatment, which was started intraoperatively with Unacid, for one week postoperatively. Feeding via the PEG tube for 7-10 days, then dietary support according to flap status. If necessary, X-ray paps. Heparin perfusor, which was started intraoperatively at 500 E/h, should be continued postoperatively for 5 days. Flap control according to the scheme clinically by enoral inspection or also by checking the Doppler probe. Overall cT2-3 tongue margin carcinoma also tending towards cT4 due to infiltration of the external tongue muscles and the floor of the mouth. Waiting for the postoperative histology and presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference regarding adjuvant therapy.","Transoral tumor resection with almost hemiglossectomy, Neck dissection, Tracheostomy and PEG placement, Defect coverage

Due to the size and depth of growth, defect coverage using a flap was indicated.","First of all, position the patient again and perform the pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The exophytic tumor is seen, which extends from the tonsil lobe next to the uvula over the side wall into the base of the tongue or into the piriform sinus entrance. Due to the poor mouth opening and the narrow conditions, tracheostoma placement is now absolutely necessary before tumor resection for a better overview. PEG insertion: insertion of the esophagoscope. Pre-viewing into the stomach, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube in a typical manner after establishing a sufficient diaphanoscopy. This is also fixed to the stomach wall in a typical manner without any problems. Now sterile draping of all areas, injection of a total of 20 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. First tracheostoma placement by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Small Kocher collar incision, dissection through the subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature, which is split. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, which is passed underneath, clamped, cut and supplied by means of a puncture ligature. Subsequent exposure of the trachea. Small visor flap or modified Björk flap. Epithelialization of this. Subsequent reintubation. Neck dissection on the left: Incision typically extended slightly caudally and cranially. Exposure of sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of digastric muscle, omohyoid muscle. Cranially there is a conglomerate of lymph nodes, which clinically corresponds to metastases. Visualization of the internal jugular vein, facial vein. Visualization of the internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, superior thyroid artery, facial artery and lingual artery. Exposure of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, border cord and hypoglossal nerve. Clearing level II-V. Subsequent removal of the submandibular gland, including removal of some level Ib lymph nodes. Wharton's duct is ligated. The digastric muscle was also resected. Branches of the cervical plexus were exposed and preserved. Subsequent exposure of the internal and external carotid arteries and the internal jugular vein as well as the vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and glossopharyngeal nerve, initially up to the base of the skull. Nerves are dissected from the pharyngeal wall with vessel loops. The pharyngeal wall is lifted away from the prevertebral fascia. All soft tissues except for the hypoglossal nerve are mobilized towards the pharyngeal wall. The lateral hyoid bone and the upper parts of the superior concha are also mobilized. The lingual artery is ligated and turned laterally, as are the vein and facial artery. Then, starting transorally, the tumor is resected cranially with the entire wall. This is done caudally as far as the overview allows. Subsequently, further resection of the tumor from the transcervical side. Tumor is removed with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm, in some cases up to 2 cm on all sides. Macroscopically clear in healthy tissue. The palatal arch falls to the left of the uvula both anteriorly and posteriorly, resection quite close to the tube. Pharyngeal wall in the area of the posterior wall up to the middle. Complete lateral wall up to the floor of the mouth in front. Resection extends into the piriform sinus, also includes parts of the vallecula up to the epiglottis and lateral parts of the base of the tongue. The specimen is marked with a suture and sent for frozen section. In the frozen section from the cranial to the alveolar ridge still severe dysplasia, also from the alveolar ridge to the base of the tongue. In situ infiltrates and partly microinvasive carcinoma caudally in the area of the entrance to the piriform sinus. Several extensive resections are therefore performed. A resection includes mucosa and some underlying tissue from the uvula to the alveolar ridge, thickness at least 1-1.5 cm. All sutures remote from the tumor. Further resection from the lateral area of the alveolar ridge to the base of the tongue via the floor of the mouth, also approx. 1 cm thick, sutures also tumor-free. A further marginal sample from the border area to the tube in the nasopharynx. Another from the caudal base of the tongue. Another caudal marginal sample is taken from the lingual epiglottis via the vallecula to the arytenoid fold and the piriform sinus, which extends medially to the resection border on the posterior pharyngeal wall. Here too, the sutures are remote from the tumor, thickness a good cm. In the frozen section, all marginal samples without dysplasia or carcinoma. Hemostasis now follows. Irrigation. Measurement of the defect size. This is 13.5 x 7.5 cm, flap is planned according to the size and required three-dimensional defect coverage. Neck dissection on the right: skin incision as on the opposite side but more limited. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the digastric muscle. Subsequent evacuation level II-IV. Exposure of internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, superior thyroid artery, facial vein, internal jugular vein. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve. Levels II-IV are evacuated, preserving branches of the cervical plexus. Subsequent careful hemostasis and layered wound closure with insertion of a Redon drainage. Then elevation of the radial flap, surgeons: <CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Marking of the flap in the appropriate size and three-dimensional orientation. Then elevate the flap first from ulnar, subfascial, then extend the incision cranially to the olecranon. Exposure of the superficial venous system. Exposure of the connection to the deep venous system. The superficial venous system is then elevated subfascially. The flap is now elevated from the radial, subfascial side. The lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve is exposed and preserved as far as possible. The radial artery and radial vein are exposed caudally and initially clamped. Further elevation of the flap from lateral to medial. Lift the flap off the brachioradialis muscle. Further exposure of the superficial venous system. A venencephalica can be visualized medially and laterally. The radial artery is then cut and treated using 4-0 Prolene puncture ligatures. The flap is then removed subfascially. Outgoing vessels are clipped or treated using bipolar ligatures. Lifting of the flap cranially along the pedicle. Depiction of the interosseous artery, which is severed. Exposure of the entrance of the radial artery into the brachial artery. Depiction of confluence. Subsequent removal of the flap. The veins are ligated and the artery is supplied with Vascufil 6-0 puncture ligatures. The saturation in the hand area is always within the normal range until the end of flap elevation. After removal of the flap, it is flushed with heparin. The flap is then inserted into the defect. The flap is first sutured caudally, partly with the sutures in place. Subsequently, also partly with the sutures in place on the cranial side. Sufficient, tension-free defect coverage is achieved using the flap. The pedicle is inserted caudally into the soft tissues of the neck. The facial artery is selected and conditioned for the anastomosis. After conditioning the radial artery, suture using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial pulse and flow, good venous return. Then, starting from the facial nerve, one vein is conditioned for the anastomosis with the cephalic vein and a smaller one for the anastomosis with the confluence. The second cephalic vein is partly unsuitable for anastomosis due to thickened walls, probably due to scarring after infusion; it is clipped later. The smaller outlet of the facial vein is anastomosed with the confluence using a 2-0 coupler. Positive smear phenomenon after opening the clamps, good venous flow. Another outlet is clipped here. The larger outlet of the facial vein is anastomosed with the cephalic vein after conditioning using a 3-0 coupler. Here too, good venous return after opening the clamp. Positive smear phenomenon. Small outlets are also clipped here. Final inspection of the flap, which is regular. A tracheal cannula is inserted and fixed with sutures. The procedure is then completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue the intraoperative antibiotic treatment with Unacid 3 g for one week. Please continue heparin perfusor 500 E/h for 5 days. Control of the flap according to the scheme clinically and by means of Doppler sonography for 5 days. Site for Doppler was thread-marked. Flap control clinically well possible. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube for 10 days, followed by gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Overall, at least cT3 oropharyngeal carcinoma cN1-cN2b. Waiting for the final histology and presentation or discussion in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Tumor resection, Right-sided neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

A PET-CT scan carried out beforehand showed a multiple enhancement in the area of the right base of the tongue. In addition, the FDG-PET also showed multiple enhancement in the area of the cervical lymph node metastasis on the right side and in the distal colon (colonoscopy recommended here). Based on the findings, the above-mentioned operation is indicated.","Transfer of the patient to the operating theater. Active patient identification. Team time-out and initial consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Induction of anesthesia by the colleagues. 0° tracheoscopy by the surgeon: the trachea is free of irritation and inconspicuous on all sides, the trachea is visible up to the carina. Intubation of the patient by the anesthesia colleagues. Positioning of the patient in the head reclination position and insertion of the small bore tube size C. Inspection of the hypopharynx, first on the left, then on the right side. The piriform sinus must be freely unfolded on both sides and free of masses. Now adjust the endolarynx. Here also inconspicuous conditions. Withdrawal of the small aqueous humor tube and inspection of the epiglottis and vallecula. Here also inconspicuous conditions. Insertion of the mouth retractor and inspection of the oropharynx. In the area of the right base of the tongue, a cherry stone-sized mass measuring approx. 1 cm was found, which was palpable. The other regions of the oropharynx were unremarkable. Demonstration of the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME> and decision to perform an excisional biopsy or tumor resection. Incision of the mucosa with an electric needle. Dissection with scissors through the tongue muscles under constant palpatory control. Bipolar coagulation of individual vessels. It becomes apparent that the tumor extends to the glossotonsillar groove on the right side. Therefore, generous tumor resection also in the area of the glossotonsillar groove so that the parapharyngeal fatty tissue is exposed. Removal of the tumor with healthy marginal tissue without complications. In addition, a resection is made in the area of the glossotonsillar groove, as the resection was only just made here macroscopically. The specimen is sent for histological frozen section examination. Feedback from the pathologist at 12:30: Main tumor specimen with a squamous cell carcinoma (forming a margin to the glossotonsillar groove). In the resection in the area of the glossotonsillar groove, however, resected R0. Due to the deep resection down to the parapharyngeal fat on the right side, the planned neck dissection on the right was not performed. This should be performed twice in 3 weeks in order to avoid an extensive defect. The patient is now repositioned and the decision is made to perform the neck dissection on the left side. To do this, make a skin incision in the area of a skin fold along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Subplatysmal dissection cranially until the submandibular gland is exposed. Subplatysmal dissection caudally to expose the omohyoid muscle. Free preparation of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle down to the depth. Identification of the accessor nerve and exposure of the nerve. This can be safely spared. Identification of the posterior venter of the digastric muscle. Division of the neck preparation in the medial and lateral part on the internal jugular vein. Reliable identification of the vagus nerve and the common carotid artery. Identification of the hypoglossal nerve. Now detach the neck preparation from cranial to caudal and pull through under the accessorius nerve. The neck preparation is carefully dissected from the deep cervical fascia. The branches of the cervical plexus can be safely spared. Check the wound again: dry wound conditions prevail everywhere. Irrigation with Ringer. Application of a Redon drainage and two-layer wound closure. Recheck of the enoral findings. There is no further bleeding enorally. The operation is completed without complications.","Tumor resection, Left-sided neck dissection, Panendoscopy

Adjustment of the glottic plane, overall positioning is limited, but the overview in the area of the anterior commissure is ultimately possible thanks to external counterpressure. Demonstration of findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, decision to perform transoral laser resection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Now determination of the resection limits, anterior resection up to the anterior commissure, posterior resection of the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage on the right, the tumor itself has an extension of approx. 0.5 x 0.5 cm and is located in the posterior to middle third of the right vocal fold. The surrounding tissue appears altered in the sense of chronic hyperplastic laryngitis, making it difficult to differentiate between the mucosa and the tumor, even under the microscope. Laser resection is now performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> alternately, the tumor is resected in toto and macroscopically in sano. A large posterior margin specimen and a supraglottic and anterior margin specimen are then taken in the area of the midline of the anterior commissure, the margin specimens are sent for frozen section examination, the main specimen is sent for histological processing marked with a thread. Hemostasis is then achieved by monopolar coagulation and application of suprarenin-soaked swabs. The frozen section still shows carcinoma in situ in the area of the anterior cranial margin sample, so a laser resection is performed here and the resected specimen is sent for final histological processing. Subsequent resection of margin samples, which are tumor-free in the frozen section, thus intraoperative R0 resection. Hemostasis again. Removal of all foreign material. Removal of the head position and completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Transoral laser resection of a cT1a vocal fold carcinoma occupying the right vocal fold, intraoperatively R0 in the frozen section.

This is only affected on the left side with a CIS. The tumor extension is made more difficult by the slightly overhanging supraglottis, so that a narrow strip of supraglottis is first removed by laser surgery. The tumor is then resected starting at the anterior commissure. The periosteum is exposed at the front and the altered vocal fold area is detached in a healthy layer. Extend the laser resection laterally as far as necessary so that healthy tissue can always be prepared or resected by laser surgery. The first part of the tumor covers the anterior third of the right vocal fold. In this way, the tumor is successively resected from its lateral attachment site so that it is mobile enough to also overlook the caudal part and then resected with an appropriate safety margin. Subsequently, marginal incisions are made supraglottically, subglottically and in the area of the anterior commissure. In the area of the anterior commissure, the tissue is unrepresentative or severely thermally altered. However, resection at this site shows no evidence of tumor. The tumor is then further developed dorsally. To do this, switch to the Kleinsasser B-tube. This time the resection extends to the vocal process, which is also partially removed. Here too, marginal sections are first taken from the resection margin, all of which prove to be free of tumor on frozen section histology. The remaining tumor parts on the arytenoid cartilage are then resected with an appropriate safety margin. The tube is repeatedly loaded onto the Kleinsasser B or C tube so that the tumor can also be resected medially in the area of the posterior commissure with an appropriate safety margin. In this way, tumor resection with partial removal of the right arytenoid cartilage is ultimately successful. The marginal incisions from this area also proved to be tumor-free on frozen section histology. In summary, an R0 resection can therefore be assumed. Finally, careful hemostasis by monopolar coagulation. Removal of the instruments without tooth damage and transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Transoral laser-surgical partial laryngeal resection for right cT2 glottic laryngeal carcinoma. All incisions were tumor-free on frozen section histology. Control panendoscopy in 8 weeks.","Transoral laser surgical tumor resection

It is a squamous cell carcinoma. The above-mentioned operation is now indicated.,"First pharyngoscopy to confirm extension: The exophytic tumor is seen, which extends from one tonsil lobe on the left to the other and also grows posteriorly towards the nasopharynx. Now transoral resection: The tumor is removed macroscopically on all sides with a safety margin of approx. 1.5 cm in healthy tissue. The entire tonsil lobe on the left, the entire palatal arch up to the hard palate or the beginning of the vomer and the entire tonsil lobe on the right as well as on the left side up to the base of the tongue are removed. The tumor is resected macroscopically on all sides in healthy tissue. Suture marking. This is followed in the middle of the palatal arch in the direction of the vomer by a marginal sample with mucosa and soft tissue. This is also thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. The tumor on the left caudal side, below the tonsil pole in the direction of the base of the tongue is not yet healthy, otherwise healthy on all sides, and the marginal sample is also healthy. Therefore, another extensive resection is performed in the area of the posterior palatal arch in the caudal region, the anterior palatal arch and parts of the base of the tongue. Subsequently, a marginal sample is taken from the area mentioned, which is thread-marked and sent for frozen section. No more tumor infiltrates here. Thus overall R0 status. This is followed by repositioning for neck dissection and defect coverage using a radial flap. Sterile covering of all areas. Start with neck dissection on both sides (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Start with neck dissection on the right side: mark a curved skin incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side, then dissect through the subcutaneous tissue, initially sparing the external jugular vein, exposing the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Finding the digastric muscle and following it to the mastoid. Visualization of the hypoglossal nerve. Then locate the accessorius nerve, which is spared. Finally, the internal jugular vein and the facial vein are dissected in their course. Now develop the lateral neck preparation from level IIb to IV while sparing the cervical plexus and exposing the carotid artery and vagus nerve. All structures can be spared. Now follow the cervical artery and develop the anterior neck preparation while sparing all vascular structures. Finally, careful hemostasis and wound irrigation and then proceed to the creation of a plastic tracheostomy. Marking of a skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue, ligation of two larger veins matching the anterior jugular vein, then separation of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and undermining of the thyroid isthmus which is ligated on both sides. Now expose the anterior tracheal wall and incision in the 3rd cartilage interspace while sparing the cuff. Finally, creation of a classic Bjlörk flap and epithelialization of the tracheostoma with single-button sutures, which is completely tension-free. Now reintubation. Then proceed to neck dissection on the left side. In principle the same procedure as on the right side, exposing the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Trace the omohyoid muscle. Expose the glanular submandibular muscle which is retracted. Now expose the hypoglossal nerve and follow the digastric muscle. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and exposure of the accessory nerve, which is spared. Now also develop the lateral neck preparation from level IIb to IV. Then follow the cervical artery and develop the anterior neck preparation while sparing all neurovascular structures. Here too, hemostasis using bipolar coagulation and wound irrigation. We now move on to the microvascular anatomy on the right side of the neck. Elevation of the radialis flap from the left forearm: After measuring the defect enorally, the flap is 13 cm long and a maximum width of 6 cm. The flap is first incised from the ulnar side. A curved incision is then made in the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the superficial venous system. Subfascial elevation of the flap from the ulnar side. Exposure of the vascular pedicle. Exposure distal to the radial artery. This is clamped. Lift the flap subfascially from the radial side. The flap remains at 100% for 10-15 minutes after the radial artery has been clamped. The radial artery is then removed. Treatment with puncture ligatures 4.0 Prolene. Then lift the flap along the pedicle. Outgoing smaller vessels are coagulated bipolar or treated with clips. Lift the flap with the vascular pedicle and superficial venous system into the crook of the elbow. A double outlet of the cephalic vein, a connection to the deep venous system, can be visualized here. After clamping, the interosseous artery can also be removed. Flap perfusion is always 100%. No suitable confluence can be visualized in the area of the radial vein, several smaller vessels, some of which are less than 1 mm. The flap is then removed, the artery is clamped and sutured with 6.0 Vascufil above and below the inner surface. The veins are ligated. The flap is flushed with heparin. Then lift a piece of full-thickness skin of the appropriate size for the defect from the groin area on the right. After mobilizing the skin, the groin is closed in layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. The skin is successively worked into the defect. Cranial primary wound closure without tension. Dressing with hydrogel/Mepilex. Over this, cloud dressing and wrapping in absorbent cotton. A Cramer splint and loose wrapping in an elastic bandage is applied on top. Hand always well supplied with blood. Saturation at 100%. Good capillary pulse. Application to the hand. Now creation of a two transverse finger wide tunnel from the pharynx on the right into the soft tissues of the neck. Insertion of the flap into the defect. Insertion of the pedicle into the right side of the neck. Successive incorporation of the flap with 3.0 Vicryl single button sutures with low tension. The entire palatal arch area can be covered. In the area of the tonsillar lobe on the left, a portion of the defect in the caudal area of the pharyngeal wall remains uncovered by the flap while the pharyngeal wall is still very well preserved. Tension-free situs. Subsequent vascular anastomosis. Conditioning of the radial artery and the superior thyroid artery. Suture with 8.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. Conditioning of two venous outlets from the facial artery. These are each anastomized with 2.5 mm couplers after vessel conditioning. After opening the clamp, good venous return in each case. Smear phenomenon positive in each case. Extensive hemostasis again in both sides of the neck. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain on the left and a guided Redon drain on the right. Finally, insertion of a 9 mm tracheostomy tube, which is fixed with sutures. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue intraoperative antibiotics for 2-3 days with Unacid. Heparin perfusor, which was started intraoperatively at 500 I.U./hour, should be continued postoperatively for 5 days. Monitor the flap according to the scheme using clinical checks and Doppler checks. For this purpose, mark the suture on the right side of the neck in the area of the stalk. Feeding via inserted PEG tube. After approx. 10 days, gruel swallowing and, if necessary, food build-up. Overall cT2-3 palatal arch/oropharyngeal carcinoma on both sides. Defect covered by radial flap. Clinically no clear indication of lymph node metastases, but metastases on both sides possible with enlarged lymph nodes.

Had resisted therapy in the further course. Now in 2012, the patient presented again in an emergency when intubation by the emergency physician was impossible due to asphyxia. A new panendoscopy was performed as part of the retracheotomy. This revealed an extensive laryngeal carcinoma, which was confirmed by biopsy to be a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The CT scan performed showed a cT4a laryngeal carcinoma on the right side with extensive destruction of the thyroid cartilage and extensive extralaryngeal growth, but no evidence of infiltration of vascular or mediastinal structures. There was also no evidence of distant metastasis, which is why the indication for surgical treatment was given, given the patient's desire for treatment.","First, after intubation via the existing tracheostoma, perform a pharyngo-/laryngoscopy: enter with the small bore tube under dental protection after inspecting the inconspicuous oral vestibule. An inconspicuous oral cavity including the floor of the mouth, tongue and soft palate is revealed. The oropharynx shows inconspicuous tonsil regions and posterior pharyngeal wall. The vallecula appears submucosally bulging, but there is still no exophytic tumor growth. The epiglottis is extremely displaced, there is an extensive, almost completely submucosal tumor that completely consumes the larynx. Careful inspection. The posterior wall of the hypopharynx and the lateral wall, including the piriform sinus, are completely free on the left, as is the free esophageal entrance; parts of the lateral wall of the hypopharynx are also free on the right. The piriform sinus is fixed and infiltrated by the tumor. Extensive extralaryngeal growth is palpated on the right side. Flexible esophagogastroscopy is now performed: an extensive scar is seen in the case of extensive gastrointestinal bleeding in 2010. With normal conditions in the gastric region and excellent diaphanoscopy, the stomach is now punctured without any problems and the PEG tube is inserted using the thread pull-through method without any problems. Inconspicuous esophagus on reflection. The patient is now repositioned. First of all, an apron flap is created by cutting around the old tracheostoma over a large area. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Creation of the apron flap taking into account the platysma salt layer. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides. The extralaryngeal tumor growth can now be easily palpated. The thyroid gland is clearly enlarged but symmetrical and soft, and the infrahyoid muscles are not infiltrated. Initially start by detaching the tumorous process from the left side. To do this, first perform the neck dissection in the anterior region. Expose the submandibular gland. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Exposure and preservation of the facial vein. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure and preservation of the extremely strong superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the common carotid artery. The neck preparation is turned medially towards the tumor. This is followed by exposure of the thyroid cartilage horn. Release and ligation of the laryngeal bundle. Careful dissection and release of the piriform sinus. Exposure and release of the hyoid. This is clearly free on the left side. Dissection of the infrahyoid musculature. Dissection of the trachea on the left side. Left-sided resection of the thyroid isthmus. The pharynx is now entered between the thyroid cartilage and the hyoid, in the area of the left-sided vallecula, transition to the pharyngeal side wall. Free conditions here after inspection. Gradually widen the pharyngotomy and widen the mucosal incision. For a better overview, the lingual artery must be ligated and removed. It can now be seen that the epiglottis is also free on the left side. The vallecula is clearly tumor-free. Therefore, the mucosal incision is now extended along the aryepiglottic fold on the left and in the area of the vallecula. Successive release of the tumor. On the right side, the tumor appears to have at least contact with the hyoid, so the lateral right third is now resected. Now perform a parallel resection of the cervical sheath on the right side. The procedure is basically the same as on the opposite side. Expose the submandibular gland. Expose the digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. The facial vein moves towards the tumor and is removed after ligation. Careful dissection and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve. The superior thyroid artery also runs into the tumor conglomerate and is also removed after ligation. Exposure of the common carotid artery. Exposure of the prevertebral fascia. Medial and caudal, also relatively right-sided resection of the thyroid isthmus. The thyroid isthmus is preserved on the specimen, but is not infiltrated macroscopically. The former tracheostoma is now completely excised. This is also inflammatory in depth, but without evidence of direct tumor infiltration. Now, after complete mobilization and exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, the tumour is resected. Circumscribed right paralaryngeal open tumor, but with clear and safe separation from the soft tissue of the neck. Otherwise, regular soft tissue remains on all sides of the tumor. Complete resection of the tumor with resection of the right-sided piriform sinus. The mucosa of the posterior wall can be completely preserved, also free esophageal entrance, no postcricoid growth. A small, exophytic, ulcerated area can be seen in the area of the right-sided piriform sinus, otherwise completely submucosal tumor. Removal of the trachea, taking the tracheostoma with it, and removal of the tumor macroscopically clearly in sano. The mucosal margin samples are now imaged circularly. Moderate grade dysplasia, but no higher grade dysplasia or CIS was diagnosed in the postcricoid region and the right-sided hypopharynx. Completely free conditions on the left side. Therefore, no further resections were performed here. After inspection, the subglottic area was clear and wide. A Provox prosthesis is now fitted. Due to the inflammatory changes in the tracheostoma, conditions were somewhat more difficult, also due to the deep-seated trachea. The Provox prosthesis is inserted as cranially as possible. This is technically successful without any problems. The neck dissection is then completed. In principle exactly the same procedure. First on the left side. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Release the accessorius triangle while carefully protecting the nerve. Release of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Isolated ligation of a strong inflow to the thoracic duct. This can be easily visualized. Absolutely dry conditions here and no further measures. Complete exposure of the internal jugular vein beforehand. Careful wound inspection and turning to the opposite side. Level VI was removed en bloc with the preparation. Same procedure on the right side. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Release of V a with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Ligation of the transverse cervical artery and coagulation of the right occipital artery. Careful wound inspection and hemostasis. Careful, two-layer pharyngeal suture with 3.0 mucosal suture, submucosal and inverting. Finally, good invasion of the 1st pharyngeal suture and tight conditions. Good mucosal conditions with preserved submucosal tissue. Mobilization of the detached thyroid gland is now performed, allowing a wide and large soft tissue mantle to be created on the pharyngeal tube. Suturing with 2.0 Vicryl. Final wound inspection. Insertion of a 10 Redon drain and cervical two-layer wound closure. Insertion of the tracheostoma. Clearly more difficult conditions here. Due to the inflammatory conditions in the area of the trachea and the relatively short tracheal stump, there is a slight tilting of the Provox prosthesis. Otherwise intact conditions on all sides. At the end of the operation, reintubation to a 10 mm tracheoflex cannula without any problems. Finally, also at the patient's request, removal of a left buccal atheroma, which has been present for many years. Also several atheroma-specific lesions distributed over the head. A curved skin incision is now made in the case of disturbing findings on the left buccal side. Cut through the skin. Excision of the directly subcutaneous mass, macroscopically and clinically clearly corresponding to an atheroma. Careful release strictly at the atheroma capsule. Therefore, protect the surrounding soft tissue. Meticulous hemostasis followed by careful, two-layer wound closure and completion of the procedure at this point without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperatively R0-resected cT4a cN2b glottic laryngeal carcinoma. Please perform a postoperative X-ray gruel swallow on the 9th postoperative day if the wound conditions are normal. In the area of the trachea, first wait for the wound to heal completely and then assess the Provox prosthesis.","Laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy and reconstruction, Neck dissection

The above-mentioned operation was therefore indicated. The patient was also informed in detail about defect coverage using a microvascular pedicled flap.,"First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The exophytic tumor is seen in the area of the hypopharyngeal side wall, passing over the anterior hypopharyngeal wall on the left to the postcricoid region and occupying it almost completely. The tumor also invades the left laryngeal skeleton via the arytenoid fold, thus confirming the indication for surgery. The patient is now repositioned: First neck dissection and tumor resection: creation of an apron flap in typical subplatysmal fashion. Then neck dissection on the right side: exposure of the digastric and omohyoid muscles. Dissection of the lymph node fat packet from the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein, common carotid artery. Internal carotid artery, external. Exposure of vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. Successive removal of the lymph nodes and fatty tissue from levels II-V, also by preserving branches of the cervical plexus. Neck dissection on the left side: This shows a conglomerate of cranial lymph nodes in level II, showing the omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. The latter has grown together with the conglomerate and is also resected. Underlying the hypoglossal nerve. This runs through the middle of the lymph node conglomerate and must also be resected. Parts of the sternocleidomastoid muscle must also be resected in the cranial area. The internal jugular vein is also involved in the tumor process and must also be resected. It is exposed caudally and ligated twice. The lymph node conglomerate along the carotid artery and vagus nerve is then removed. Here, the mass must be dissected with some effort, particularly in the area of the bifurcation, but there is no tumor infiltration. Cranial exposure of the internal jugular vein and removal and double ligation of the vein also cranially in the vicinity of the jugular foramen. The accessorius nerve can be exposed and preserved here. Overall, level II-V evacuation as part of radical neck dissection. Subsequent tumor resection: First remove the level VI package, this is sent separately for histology. Then separation of the infrahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone. Subsequently detachment of the suprahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone. Exposure of the right superior cornu and separation of the piriform sinus. Separate the thyroid gland caudally and strike it caudo-laterally on both sides. On the left, the superior cornu is not released as it is located close to the tumor. Then enter the pharyngeal space above the level of the hyoid bone. Expose the tumor. The tumor is successively removed with a safety margin of at least 1.5 mm on all sides. This initially results in a partial pharyngectomy with laryngectomy. Laryngeal skeleton is released caudally with attached tumor and pharyngeal tube. Caudal creation of a tracheotomy and reintubation. Caudal suture of the trachea. The tumor preparation is then detached by cutting around a cranial tongue. The tumor specimen is marked with a suture. In addition, a caudal margin sample is taken and sent for frozen section. Unfortunately, carcinoma in situ infiltrate can still be seen in the left lateral, cranial and caudal tumor specimen. There is also carcinoma in situs in the area of the caudal margin sample. Therefore, margin samples are necessary at several locations. Extensive margin samples are taken approx. 1 cm wide caudally, laterally on the left and cranially. These are marked remote from the tumor and on the lateral suture. No more tumor infiltrates are visible here during the assessment. This ultimately results in a subtotal pharyngectomy. Due to the situation, defect coverage with a microvascular radial flap is now indicated. Provox prosthesis is not possible or sensible due to the overall situation and the proximity of the end of the defect to the potential Provox prosthesis site. However, a left myotomy has already been performed as part of the operation. The muscles of the cricopharyngeal muscle on the left side were completely severed over a length of 3-4 cm. Careful attention was paid to intact mucosa. This is followed by careful hemostasis and irrigation of the entire wound area. Now remove the left forearm flap: Marking of the defect size including skin monitor. Defect size 1.5 x 10 cm. Cut around the flap, initially ulnarly. Subsequently, dissection of the skin with some attached subcutaneous tissue and placement of a subcutaneous incision for skin monitoring. Extend the incision cranially to the crook of the elbow. Release of the skin monitor with subcutaneous tissue and superficial venous system. Release of the flap from radial, subfascial. Distal exposure of the radial artery. This is clamped for several times, here no changes in saturation, which is always 97-100 %. Subsequently, the radial artery is removed and treated cranially and caudally with 4-0 prolene sutures as a puncture. Successive elevation of the flap with deep pedicle, which was previously exposed under the brachioradialis muscle. Outgoing vessels are bipolarly coagulated and treated with clips. Exposure of a radial vein and cephalic vein through the antecubital fossa, which offers two outlets. Removal of the flap. The veins are ligated and the artery is treated with 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Spray the flap with heparin solution. Then successive insertion of the flap into the defect in the pharyngeal area. Incision of the skin at the esophageal entrance to improve the massage through the upper esophagus. Successive suturing of the flap with 3-0 or 4-0 Vicryl single-button sutures. This results in tension-free complete closure of the defect. The stalk is inserted cranially into the right side of the neck. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery. Anastomosis with the conditioned radial artery using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. V. radialis is anastomosed with an outlet from the A. facialis using a 2-0 coupler. Here too, good venous return after opening the clamp, positive smear phenomenon. A further vein which is branching off from the internal jugular vein is anastomosed with a branch from the cephalic vein, also using a 2.5 coupler. Again, after opening the clamp, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The remaining outlet from the cephalic vein is tilted close to the outlet. This is followed by irrigation of the entire wound area. Careful hemostasis. A Redon drain is inserted into each side of the neck on the right. The thyroid gland is adapted above the caudal part of the flap using 3-0 Vicryl sutures. Likewise the remaining infrahyoid muscles. Skin closure with suturing of the apron flap to the trachea and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. The skin monitor is sutured in place without tension via a small median incision. Good aspect. Tracheal cannula size 10 is placed and fixed with sutures. Closure of the forearm defect: approx. 0.7-0.8 mm thick split skin is removed from the thigh using the dermatome in a typical manner. The cranial parts of the wound on the forearm are sutured in layers. The defect is closed with the split skin, which is successively incorporated while protecting vascular and neuronal structures. Finally, a hydrogel-Mepilex dressing is applied and a loose compress bandage is placed over it and fixed with absorbent cotton. The arm is adjusted to a functional position on a Cramer splint and fixed with a flexible bandage. Loosening of the arm. Arm always well supplied with blood. Saturation between 95 and 100 %. The superficial wound area on the thigh is covered with a hydrocolloid dressing. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. The antibiotic treatment that was started intraoperatively should be continued with Unacid for 2-3 days. Heparin perfusor with 500 E/h, which was started intraoperatively, should be continued postoperatively for at least 5 days. Flap control for at least 5 days according to the scheme via Doppler control and control of the skin monitor. Leave the intraoperatively inserted gastric tube in place, feed via the previously inserted PEG tube for at least 10 days, then swallow porridge and, if necessary, build up the diet. Overall cT4a hypopharyngeal carcinoma with invasion of the left laryngeal skeleton. Under subtotal pharyngectomy, defect coverage by means of microvascularly pedicled radial flap from the left side necessary. Overall, given the size of the tumor, postoperative free chemotherapy is indicated.","Resection, Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial)

Removal of the left radial lobe (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders 9x7 cm on the distal forearm proximal to the retinaculum floxorom with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Cutaneous and subcutaneous incision starting proximally, identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. The cephalic vein is well developed on this side. There are now already 2 large veins to the anastomosis in the cubital fossa. Now identify the external ramus of the radial nerve and leave the peritendineum of the tendon of the brachioradialis muscle and incise down to the forearm fascia, incise the fascia and then lift the flap fascially to the end of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendon and to spare the ulnar artery. The ulnar artery is spared, the radial artery is identified distally, palpated and clamped. Clamping of the vessels with the HDS clamp, after 5 minutes under good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry on the palate, the vessels are removed with subsequent Ethibond 0 ligation. The successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the flexor pollicis longus muscle was performed. Larger perforators were treated with clips. The ulnar, brachial and radial arteries are identified proximally. The flap is then placed on the radial artery and 2 large veins in the cubital fossa are also placed, which are suitable for anastomosis. The flap is irrigated with heparin. Regular situation. The flap is now transferred for suturing and the arm is closed proximally in 2 layers with 4-0 Vicryl and 5-0 Ethilon. Distally, the resulting defect is sutured using split skin with 5-0 Ethilon. The previously fitted forearm splint is then applied and flap elevation is completed without complications. Tumor resection by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Insertion of the McIvor oral retractor with the small spatula and adjustment of the site. This shows a coarse, ulcerated mass localized to the left tonsil lobe. Submucosally, the mass extends just above the cranial tonsil pole. The resection margins are determined in the presence of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Successive tumour resection after mobilization of the upper tumour pole under constant palpatory control. The resection is performed in healthy muscle tissue. Lateral parapharyngeal fat is visualized. Bleeding is stopped with the bipolar coagulation forceps. After cutting around the caudal pole of the tonsil, leaving a strip of the base of the tongue on the tumor resectate, the sutures are marked on all 4 quadrants. The resectate is sent in its entirety on cork for a frozen section histopathological examination. After 1 hour, the feedback is received that the tumor has been resected R0. All tumor margins are free. Subtle hemostasis in the tumor bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Neck dissection is performed on the left side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: After infiltration with local anesthetic containing adrenaline, the corresponding arcuate skin incision is made. Sharp dissection through the cutis and subcutis with exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The large, easily displaceable metastasis is located immediately adjacent to this. This is first exposed on all sides, whereby the neck dissection specimen is successively dissected along the omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle with parts of the caudal parotid gland and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Open the vascular nerve sheath caudally and dissect cranially. Expose the internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery as well as the vagus nerve in between, which can be spared until the end. Subsequently, successive cranial dissection with successive detachment of the large metastasis from the internal jugular vein, which is ultimately also successful in a healthy layer. The digastric muscle is followed ventrally from its anterior belly via its tendon to the posterior belly and the specimen is thus also dissected laterally. The hypoglossal nerve is preserved. Finally, the metastasis with the caudal parts of the parotid gland is completely detached from the vascular nerve sheath. The accessory nerve can also be preserved intact from region II. The neck dissection is then completed with resection of regions II to V so that the neck dissection specimen can be resected en bloc together with the large metastasis. The submandibular gland is then removed and region I cleared. In addition to the lingual nerve, the enoral defect that will later be used for the flap can also be seen here. Neck dissection on the right by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and PJ: Skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Separation of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the platysma and transection of the platysma. Snaring of the platysma and subplatysmal flap preparation. Ligation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the auricular nerve and protection of the nerve. Now dissection in depth along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Expose the posterior digastric venter muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Insertion of blunt retractors and exposure of the cervical vascular nerve sheath. This is successively freed from the neck preparation. Now remove the neck preparation after visualization and release of the accessorius nerve from cranial to caudal, taking level II a, II b, III, IV and V. Insertion of a 10 Redon drain. Subtle hemostasis using bipolar coagulation forceps. Irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer and two-layer wound closure on the right side of the neck. Now the radialis graft is inserted by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: looping the cranial flap end cervically with a clamp and pulling through the opening. Insertion of the graft into the tumor resection box. Flap fixation and suturing of the flap in single button sutures in the usual manner without complications. Inspection shows good closure with a well-fitting graft. Anastomoses through <CLINICIAN_NAME>: After appropriate suturing of the flap enorally, the stalk is passed outwards and fixed with 2 retaining sutures. The arterial anastomosis is made to the superior thyroid artery on the left side. Venous drainage is then ensured by the two existing veins, which are connected to the internal jugular vein in an end-to-side manner. The tracheotomy is then created by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: horizontal skin incision just below the cricoid over 2 cm. Separation of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection into the fatty tissue and exposure of the infralaryngeal musculature, which is split in the middle and the thyroid isthmus is exposed. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus. Bipolar coagulation and transection with the scissors. Identification of the anterior tracheal wall and entry into the 2nd and 3rd intertracheal ring space. Incision of the tracheostoma in the usual manner using epithelializing single-button sutures.

CT clearly shows thyroid cartilage infiltration by the tumor. Therefore, the above mentioned surgery is indicated.","<CLINICIAN_NAME>: Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesiologist, then first of all, insertion of the small bore tube and examination of the tumor. It can be seen that the tumor already starts at the lower tonsil pole on the right side and extends along the hypopharyngeal side wall and posterior wall into the piriform sinus, filling it completely and infiltrating the larynx laterally. Then sterile washing and draping and creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Start with the neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. Then locate the accessorius nerve and clear levels II b, III, IV and V while sparing the plexus branches. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and evacuation of the medial upper neck preparation. Then evacuation of the neck level VI and separate insertion of the neck level VI. Then turn to the opposite side and perform the neck dissection on the left side in the same way. Several large, coarse metastases are visible on the right side. On the left side only unspecifically enlarged lymph nodes. Then detachment of the cervical vascular sheath from the tumor and from the larynx. Detachment of the tumor from the spinal column. This is achieved without any problems using blunt dissection. Perform a median pharyngotomy at the level of the epiglottis. Then grasp the epiglottis and pull the epiglottis through the pharyngotomy. Carefully incise the mucosa along the aryepiglottic fold, first on the left side, then on the right side, observing the tumor margins. Release the laryngeal preparation in the posterior part. Then perform the tracheotomy. Enter the trachea between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage. The patient has had a history of thyroidectomy, so that no thyroid gland was present. Suturing of the lower skin to the trachea. Then placement of a feeding tube under visualization. Locate the esophagus and remove the laryngeal specimen and the tumor specimen. An approx. 3 cm wide strip of mucosa remains in the upper part of the pharynx, but this becomes significantly smaller in the lower area, so that primary closure of the pharynx does not appear possible and the decision is therefore made to sew in a radialis graft in any case. In the meantime, suture marks are placed on the tumor specimen and the entire specimen is guided to the frozen section. Unfortunately, resection is necessary in 2 places, once in the area of the epiglottis and then at the caudal edge of the deposit. This is done by taking a resection specimen, which goes to the final histology and then new frozen sections. Both new frozen sections are tumor-free, so that an R0 situation can be confirmed intraoperatively. Therefore, lifting of the radialis graft and insertion of the graft as well as anastomosis of the vessels by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Parallel removal of the split skin from the right thigh and suturing of the split skin to the forearm. Application of a Mepilex dressing. Fixation of the Mepilex dressing with Mersilene sutures. Application of a Kramer splint. Completion of the operation without complications. <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Now removal of the forearm flap from the left forearm: After measuring the defect, the flap dimensions are 13 to 14 cm in length and at least 8 to 9 cm in width. Record the flap with a skin monitor on the left forearm. Then first cut around the flap ulnarly. Dissect the skin, leaving subcutaneous tissue in the area of the planned subcutaneous bridge to the skin monitor, which is cut around. Continue the incision into the crook of the elbow. The flap is lifted ulnarly subfascially while preserving the ulnar artery. Then, after locating the superficial venous system and including it in the flap pedicle, lift the flap subfascially from the radial side. Locate the vascular pedicle under the brachioradialis muscle and follow it to the elbow. Locate the radial artery caudally and clamp. First lift the flap from the radial subfascial. Subsequently, the radial artery is removed. This is treated distally and proximally with 4-0 Prolene sutures. Lift the flap subfascially along the flap pedicle, taking the subcutaneous tissue with it to the skin monitor. Individual vessels are bipolarly coagulated or clipped. In the antecubital region, visualization of the radial artery of the confluence with the brachial artery and the outlet of the interosseous artery. Subsequent exposure of the cephalic vein, which splits into 2 vein ends, with connection to the deep vein system. The radial artery splits into smaller veins in the area of the confluence, which is not suitable for anastomosis and is separated and supplied with a clip. Another caudal vein, which arises from the subcutaneous tissue of the skin monitor, can initially be retained. The flap is removed. Veins are ligated. The artery is treated with 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Flush the flap with heparin solution. Subsequent insertion of the flap: First myotomy laterally to facilitate passage of food later. Subsequent suturing of the flap successively with Vicryl 3-0 single button sutures to the remaining mucosal bridge in the case of a subtotal pharyngeal defect. Defect extends to the palatal arch in the area of the uvula. Flap suturing is successful at all points without tension. Partial duplication of the suture to secure it. Subsequent conditioning of the vessels. The radial artery is anastomosed with the lingual artery using 8-0 single Ethilon button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow and good venous return. An outlet of the cephalic vein is then conditioned and anastomosed with the facial vein using a 3.0 coupler. Here too, after opening the clamp, good venous flow. Positive smear phenomenon. The other end is anastomosed with the external jugular vein using a 2.5 mm coupler; here too, good flow conditions after opening the clamp. Positive smear phenomenon. Then careful hemostasis. Irrigation of the entire wound area. Repositioning of the apron flap. Suture the apron flap to the trachea without tension. The skin monitor is integrated into the skin on the right side with a right-sided vascular connection. Redon drains were inserted on both sides, guided on the right. Finally, insertion of a size 10 tracheal cannula, which is fixed with sutures. The site for Doppler control is marked on the right side in the area of the external jugular vein. The procedure is completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics for 2 to 3 days, which were started intraoperatively with clindamycin. Feeding via the PEG tube for at least 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Provox was not applied intraoperatively due to the flap situation and can still be applied at intervals. Please check the flap via skin monitor and Doppler sonography according to the scheme. Continue heparin perfusor 500 units per hour for 5 days. Overall cT4a cN2/4b oropharyngeal/hypopharyngeal/laryngeal carcinoma on the right. Postoperative radiochemotherapy should certainly be discussed.","Pharyngectomy, Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

Pre-insufflation into the stomach. After spontaneous diaphanoscopy, placement of a PEG tube with a thread pull-through method in the typical manner, no complications. The patient received 3 g Unacid i.v. perioperatively. Subsequently, infiltration of the subsequent apron flap incision with local anesthetic containing adrenaline. Sterile washing and draping. Marking and incision of the apron flap, which is lifted subplatysmal to the hyoid bone and fixed cranially in the usual manner. Then start with the right side. After identifying and opening the cervical vascular nerve sheath, regions II to V are successively removed. All non-lymphatic structures of the accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve and vagus nerve are spared and preserved. After evacuation of levels II to V and skeletonization of the carotid artery, the supralaryngeal vascular nerve bundle is severed. The insertions of the pharyngeal muscles are then separated from the lateral thyroid cartilage and the piriform sinus is released. Prior to this, the right thyroid lobe is ligated in the area of the isthmus and dislocated to the side. This also exposes the upper trachea. Then transition to the opposite side. In principle, a similar procedure is carried out here with the same findings. After separation of the pharyngeal muscles from the thyroid cartilage, the left piriform sinus is not released. The hyoid is then detached from the suprahyoid musculature with exposure of the pre-epiglottic fat body and preparation of the mucosa on the lingual epiglottis surface up to the upper edge of the epiglottis, without opening the pharynx first. The tracheostoma is then created. For this purpose, the 3rd tracheal clasp is cut caudally and the caudal mucocutaneous anastomosis is created. The patient is then reintubated without any problems. The 3rd tracheal clasp is then incised in an H-shape and the cartilage clasps are sutured to the side. Then transition to laryngectomy. For this, the larynx is first removed caudally under the cricoid. A caudally pedicled mucosal flap is then prepared, which will seal the tracheal chimney upwards towards Hermann. Removal of a marginal incision from the remaining endolaryngeal mucosal tissue from the specimen, which proves to be tumor-free on frozen section histology. Then dissection on the back of the cricoid cartilage down to the level of the arytenoid cartilage. Here then entry into the hypopharynx. After extending the incision on both sides, the tumor on the left side is visible. This shows that the first incision was made somewhat close to the tumor, so that an additional strip of mucosa is removed. The incision is then made on the right side along the epiglottis, leaving out the piriform sinus. On the tumor-bearing side, the tumor is cut around with an appropriate macroscopic safety distance of 1-11/2 cm and then joined in the area of the upper epiglottis edge or vallecula during the incision so that the larynx can be removed together with the pharyngeal part. Subsequently, circular marginal incisions are made from the pharyngeal defect. Dysplasia that does not correspond to CIS is still found in the area of the left hypopharynx. Nevertheless, resections are performed on this side and a new frozen section histological examination of the margin is performed, which then proves to be free of tumor and dysplasia. The defect measures approximately 9 cm in length and 6 cm in width. <CLINICIAN_NAME> then lifts the corresponding radial lobe in this size. Then remove the radial forearm flap on the left (<CLINICIAN_NAME>/PJ): Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Draw the flap boundaries 10 x 6 cm in the distal forearm proximal to the retina colum flexorum with an S-shaped course. Cut proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein. Dissection of the vein distally and with integration into the radial flap graft edge. Identification of the external ramus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion while leaving the tissue of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Then incision down to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle, taking care to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar nerve. Now identify the distal radialis and clamp it with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes under good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry on the thumb, the vessels are removed with subsequent ointment thread ligation after the pedicle has already been detached from the base, namely from the pronator quadratus and flexus policis longus muscles. Bipolar coagulation of the outgoing perforators and treatment with vascular clips into the cubital fossa. Exposure and sparing of the radial nerve in the median side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the ulnar and brachial arteries. The median cubital vein and the cephalic vein are also included, so that there are now 2 veins for anastomosis and the radial artery with an appropriate diameter is also removed proximally and treated with a lateral ligature. Hemostasis, two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm and distal graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. The split skin was previously lifted by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Application of a wound dressing and forearm splint. Subsequent suturing of the caudally pedicled mucosal flap on the tracheal chimney according to Hermann. Subsequently, myotomy of the constricotr pharyngis muscle and implantation of the Provox-Riga voice prosthesis. After removal of the radial lobe graft, it is sutured into the defect with single button sutures. The vascular pedicle is guided to the left side. The vessels or the branches of the external carotid artery up to the facial artery are extremely weak in caliber with a strong radial artery. For this reason, the maxillary artery is shown close to the external carotid artery and, after cutting through the digastric muscle, is followed as far as possible to the cranial side. Once there, it is displaced caudally together with the external carotid artery under the dissected hypoglossal nerve and anastomosed with the radial artery, which has approximately the same diameter. After the arterial anastomosis, the two venous anastomoses are made in an end-to-side manner to the internal jugular vein. A Redond suction drain is then placed on both sides and a drainage flap on the left side. Folding down of the apron flap and multi-layer wound closure with subsequent completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis and reintubation of the patient onto a 10-gauge tracheostomy tube, which is fixed to the skin with 2 sutures. Sterile wound dressing. End of the operation, transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy and defect coverage with a microvascular anastomosed radial lobe graft from the left forearm with simultaneous primary voice rehabilitation by implantation of a Provox-Riga voice prosthesis and myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle due to a cT3 sinus piriformis carcinoma on the left side.","Total LE with partial pharyngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Provox prosthesis, PEG placement

Now look at the palatal arch, which is completely affected by the tumor from one tonsil to the other; the uvula is only attached to a small connective tissue bridge infiltrated by the tumor and is resected. The tumor is then resected starting at the right caudal tonsil pole with the ultrasonic knife. This continues to the opposite side, in principle removing the entire soft palate. The resection ends again at the lower left tonsil pole. The preparation is then marked with sutures, particularly in the middle section. The main specimen is also examined using frozen section histology and proves to be a tumor resected in sano, also in the middle section. The subsequent marginal sections taken from the surrounding mucosal or defect margins also all proved to be tumor-free. After measuring the defect, a radial lobe graft of about 11 cm in length and up to 6 cm in width was required. Radialis flap left through <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Marking of the landmarks after sterile abjoration and covering. Skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Locate the cephalic vein and dissect it distally. Finding the venous confluence in depth. Dissection of the 2 superficial veins into the antecubital fossa. Finding the pedicle between the bellies of the brachioradialis muscle and the flexor carpi radialis. The confluence is very small with a thickness of about 1 mm, but it can be preserved. Several other veins and connectors are also very small and delicate and can all be preserved. Exposure of the pedicle between the muscle bellies. Exposure of the radial artery at the junction between the brachial and ulnar arteries. Now mark the ulnar borders. The flap is lifted 12 x 6 or 3 cm wide. Ulnar incision and elevation of the myofascial flap up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis. Further incision and lifting of the graft with involvement of the cephalic vein. Protect the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. The ulnar artery on the opposite side can also be spared without any problems. Locate the radial artery distally and mark it with a silk thread. To prevent shearing, the fascia is sutured to the skin with 4-0 Vicryl. Now continue to successively dissect the flap, incorporating the pedicle. Lifting the flap and separating the vessels. Stitching over exposed tendons, removal of split skin. Suturing of split skin and two-layer wound closure in the usual manner. Creation of pie crusts and application of a sterile plaster cast. Neck dissection on the right by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Incision of the skin on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (2 transverse fingers below the mandible extending mediocaudally). Separation of the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Subplatysmal dissection anteriorly and posteriorly. Identification of the omohyoid muscle. Dissection along the muscle up to the level of the hyoid bone. Now also identify the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissect down to the deep cervical fascia. Care is taken to preserve the branches of the cervical plexus. Identification of the accessorius nerve and release of the nerve from the cranial neck preparation. The digastric muscle is exposed in depth. Dissection along the muscle up to the level of the hyoid bone. Now free the neck preparation from the cervical vascular nerve sheath while protecting the nervous and vascular structures. No abnormalities on dissection. Some slightly more prominent lymph nodes in region II. Now remove the neck specimen in the usual way from cranial to caudal while protecting the deep plexus branches and the accessorius nerve. Wound irrigation and insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain after extensive bipolar hemostasis. Two-layer wound closure after and completion of the right neck dissection without complications. Neck dissection on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Incision of the skin on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (2 transverse fingers below the mandible extending mediocaudally). Separation of the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Subplatysmal dissection anteriorly and posteriorly. Identification of the omohyoid muscle. Dissection along the muscle up to the level of the hyoid bone. Now also identify the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissect down to the deep cervical fascia. Care is taken to preserve the branches of the cervical plexus. Identification of the accessorius nerve and release of the nerve from the cranial neck preparation. The digastric muscle is exposed in depth. Dissection along the muscle up to the level of the hyoid bone. The neck preparation is then freed from the cervical vascular nerve sheath while sparing the nerve and vascular structures. A somewhat larger, metastasis-suspicious mass is located on the accessorius nerve, which can be easily separated from the nerve during preparation. No evidence of nerve infiltration. In region II, isolated somewhat more prominent lymph nodes. Now remove the neck specimen in the usual way from cranial to caudal, sparing the deep plexus branches and the accessorius nerve. Wound irrigation and insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain after extensive bipolar hemostasis. Two-layer wound closure after and completion of the left neck dissection without complications. After continuation of the operation and removal of the radial lobe graft, it is sutured in the palatal area and doubled in the middle section. The stalk is drained into the right side of the neck via a corridor. There the arterial anastomosis is made to the superior thyroid artery and the venous anastomosis in the form of a two-end-to-side anastomosis directly to the internal jugular vein. Finally, insertion of a Redon suction drain in both sides and an additional flap in the right side of the neck near the anastomosis. The patient was subsequently reintubated onto an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube without any problems. End of the operation. Handover of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Resection of a palatal carcinoma affecting the entire soft palate with microvascular reconstruction of a radial flap graft from the left forearm and defect coverage on the left forearm with split skin from the right thigh. In addition, selective neck dissection on both sides and creation of a plastic tracheostoma.","Resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy

Growing through the wall on CT, therefore flap coverage indicated. Size cT2-3. Patient was also informed about possible need for laryngectomy.","Induction of anesthesia and transoral intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. First laryngoscopy and pharyngoscopy: The exophytic tumor can be seen growing into the wall in the area of the pharyngoepiglottic plica transition or starting just below the lower tonsil pole and lying in the area of the lateral piriform sinus on the left. Free arytenoid fold. Transition medially to just on the posterior hypopharyngeal wall. Overall indication for flap coverage probably with preservation of the larynx. Now inject a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into the sides of the neck. Subsequent sterile draping of all areas including radial flap and thigh flap. Start with tracheostoma creation: Kocher's collar incision, slightly widened, which can later be widened into an apron flap. Subsequent dissection through subcutaneous tissue up to the anterior jugular vein, which is cut and ligated on both sides. The infrahyoid muscles are then pushed apart. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped, severed and then ligated using puncture ligatures. Then exposure of the trachea. Enter the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Incision into the trachea in the sense of a visor tracheotomy. Subsequent epithelialization in the caudal area. Re-intubation and insertion of a laryngectomy tube. Repositioning and sterile washing and draping. Creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Carry out the neck dissection on the right side. To do this, expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Then expose the cervical vascular sheath. It is clear that the jugular vein is infiltrated by a long metastasis. This is deposited in the area of level IV and also deposited at the top. Then the sternocleidomastoid muscle is deposited, which is also infiltrated in the midfield. The accessorius nerve and the cervical plexus must also be removed, so that ultimately only the hypoglossal nerve and the common carotid artery as well as the division of the internal and external arteries remain. The metastasis extends far dorsally into level V b and is completely removed with the neck block. Transition to the other side. The sternocleidomastoid muscle, submandibular gland, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle are also shown here. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and removal of the neck block II to V, sparing the plexus branches, sparing the accessorius nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. Now enter again with the Kleinsasser tube and inspect the tumor. An ulcer-like tumor can be seen, which begins below the tonsil lobe. Determine the entry limit into the pharynx. Then enter the pharynx from the left. Cut around the tumor with a safety margin of 1.5 cm. The specimen is placed on cork for frozen section. In the frozen section, all edges of the specimen are tumor-free and free of carcinoma in situ. Now measure the defect, 12 x 8 cm, and transition to the forearm. Draw a graft of the appropriate size and then palpate the radial artery and ulnar artery. Application of a 300 mmHg tourniquet and cutting of the graft and extension of the incision into the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the venous star in the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the cephalic vein, the basilic vein and the venous confluence. Dissection of the brachioradialis muscle. Dissection of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Exposure of the radial artery. Lifting of the graft from the tendon bed, protecting the ulnar artery and the tendons. Dissection of the pedicle up to the crook of the elbow. Then the stem is removed by <CLINICIAN_NAME> so that superficial and deep veins remain intact for connection. At the end, close the wound on the arm in the usual way. The tendon of the palmaris longus muscle must be removed in the distal area, as it stretches very far upwards and would probably pass through the split skin. Finally, a dorsal forearm splint was placed. In the meantime, <CLINICIAN_NAME> lifted the split skin from the right thigh in the usual way and then transplanted it to the left forearm. Subsequent suturing of the flap into the defect: The flap is sutured successively into the defect with 3-0 single Vicryl button sutures so that a tension-free closure is achieved and the pedicle can be passed to the opposite side for the vascular connections. Dissection of the facial vein and another small outlet directly between the facial and internal jugular veins. For the venous connections and dissection of the facial artery for the arterial anastomosis. Also removal of the submandibular gland for this purpose and for a better overview. Ductus wharton is ligated twice. Subsequent conditioning of the flap vessels and repeated heparin irrigation. The facial artery is sutured to the radial artery using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. Opening of the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. The confluent vein is anastomosed to the small outlet between the internal jugular vein and facial vein using a 2-0 coupler. After opening the clamp, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The larger of the cephalic branches is then anastomosed to the facial vein using a 3-0 coupler. After opening the clamp, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The other outlet had already been clipped when the flap was removed. Subsequent careful hemostasis, irrigation. Closure of the wound with epithelialization of the tracheostoma in layers in a typical manner with insertion of a Redon drain on the left and insertion of 2 flaps on the right. Re-intubation. Insertion of a tracheal tube, which is fixed with sutures. The procedure is then completed without complications. Patient transferred to intensive care unit for monitoring. Please continue antibiotics administered intraoperatively for one week. Upper body elevation. Control of the flap clinically or by Doppler at the marked or suture-fixed site anteriorly on the neck for 5 days according to the control scheme. Feeding via the previously inserted PEG tube for at least 10-12 days, then gruel swallow and, if necessary, diet build-up. Overall cT2-3 hypoharyngeal carcinoma with cN2c status. Postoperative presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Transcervical resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Flap coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

Subsequent adjustment of the findings at the left edge of the tongue using JENNING's mouth retractor. Inspection. This reveals an ulcerated area on the left edge of the tongue, slightly vulnerable to contact. Clearly indurated in depth and the extent is more likely to be that of a cT2 carcinoma of the left tongue margin. Marking of the incision with a monopolar needle. Successive bypassing of the mass with a satisfactory (inspection and palpation) safety margin. The mass is completely removed and then incised ex vivo. Clear evidence of malignancy. Four marginal samples are taken, which are sent for intraoperative frozen section examination together with the main tumor findings. The intraoperative frozen section examination revealed the diagnosis of a squamous cell carcinoma on the left edge of the tongue, which was completely removed in combination with the four tumor-free edge samples. Hemostasis there by means of bipolar coagulation. The operation was then continued with panendoscopy. Pharyngo- and laryngoscopy using a Kleinsasser C-tube revealed unremarkable findings with no evidence of a secondary malignancy. Flexible endoscopy of the oesophagus and stomach. Inconspicuous findings there, with no evidence of another malignancy in this area. Endoscope inversion and inspection of the esophagogastric junction. Inconspicuous findings there. Withdrawal of the endoscope. Repeated inspection of the oral cavity. Dry conditions there. Completion of the procedure without complications. Conclusion: ct2 cN0 in frozen section R0- resected squamous cell carcinoma of the left edge of the tongue, unremarkable panendoscopy. In the same session, a nasogastric feeding tube was inserted, through which the patient was to be fed for the next five days. Please wait for the final histology and prompt presentation of the patient to the tumor conference with the question of bilateral neck dissection in regions I to III and any necessary adjuvant therapy.

Intubation is extremely difficult as the patient is very difficult to adjust. Then intubation with the small bore tube, this is only possible with the D-tube and inspection of the hypopharynx and larynx. No abnormalities in the hypopharynx. Then adjustment of the glottic plane, this is only possible in the posterior two thirds, the anterior commissure cannot be adjusted even after the greatest possible effort. An exophytic mass can be seen in the area of the left vocal fold, which does not infiltrate the arytenoid cartilage, but extends right up to it. Now images with the NBI device and the Cellvizio device by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Rearrangement and injection of Ultracaine. Sterile washing and draping. Zigzag skin incision in the usual manner. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Push aside the prelaryngeal musculature. Formation of a perichondrium flap. Then sawing open the larynx in the median line. Opening of the larynx and inspection of the tumor region. As previously described, the tumor appears on the left vocal fold, extends to the arytenoid cartilage up to the anterior commissure, but does not infiltrate the opposite side. The tumor extends into the subglottic slope, but does not infiltrate the subglottic region very far down, at most 0.5 cm below the glottic level. Now detach the tumor from the inside of the thyroid cartilage, this can be done without any problems. Temporarily remove the tube and detach the tumor with scissors. The tumor specimen is thread-marked for final histology. A resection is then taken in the area of the pocket fold. Now marginal samples. The marginal samples show invasive carcinoma in the subglottic and arytenoid cartilage and carcinoma in situ in the area of the perichondrium on the inner side of the thyroid cartilage. In this case, the inside of the thyroid cartilage is removed with a diamond burr and resections are made of both the subglottic and the arytenoid cartilage. The tip of the arya falls off. Now close the larynx in the usual way after drilling holes and suturing the ligamentum conicum. Then overlap the perichondrium flap of the thyroid gland and the prelaryngeal musculature. A flap was sutured in beforehand. Then two-layer skin closure and before suturing, a tracheotomy was created between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage and a mucocutaneous anastomosis was formed.

Panendoscopy with sampling in domo <2016> was performed. Histologically, a poorly differentiated basaloid carcinoma was strongly P16 positive. In our preoperative tumor conference <2016>, it was decided to perform an enoral resection with neck dissection on the right side. The patient had sufficient time to ask questions preoperatively and was informed in detail about the procedure.","Transfer of the patient to the operating room and active implementation of the team time-out. Introductory consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Induction of intubation anesthesia by the colleagues. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon in the head reclination position. Inspection of the oropharynx begins with insertion of the McIvor mouth blocker. The tonsil on the right side is clearly prominent and hard to palpate. The tumor extends submucosally far into the soft palate on the right side. The medial tumor border is paramedian without crossing the midline. Caudally, the lower tonsil pole is tumor-free. There is no transition to the base of the tongue. Start tumor resection by marking the resection margins with the electric needle. Incision of the mucosa with the electric needle. Submucosal dissection with Cooper scissors. Smaller vessels are treated with the bipolar coagulation forceps. The tumor can be easily removed from the lateral oropharyngeal wall. The lower tonsil pole is free of tumor. Several marginal samples are taken for intraoperative frozen section diagnostics. It is shown that the cranial, medial and lateral margin samples of the tumor bed are still infiltrated by tumor. Decision to resect and resend the resected specimens for frozen section diagnostics. Here, too, tumor infiltration in the cranial and lateral areas of the tumor bed is noted. The findings are demonstrated to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Decision to perform a generous resection in the cranial part of the tumor with subtotal resection of the soft palate. Re-determination of several representative marginal samples. These are now tumor-free. An R0 situation can therefore be definitively assumed. After completion of the tumor resection, re-inspection of the wound area. The anterior palatal arch was completely resected. The posterior palatal arch was also completely used up. In addition, the tumor resection had to be performed cranially up to a subtotal resection of the soft palate. In the cranial part of the posterior palatal arch there is a defect approx. 1 x 1 cm to the nasopharynx. The lateral resection margin extends to the parapharyngeal fatty tissue. Due to the depth of the defect, a neck dissection on the right side is not performed in the same session in order to avoid an extensive defect. Hemostasis is performed using hydrogen and bipolar coagulation forceps. An attempt is made to reduce the defect with several adapting sutures. Bleeding is checked again at the end of the operation by raising the blood pressure. The wound bed is completely dry. During the frozen section break, a PEG tube was also inserted in the usual manner using the suture pull-through method. This was performed without complications. Conclusion: The enoral tumor resection of a cT2 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right side was performed today. Due to the size and depth of the defect in relation to the lateral pharyngeal wall with exposed parapharyngeal fatty tissue, simultaneous neck dissection is not performed. This should be planned at least 3 weeks apart. Depending on how well the wound has healed by granulation by then, defect coverage using vascular-free microvascular flap plasty should be discussed at the same time. This should be performed to prevent regurgitation, particularly with regard to the functional results in the case of a pronounced defect in the soft palate. Please wait for the final histology and present the case again in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Transoral tumor tonsillectomy

The deeply ulcerated tumor on the left edge of the tongue is seen, which extends into the base of the tongue and runs towards the floor of the mouth and the lingual box. First transoral tumor resection: insertion of a retractor, placement of a tongue tie suture. Tumor is removed on all sides with a safety margin of 1.5 to 2 cm. The posterior 2/3 of the tongue including the base of the tongue, floor of the mouth including the lingual nerve and parts of the submandibular and sublingual glands as well as the tonsil and glossotonsillar junction are removed. The specimen is marked with a thread and sent for frozen section. No infiltrates in all margins in the frozen section, thus R0 situation. The lingual artery was ligated during the transoral resection. Careful hemostasis. Repositioning for neck dissection and tracheostomy. First radical neck dissection on the right: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid and omohyoid muscles as well as the digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, external carotid artery. Large vessels can be dissected cranially from the lymph node conglomerate. Vagus nerve is exposed and preserved. Also the hypoglossal nerve. N. accessorius cannot be preserved and is resected together with the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Similarly, hardly any muscular structures can be preserved in the cranial part. The metastasis is infiltrated in muscular structures and in the cervical plexus. All branches infiltrated by the lymph node conglomerate are also resected, including the accessorius nerve. All deep cervical muscles and neck muscles are also resected, including the trapezius muscle. Caudally positive lymph nodes up to level V. Branches of the cervical plexus can be preserved in the caudal part. Evacuation level II to V. Due to the extensive lymph node metastasis, large areas of subcutaneous tissue below the nuchal and occipital skin as well as muscular tissue are removed. This is sent for frozen section. No more tumor infiltrates here. The submandibular gland is removed to create an enoral tunnel. The digastric and styloid muscles are severed. Remains of the lingual nerve are removed together with the gland. The lingual nerve had already fallen during the transoral tumor resection. The hypoglossal nerve can be preserved. Subsequent neck dissection on the left side: exposure of the sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid and digastric muscles. Exposure and preservation of the internal jugular vein, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery. Visualization of the superior thyroid artery and hypoglossal nerve, accessorius nerve and vagus nerve. Also visualization of the border cord. Evacuation level II to IV, followed by tracheostoma placement. Kocher's collar incision. Exposure of linea alba. Dissection of the infrahyoid musculature, visualization of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped off, severed and supplied by means of puncture ligatures. Subsequent exposure of the trachea. In the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space, enter the trachea and create a wide pedicled modified Björk flap. This is epithelized in the typical manner. Re-intubation and creation of a Woodbridge tube. Subsequent removal of the forearm graft from the left: After measuring the size, which is 10-11 x 6-7 cm, the flap is marked in the corresponding orientation for the course of the pedicle. The flap is then lifted from the ulnar subfascial side, followed by an incision in the crook of the elbow. Expose the superficial venous system and connect to the deep venous system. Then expose the flap radially and lift subfascially. The lateral cutaneous ramus of the antibrachial cutaneous nerve is exposed and preserved. Distal exposure of the radial artery and accompanying veins. Initially clamp for a few minutes. Exposure of the pedicle along the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure and connection of the deep superficial venous system. A cephalic vein with 2 outlets can be visualized in the crook of the elbow. The radial artery and a relatively well preserved confluence can also be visualized. Then dissection of the radial artery distally. Saturation always at 100 %. Successive elevation of the flap subfascially. Smaller vessels are supplied bipolar or with clips. Lift up to the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the radial artery and venous outlets. Deposition of the flap on 2 outlets from the cephalic vein, which are ligated, as well as deposition on an outlet corresponding to the confluence and ligation here. The radial artery is removed, which is treated with a 6-0 Vascufil suture. The interosseous artery is also severed. Treatment with clips. After previous clamping, the hand was also always well perfused with saturation of 99-100%. The flap is then removed and flushed with heparin solution. A piece of split skin 0.8 mm thick is removed from the thigh. This is then treated with a hydrogel dressing. Split skin is worked into the defect. Complete defect coverage.

Transnasal intubation by anesthesia colleagues. Sterile washing and draping. Start with transoral tumor resection. For this purpose, the tongue is snared and the tumor region is cut around with the monopolar needle in the area of the edge of the tongue to the base of the tongue. Then switch to the neck, as an overview is no longer guaranteed and the main tumor mass is located in the base of the tongue; instead, a skin incision is made in a transverse skin fold 3 transverse fingers below the lower jaw. Exposure of the platysma. Separation of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma cranially and caudally. Exposure of the submandibular gland, then the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the cervical vascular sheath and the accessorius nerve. Levels II to V a are then dissected out, sparing the plexus branches. The submandibular gland is detached and the digastric muscle is cut. The tumor clearly bulges in the area of the floor of the mouth and level II and can also be palpated here. Except for the external jugular vein, all neck vessels can be preserved. Now tanscervical tumor resection. To do this, grasp the tumor and subcircumcise it. Perform a pharyngotomy and enter the oral cavity. Further tumor resection using the pull-through technique. This allows the tumor to be completely resected en bloc. In the area of the glossotonsillar groove and in the area of the edge of the tongue, the tumor is very narrowly resected macroscopically, so a generous resection is performed here and a marginal sample is taken. Unfortunately, the resected frozen section still showed invasive carcinoma in the area of the edge of the tongue. Due to an organizational oversight, the marginal sample from the edge of the tongue that was taken after the resection was unfortunately not included in the frozen section. Therefore, another resection is performed here and a marginal sample is taken, which is ultimately tumor-free, final R0 situation. Repositioning for neck dissection on the right side and tracheotomy. Tracheotomy dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Marking of the landmarks (thyroid incisura, cricoid cartilage and jugulum). Mark the skin incision approximately 0.5 cm below the cricoid cartilage. Now start the incision and cut through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. This is carefully bipolarized. Insert two sharp retractors and dissect through the entire subcutaneous fatty tissue. Dissection on the prelaryngeal musculature. The linea alba is sought out and dissection continues in this area. The prelaryngeal musculature is released in the middle and pushed bluntly to both sides. Locate the capsule of the thyroid gland. Here ligation of a vein. The thyroid gland is ligated and the remaining ends are bipolarized. There is hemostasis. Exposure of the trachea. The trachea is now opened between the second and third tracheal clips. The incision is extended further to the right and left. A Björk flap is not applied. Suture in the Mersilene sutures. With the Kilian speculum, reintubation is performed without any problems, so that an 8 mm tube is now used for ventilation during the operation. Neck dissection on the right. Skin incision three transverse fingers below the lower jaw in a skin fold. Exposure of the platysma and dissection and preparation of the platysma cranially and caudally. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the submandibular gland, the omohyoid muscle and the digastric muscle. Clearing out the neck levels II a to V a, while sparing the plexus branches. All vessels, including the external jugular vein, can be preserved. Lifting the radial artery graft. First palpate the radial artery and mark the graft 12 x 8 cm. Then unwrap the forearm and further dissection in bloodlessness. Cut around the graft in the skin area. Incision up to the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the venous star in the antecubital fossa. Exposure of the superficial ramus, radial nerve, which divides into two main branches. Both main branches can be preserved. Exposure of the radial artery. Clamping and severing of the radial artery. Ligation. Detachment of the graft from the tendons and release of the pedicle in the usual manner. Deposition of the radialis graft with a superficial and a deep vein. Suturing of the graft first from the transoral side, starting at the soft palate, then along the floor of the mouth. The graft must be attached to the teeth and the alveolar ridge, as there is not enough mucosal remnant in the rest of the floor of the mouth. Further suturing from transcervically in the area of the pharynx and the vallecula and finally reconstruction of the tongue with the remainder of the transoral graft. Repositioning to perform the vascular anastomosis. The radial artery is connected to the facial artery and a vein from the graft to the facial vein and another vein to a branch of the facial vein. Good graft perfusion at the end. Insertion of 2 Redon drains, one on the left, one on the right and two-layer wound closure on both sides. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotic treatment for 24 hours postoperatively, then X-ray emesis on the 10th postoperative day and diet build-up if no fistula is present.

There is now an indication for tumor resection, neck dissection, tracheotomy and PEG placement. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation. Due to an unforeseen illness, the operation could not be performed as planned by the agreed representative of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. During a detailed preoperative discussion, both the patient and his <CLINICIAN_NAME> witnesses expressly agreed with <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> as the representative of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The patient was also offered the option of rescheduling the appointment several times. The patient now expressly wishes to have the operation performed by the two senior medical representatives mentioned above.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carrying out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Induction of anesthesia and nasotracheal intubation of the patient. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon. Insertion of the mouth guard. Entry with the small water tube and re-inspection of the tumor extension. If the findings are still transorally laser resectable, the decision is now made to resect the tumor with the CO2 laser as initially planned. Before this, however, oesophagogastroscopy and PEG placement are performed. Advancement of the endoscope under visualization and constant air insufflation into the stomach. This shows a typical gastric mucosal relief on all sides. Insertion of the PEG tube using the thread pull-through method in the typical manner. This is performed without any problems after a clear diaphanoscopy. Repositioning of the patient. Insertion of the mouth guard. Insertion of the spreading laryngoscope with the aid of support autoscopy. Endoscopic-assisted laser resection of the tumor. The tumor extensions extend from the caudal tonsil pole on the right side to the middle of the right-sided base of the tongue. From there, extension into the vallecula and microscopically also to the right-sided lingual epiglottis. Furthermore, extension over the glossotonsillar groove and the aryepiglottic fold. During the tumor resection, it is revealed that the tumor corresponds to a T3 finding due to its extensive submucosal growth and is larger than initially suspected. Dissection is considerably more difficult. There is heavy bleeding from the lingual artery in the area of the lateral pharyngeal wall. This can ultimately be stopped with two clips and a re-stitching. Due to the unexpected extent of the tumor, it cannot be resected using the en bloc resection technique, but rather using the piecemeal technique. As a result, a total of 14 marginal samples were meticulously removed. R0 status as part of the telephone frozen section announcement. Due to the extent of the tumor, the decision is made intraoperatively to forego neck dissection of the right side and to perform this in the interval. The patient is repositioned for neck dissection on the left side. Skin spray disinfection and infiltration anesthesia. Abjode the surgical site. Sterile draping. Mark the planned incision from the tip of the mastoid over the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in a curved line. Cut sharply through the cutis and subcutis. Exposure of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle as the caudal border. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and the posterior digastric venter muscle as the cranial border. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessorius nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Insertion of the retractors. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath in the sense of dissection of the internal jugular vein, the facial vein, the common carotid artery, the bifurcation and the external and internal carotid arteries. Exposure and protection of the vagus nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the vagus nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Development of the lateral neck preparation while sparing all plexus branches. Turning to the medial neck preparation. Exposure of the capsule of the submandibular gland. Exposure and protection of the hypoglossal nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Development of the medial neck preparation. Exposure and protection of the cervical nerve. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Subcutaneous suture with Vicryl 4.0 and skin suture with Ethilon 4.0. Application of a pressure bandage. Transition to protective tracheotomy. Due to the extensive resection area and the bleeding that has taken place in the area of the lingual artery on the right side, a protective tracheotomy is now indicated. Palpatory identification of the level of the cricoid cartilage. Signs of the planned incision in the form of an inverted T. Sharp transection of the cutis and subcutis.

This revealed at least a cT2 cN0 glottic carcinoma on the left side with submucosal extension of at least 1 cm to the subglottic and 1 ˝ cm to the supraglottic. ENT mirror examination shows aryfixation and vocal fold paresis on the left side. The tumor grows submucosally. B-scan sonography shows a cN0 neck status. An external CT neck/thorax revealed clinical findings without definite evidence of thyroid cartilage infiltration. Based on the medical history and clinical findings, the above-mentioned procedure was indicated. The patient had sufficient time and opportunity to ask questions about the operation and the procedure.","The patient is first taken to the operating theater, followed by active patient identification. Consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Carrying out the team time-out. Induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. Subsequent tracheobronchoscopy with 0° optics by the surgeon and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. This reveals the carcinoma described above, which describes the entire vocal fold with infiltration and encasement of the arytenoid cartilage on the left side and also grows into the anterior commissure. The vocal folds cannot be passed. Here is an attempt at anesthesia for transnasal intubation. This is initially unsuccessful due to the extension of the tumor into the subglottic and glottic areas. There is a drop in saturation. Only after considerable effort can the tube be inserted orotracheally by the anesthesia colleagues. The anesthesia is now deepened and a perioperative ultrasound is performed. As can also be seen on the CT scan, the tumor masses surround the arytenoid cartilage. For this reason and due to the panendoscopy findings described above with a minimum submucosal extension of 1 cm subglottically, <CLINICIAN_NAME> decided to perform a laryngectomy. CT and ultrasound also show a wide subglottic extension of the tumor towards the cricoid cartilage. Infiltration of the cricoid cartilage is also highly probable here. Now head positioning by the surgeon. Skin disinfection and infiltration anesthesia in the area of the planned skin incision with a total of 10 ml Ultracaine. Skin disinfection and sterile draping of the surgical area. Marking of the landmarks on both sides of the mandibular angle, mandibular branch, chin, incisura thyroidea, cricoid cartilage, jugulum, sternocleidomastoid and the mastoid as well as the skin incision in the sense of an apron flap. Now creation of an apron flap in a typical manner. Start of neck dissection on the left side through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Expose the sternocleidomastoid, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle and follow them. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, the hypoglossal nerve and release of the neck level II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches and the superior thyroid artery. There are 2 spherical, suspicious masses in the area mainly in level II and in level V below the plexus branches. The vagus nerve is visualized and spared. Also the cervical vascular sheath with the common carotid artery and the internal jugular vein in level IV. Extensive bipolar coagulation. No evidence of chyle fistula. Now exposing the hyoid bone. Release of the hyoid bone on the left side. Detachment of the cervical vascular sheath from the larynx and pharyngeal region. Detachment of the thyroid gland. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus using Pean clamps and ligation of the thyroid isthmus after severing it. Exposure of the superior laryngeal nerve, artery and vein. Dissection of the same and coagulation of the same. Now move to the opposite side to the right and perform right neck dissection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Identical procedure. Expose the sternocleidomastoid, the omohyoid, the submandibular gland and the digaster venter muscle posteriorly and anteriorly. Exposure of the nervus accessorius, hypoglossus, ansa and vagus and sparing of the same. Now clearing from level II to level V a, also sparing the plexus branches and the vagus nerve. Exposure of the common carotid artery. Release of the hyoid bone. Removal of the hyoid bone. Skeletonization of the thyroid cartilage on both sides. Exposure of the superior laryngeal nerve, artery and vein. Separation and bipolar coagulation of the same. Detachment of the cervical vascular sheath from the larynx and laryngeal region. Detachment of the thyroid gland and mobilization from the trachea. Detachment of the infrahyoid musculature and the laryngeal musculature. Perform a tracheotomy between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage and transfer intubation to a laryngectomy tube. Further skeletonization of the larynx on the right side. Release and removal of the piriform sinus. Same procedure on the left side. Enter the pharynx at the level of the epiglottis from the right side. Pull out the epiglottis through a pharyngotomy and incise the mucosa along the edge of the epiglottis up to the arytenoid region. Here, release the mucosa caudally from the arytenoid cartilage. Detachment and separation of the larynx. It can now be seen that the tumor completely surrounds the arytenoid cartilage and extends far into the subglottic region, infiltrating the cricoid cartilage. Overall growth of at least 1 ˝ cm from the glottic level to the subglottic level. Suture mark tracheal posterior wall caudal, lateral wall left, aryepiglottic fold on both sides and arytenoid cartilage dorsal left. Here the frozen section shows free on all sides, in the ary area dorsal left just in sano, here a cone draws close to the resection margin. Now create an oesophagotracheal fistula and insert a size 8 Provox prosthesis. Now perform the pharyngeal suture in three layers as usual, alternating between <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Now inspect the wound again. Irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer. Bipolar coagulation. Dry wound conditions. Insertion of a 10 Redon on both sides. Incision of the skin in the area of the stoma and two-layer wound closure. The operation is now completed without complications. The patient goes to the intensive care unit awake.

Because of this, the indication for resection of the tumor using TORS was given.","Introductory consultation with the anesthesiologist. Repeated panendoscopy and inspection of the tumor, which has not changed significantly compared to the previous findings from the panendoscopy a week ago. Insertion of the FK oral retractor and exposure of the tumor, which is successful without any problems. Insertion of the spandex blocker. Docking the robot and positioning the optics and the robot arms. Inserting the instruments, on the left the monopolar blades, on the right the Maryland clamp. Careful marking of the resection margins with the monopolar blade. Start of the resection from the parauvular side on the left, via the soft palate into the tonsil larynx. Care is taken to maintain a macroscopic safety margin of 0.5 cm in the entire area. The resection is then carried out via the tonsil lobe to the base of the tongue, where the tumor has infiltrated into the base of the tongue in a spherical shape. Therefore, resection of an area around the tumor from the base of the tongue. The resection extends forward from the soft palate into the glossotonsillar groove. An appropriate safety distance is also maintained here. Finally, the entire tumor preparation can be completely removed. Careful hemostasis. Removal of representative marginal samples from the area of the base of the tongue, the glossotonsillar groove and the anterior and posterior margin of the palate. All marginal samples are sent for frozen section diagnostics. The specimens of the palatal arch are thread-marked. The first frozen section inspection shows that both the marginal sample at the base of the tongue and the marginal sample in the glossotonsillar groove cannot be assessed due to thermal artifacts. For this reason, we again take marginal samples from the area of the glossotonsillar groove and the base of the tongue with the scissors. These are sent again for frozen section diagnostics. The marginal sample in the area of the glossotonsillar groove now shows infiltrations of the tumor. The marginal sample at the base of the tongue is assessed as tumor-free. An extensive resection is therefore performed in the area of the transition between the glossotonsillar groove and the base of the tongue, so that the resection extends to the bone of the ascending mandibular branch. These resections are sent for final histopathological assessment. Again, marginal samples are taken from the area of the glossotonsillar groove and the ascending mandible. Both marginal samples are now found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. After careful hemostasis, the instruments are removed. There is now a clearly enlarged velopharyngeal space, so that regurgitation of food cannot be ruled out with certainty. An attempt is therefore made to reconstruct the soft palate using the tissue of the remaining uvula. This is therefore first deepithelialized on the left side and sutured into the soft palate in three layers. Despite all this, a large velopharyngeal gap remains, so that the patient's swallowing function must be examined first. If there is massive regurgitation, treatment with a radial flap is necessary here. Due to this fact, neck dissection is not performed today for cN0 status. Depending on the clinical picture of swallowing function, this is performed either in combination with radial flap treatment or, if swallowing function is good, as a selective neck dissection. After another bleeding check, the patient is fitted with a nasogastric feeding tube and transferred via the recovery room to the in-house intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring.

Postoperatively, 90 ml of blood in the redon within 2 hours and a swollen neck on the left side. The wound was therefore opened in the recovery room and a large hematoma was relieved and there was significant post-operative bleeding, so the patient was taken to the operating room on an emergency basis.","Intubation by anesthesia colleagues and sterile draping. Subsequent reopening of the cutaneous and subcutaneous suture. Aspiration of the hematoma. Overall, there is diffuse bleeding in several places and a minimal vascular stump cranial to the paralaryngeal omohyoid muscle. This is ligated, but then breaks off; it can no longer be found during the dissection, but this site is extensively coagulated and no further bleeding occurs centrally. Other sites are also extensively bipolar coagulated. Overall, no large or medium-sized vessel can be identified that could have caused the bleeding. Repeated irrigation with Ringer's and finally also with H2O2, again no relevant bleeding, not even after raising the systolic blood pressure above 120 mmHg. Therefore, another Redon insertion, subcutaneous and skin sutures with 4.0 Vicryl and 4.0 Ethilon. Enorally dry conditions, therefore termination of the operation. Note: At the beginning of the operation, the patient again received 7 ampoules of Minirin and 1 platelet concentrate intraoperatively. He also received 1000 mg tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid 1000 mg please 3 times daily, BGA check in intensive care unit. Minirin 7 ampoules every 12 hours. Before the next administration, please check the PFA and platelet aggregation in the laboratory and consult the transfusion medicine colleagues again tomorrow.

This revealed the above-mentioned laryngeal carcinoma, CT morphology showed a clear thyroid cartilage infiltration on the right side, hence the indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","Induction of anesthesia and intubation by anesthesia colleagues. Injection, sterile washing and draping. Prior to this, a PEG was inserted using the thread pull-through method and diaphanoscopy was performed without any problems. Start with the skin incision in the usual manner and exposure of the platysma and creation of an apron flap by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Start with neck dissection on the right side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The sternocleidomastoid, digastric and omohyoid muscles, the submandibular gland and the cervical vascular sheath are shown here. Level II and III show large metastases, which are laboriously dissected from the internal jugular vein. There is no infiltration of the internal jugular vein. Change of surgeons and continuation of the operation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and release of the neck preparation IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Release of level VI. Turning to the opposite side. Here also visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. There are also several metastases here, also adherent to the internal jugular vein, but not infiltrating. These must also be carefully separated from the internal jugular vein. Release level VI and start free preparation of the larynx. First detach the cervical vascular sheath from the pharynx and larynx area. Detachment of the thyroid gland on the right side, then also on the left side. Release and removal of the hyoid bone with detachment of the infrahyal musculature. Skeletonization of the larynx, initially on the right side. Beginning with the release of the piriform sinus. This is only very partially possible here due to the tumor infiltration. Turning to the other side. Here the piriform sinus can be completely released from the thyroid cartilage. Entering the left paramedian pharynx. Disluxation of the epiglottis. A spatula must be inserted into the mouth for this. Incision of the mucosa along the edge of the epiglottis on the right side and inspection of the pharynx and the tumor region. It can be clearly seen that the tumor has infiltrated the aryepiglottic fold, the ary and the medial part of the piriform sinus on the right side. Therefore, a little more mucosa must be resected on the left side. Care is taken to ensure that a safety margin of 1 cm is maintained. Detachment of the mucosa from the postcricoid region and removal of the larynx below the cricoid cartilage by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Take marginal samples from all mucosal margins and send for frozen section. In the meantime, a Provox-VEGA is inserted by <CLINICIAN_NAME> in the usual manner. Then the attachments of the sternocleidomastoid muscle are reduced and a myotomy is performed on the esophageal sphincter on the left side. The esophagus is well and easily passable. Start with the pharyngeal suture from caudal to cranial and also from cranial to caudal under the incision of a ""T"". The frozen section findings are made in the meantime. Carcinoma infiltrates can still be found at the esophageal entrance on the right side, as well as at the base of the tongue on the right side. However, there is normal mucosa between the esophageal opening and the base of the tongue. The pharyngeal suture is reopened and resected both at the esophageal opening and at the base of the tongue. A lot of resection is carried out at the base of the tongue and marginal samples are taken again at the affected areas, which no longer show any invasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ. The pharyngeal suture is therefore repeated in three layers in the usual manner. At the end, insertion of Redon drains and two-layer wound closure. Insertion of a 10-gauge tracheostomy tube and transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics for three postoperative days. X-ray pre-swallow on the 10th postoperative day.","Laryngectomy, Right tongue partial resection, Bilateral neck dissection, and PEG placement, Tracheotomy

Immediate notification of the 2nd and 3rd service at 9.15 pm and anesthesia at 9.16 pm. Arrival on the ward at 9.15 p.m. and transfer of the patient to the treatment room. The patient is acutely dyspneic with increasing cyanosis. Breathing spontaneously, awake and panicked. Attempt at enoral inspection, no bleeding. The neck is massively swollen on both sides and livid. Immediate opening of the right cervical suture. Clear discharge of venous blood, no possibility of intubation, therefore an emergency coniotomy was performed at approx. 21.16.","First, after induction of intubation anesthesia, panendoscopy and inspection of the tonsil tumor, which is located in the upper part of the tonsil and merges very slightly onto the anterior palatal arch. The FK mouth retractor is then inserted and the tumor region exposed. The robot is then docked. The tumor tonsillectomy is then performed with the robot, starting with a mucosal incision close to the uvula. With resection of the anterior palatal arch and partly the posterior palatal arch, dissection into the pharyngeal musculature. The dissection is then carried out in the area of the pharyngeal muscles from cranial to caudal. Dissection takes place in the area of the lower tonsil pole at the transition to the base of the tongue. In the area of the upper third of the tonsil, the tumor borders appear to extend close to the resection. The specimen is marked here with a thread. A generous resection is then made in this area. The other margins are well within the healthy tissue. Therefore, only a frozen section is taken in the area of the upper lateral pole after the resection. This specimen is found to be tumor-free intraoperatively. Therefore, an R0 resection can now be assumed. Subtle hemostasis again. If the wound is dry, remove all instruments. After repositioning the patient, neck dissection on both sides. Now continue the operation (neck dissection on both sides) by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME> alternating head positioning for neck dissection on the right. Infiltration with 10 ml xylocaine with added adrenaline in the area of the planned skin incision on the right after marking the landmarks in the typical manner.

Separation of the skin and platysma, then exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle and exposure of the internal jugular vein. A macroscopically impressive lymph node metastasis measuring approx. 3 x 5 cm is located on the internal jugular vein. Then expose the accessorius nerve. Now locate the digastric muscle. After identification of all landmarks, insertion of the caudal and cranial retractors. Then dissect the internal jugular vein and expose the cervical vascular sheath with vagus nerve, internal jugular vein and facial vein as well as the common carotid artery. Protect the above-mentioned structures and clear out the entire posterior neck preparation while protecting the accessorius nerve and the entire cervical plexus. Now dissect anteriorly and expose the hypoglossal nerve, the capsule of the submandibular gland and complete the upper neck preparation. Hemostasis using Bipolar, resorption, no more evidence of bleeding, irrigation with Ringer. No more evidence of bleeding. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Transfer to neck dissection of the right side. Infiltration with 10 ml xylocaine with added adrenaline and another curved skin incision in the area of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection of the platysma, exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then dissection of the landmarks, the omohyoid muscle and exploration of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and finally the digastric muscle. Insertion of a retractor caudally and cranially and preparation on the anterior side of the internal jugular vein for the posterior neck preparation. Then expose the cervical vascular sheath with vagus nerve, internal jugular vein, facial vein and common carotid artery. The above-mentioned structures are spared. Tracing up to the cervical plexus. Further dissection of the accessorius nerve in a cranial direction and finally clearing out the posterior neck preparation while sparing the accessorius nerve and all plexus branches. Then dissection and exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and the capsule of the submandibular gland with completion of the anterior neck preparation. Finally, inspection without further sources of bleeding after hemostasis using bipolarization. Irrigation with Ringer. No further evidence of bleeding. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain, then two-layer wound closure. The procedure was completed without complications. The right-sided lymph node metastasis could be easily dissected from the internal jugular vein without infiltration of the surrounding structures. On the left side, level II lymph nodes approx. 1-2 cm in size were present, which are contained in their entirety in the neck preparation.

Here you can see the slightly thickened right vocal fold, which has two whitish overlays, with the whitish overlay extending dorsally to the vocal process. Even with external pressure, the glottis on the right side is not completely visible laterally, but is covered by the supraglottis. For this reason, a strip of tissue is first resected from the supraglottis. The right vocal fold is then fully visible. It can now be seen that the changes in the vocal folds do not extend into the anterior commissure. The tumor also does not extend very far laterally on palpation. Start with laser surgical chordectomy with the CO2 laser ventrally. Here, the vocal fold is resected at a sufficient microscopic safety distance. Laterally, parts of the vocalis muscle are included in the resection. The resection extends posteriorly to the arytenoid cartilage, which is exposed at the vocal process, whereby the last section of the mucosa appears inconspicuous here. The resection is then guided caudally over the subglottic slope under visualization so that the entire resectate can then be removed in toto. Suture marking on the ventral resection margin. The resection margins are then resected with cold instruments and the removed tissue is sent as a resected specimen for frozen section histology. These are all found to be tumor-free. Careful hemostasis is then performed. After receiving the frozen section histology diagnosis, the patient was extubated without any problems and handed over to the anesthesia department. Conclusion: Transoral laser surgical chordectomy on the right side for cT1a glottic laryngeal carcinoma.

In addition, the rhinoscopy revealed a large polyp in the area of the left middle nasal passage. A CT scan showed a shadow in the area of the ethmoid bone on the left and also on the right. As the patient was symptom-free with regard to the nose, the decision was made to perform a circumscribed, findings-adapted sinus operation on the left with polypectomy and laser chordectomy on the right in the case of histologically confirmed carcinoma.","After induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues, the surgeon first positions the patient. Shortening of the vibrissae, disinfection of the vestibule. Sterile wiping and draping. Entering the left nasal cavity with 45° optics. The large polyp is already visible. This is grasped at the base and successively removed. The anterior ethmoid bone is opened and the ethmoid bone is cleared out in a circumscribed manner. The base of the skull is not exposed. Subsequently, careful infundibulotomy on the left and exposure of the maxillary sinus ostium. This is carefully widened with the wing punches and smoothed in the area of the ethmoidal sinus transition with the cutting Blakesley. The maxillary sinus itself is free and without irritation. Therefore, no further measures should be taken in this area for the time being. Reposition the patient. Enter with the small irrigation tube and adjust the endolarynx. The exophytic mass described above can already be seen in the area of the right vocal fold, which extends to the anterior commissure but does not appear to infiltrate it. Laterally, it appears to extend partially into the ventriculus laryngis. Dorsally, the mass extends as far as the vocal process. Therefore, first carefully cut around the tumor with macroscopically sufficient safety distance using the laser with 4 watts in CW mode. This works very well. Successive dissection and removal of the tumor. The vocalis muscle is largely resected as well as parts of the pocket fold. As the tumor reaches the vocal process, this is also resected with the laser. Ultimately, the tumor is successfully resected in toto with a macroscopically sufficient safety margin. In between, hemostasis is repeatedly performed with a defocused laser and supratupers. Finally, marginal samples are taken in the area of the posterior pocket fold, anterior pocket fold, anterior commissure, subglottic anterior, subglottic posterior and in the area of the arytenoid cartilage. These marginal samples were all found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. An R0 resection can therefore be assumed. The procedure was completed without complications. Conclusion: Overall findings-adapted paranasal sinus surgery with polypectomy. R0 resection of a pT1a vocal fold carcinoma on the right in the frozen section. A control microlaryngoscopy should be performed in 4 to 6 weeks. Depending on the patient's symptoms, sinus surgery should be discussed at intervals.","Partial laryngectomy (endoscopic laser resection)

Now the exophytic mass can be seen, which does not quite reach the anterior commissure anteriorly, but reaches the vocal process posteriorly. Laterally, it is covered by a strip of supraglottis. Start with laser resection. First, a strip of the supraglottis is resected for the sake of clarity. The tumor is then cut horizontally at the transition from the anterior two-thirds to the posterior third of the vocal fold and guided laterally into the vocalis muscle. The anterior part of the tumor is then resected by laser surgery in healthy tissue. The resection does not quite reach the anterior commissure on the right side. The tumor is also resected macroscopically in toto towards the subglottic area under visualization. A marginal incision is then made from the lateral resection margin and from the anterior commissure. Sending for frozen section histology. Loading of the tube onto the Kleinsasser B-tube and exposure of the posterior commissure with the posterior part of the tumor. This is then also resected in the same way as for the esophagus. The vocal process is deepithelialized dorsally, and there is no evidence of tumour infiltration. After tumor resection, microscopically in healthy tissue, a marginal section is also taken from the lateral part of the posterior right glottis, from the posterior commissure and from the vocal process. All marginal histologies are examined using frozen section histology. The frozen section histology shows that all marginal sections are tumor-free, so that an R0 resection can be assumed. Careful removal of the instruments without damaging the teeth in the edentulous maxilla. End of the operation and transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Endoscopic transoral laser surgical chordectomy on the right side, for glottic laryngeal carcinoma cT1 right.","Chordectomy (Laser) on the right

Now initially advance the 0° optic through the glottic plane into the trachea. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions in the area of the trachea up to the exit of the segmental bronchi. Careful reflection. No abnormalities in the area of the cervical trachea either. Now intubation of the patient. First advance the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions in the stomach and oesophagus. Inspection of the nasopharynx, oral cavity and oropharynx. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions on all sides. Inspection of the hypopharynx on the right side. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions here too. Inspection of the hypopharynx on the left side. An uneven mucosa can be seen in the area of the median wall of the piriform sinus, which then merges into the pedunculated tumor of the aryepiglottic fold on the left side. The rest of the hypopharynx appears tumor-free. The tumor itself is localized in the area of the aryepiglottic fold, sits here on the arytenoid cartilage, but does not infiltrate the arytenoid cartilage and extends on the anterior wall to just before the pharyngoepiglottic fold. Initial inspection of the subglottis and glottis. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions in these regions. Adjustment of the tumor with the large small bore tube. The entire extent of the tumor can be clearly visualized, but the extension of the tumor along the postcricoid region is difficult. Now start to cut around the tumor in the area of the pharyngoepiglottic fold and in the area of the anterior margin of the hypopharyngeal duct. Cut around the tumor in all planes, whereby the postcricoid region on the left side is included in the laser resection. Finally, the tumour can be completely mobilized under the microscope at low intensities and, as far as can be assessed microscopically, completely removed from the healthy tissue. Although the arytenoid cartilage itself is visualized, it does not have to be resected. Considering the exposure of the tumor, the preparation conditions are considerably more difficult. Marginal samples are now taken at all levels, which are found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. Careful hemostasis. Considering the localization and the difficult exposure of the tumor, the preparation conditions are significantly more difficult. Finally, another check for blood dryness. Overall, no evidence of active bleeding. Termination of the procedure. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist. The operation was performed using an endoscope, surgical microscope and laser. In view of the histology of the tumor, a neck dissection on the left side, possibly on the right, must be discussed.","Laser resection, Panendoscopy

The above-mentioned surgery was therefore indicated.","First, reclination of the head again, then pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy with the Kleinsasser tube. The described tumor is seen on the anterior palatal arch with transition to the tonsillar lobe, transition to the alveolar ridge, reaching down to the glossoalveolar groove and extending to the base of the tongue. This is followed by transoral resection of the tumor with the electric needle with a safety margin of at least 1 cm on all sides. Tissue is removed from the alveolar ridge, whereby the periosteal layer can be almost completely preserved. Further development of the tumor with removal of the tonsil loge and part of the pharyngeal wall as well as part of the base of the tongue. Tumor is thread-marked. Subsequent sampling of the margin on the right from the alveolar ridge to the glossoalveolar groove. Margin samples are thread-marked with the thread-marked tumor preparation for frozen section. Here, tumor specimen on all sides in healthy tissue, somewhat narrow laterally. In combination with the lateral margin specimen, which shows no tumor infiltrates, then definitely R0. Careful hemostasis follows. Insertion of swabs. Now repositioning, injection of a total of 15 ml Ultracaine 1 % with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. Skin disinfection, sterile draping. Neck dissection on both sides, starting with the right side: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid process. Preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the anterior edge of the muscle and dissection of the lymph node package. Subsequent exposure of the cervical vascular sheath with the internal jugular artery, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery and outlets from the external carotid artery. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, successive development of the neck preparation, including levels II to IV and parts of V. Subsequent careful hemostasis, irrigation of the wound and layered wound closure with insertion of a Redon drainage. Neck dissection on the left: This is performed in the same way as on the right side. Level II to IV and parts of V are also removed here. After careful hemostasis, the wound is closed in layers and a Redon drain is inserted. Subsequent tracheotomy by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Small Kocher collar incision. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue up to the infrahyoid musculature. In the area of the linea alba, spread it. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped off, severed and supplied with puncture ligatures. Subsequent exposure of the trachea. Entry into the trachea in the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space, the skin is mobilized a little beforehand. Subsequent insertion into the trachea, creation of a broadly pedicled, modified Björk flap. This is then epithelized without any problems and with little tension. A size 8 tracheal cannula was then inserted and the enoral findings were checked again. Fresh blood was visible from the nose and mouth, so the Mc Ivor blade was inserted again. No bleeding was visible transorally in the wound bed, but there was bleeding from the nasopharynx or from the nose in the presence of mucosal swelling or conchal injury, so a merocele tamponade was inserted on both sides. This can be removed the next day if the findings are normal. Overall transoral resection of a cT2 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Posterior palatal arch and base of tongue essentially preserved. Flap coverage not required.

The above-mentioned operation was therefore indicated.,"First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The exophytic tumor is seen in the right hypopharyngeal region at the border to the oropharynx, beginning caudally, occupying the entire wall of the piriform sinus, with invasion into the right laryngeal skeleton. Tip of piriform sinus and esophageal entrance free. Base of tongue free. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned operation confirmed. The patient is now repositioned. Skin disinfection and injection of a total of 20 ml xylocaine 1% with adrenaline. Then start with the neck dissection modified radically on both sides: insertion of the apron flap in a typical subplatysmal manner up to beyond the hyoid bone and up to the submandibular gland on both sides. Then start with the right side: exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, external jugular vein, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Lymph node package from cranial to caudal must be detached from the internal jugular vein in case of strong adherence. It extends to caudal level Vb. Removal of the dorsal neck specimen, taking level V with it. Accessory nerve is exposed and preserved. The anterior neck specimen is then removed. Neck dissection on the left side: This is performed in the same way as on the right side. Overall evacuation level II to V as on the opposite side. Now laryngectomy with subtotal pharyngectomy: Prelaryngeal fatty tissue is also removed as part of the level VI neck dissection. Hyoid bone is detached from the suprahyoid musculature. Exposure of the pharyngeal wall. Pre-epiglottic fatty tissue is removed. Exposure of the superior cornu on both sides and dissection of the constrictor pharyngeal muscle, whereby this is mainly done on the left side. Dissection is omitted on the right side if there is a tumor. Dissection of the piriform sinus on the left. Caudal dissection of the thyroid gland on both sides. Tracheostomy and intubation. Insertion of laryngectomy tube. Subsequent paramedian insertion at epiglottis level. Dissection of lingual mucosa. Exposure of the epiglottis. The tumor is visible, which begins just below and medially in the epiglottis area. Tumor grows cranially in the direction of the tonsil lobe. Located approx. 1 cm away from the tumor, satellites can be seen in the caudal ................ area of the tonsillar lobe. These are cut around with a safety margin of 1 cm and removed. There are also satellites in the area of the posterior hypopharyngeal wall, so that the posterior hypopharyngeal wall must be subtotally removed. There is also a satellite focus in the arytenoid region on the left side. This results in a laryngectomy and a subtotal pharyngectomy. Laryngectomy specimen is thread-marked. Marginal samples are taken cranially laterally with marking towards the base of the tongue and cranially medially (marking of the tonsil lobe) as well as from the remaining hypopharyngeal wall up to the postcricoid area. Suture marking here as well. Small nodular infiltrations of an invasive tumor in the posterior hypopharyngeal wall in the specimen. Remaining margins and all marginal samples free. A resection in the postcricoid region and posterior hypopharyngeal wall as well as a margin specimen in this area is performed to be on the safe side. Tumor-free in the frozen section. It can now be definitively assumed that the resection is R0. This is followed by irrigation of the entire wound area. Due to the size of the defect after subtotal pharyngectomy and resection of the oropharynx up to the tonsil lobe and palatal arch, indication for defect coverage. The area in the right thigh was already sterilely draped at the time of insertion. The antero-lateral femoral flap is now removed: mark the spina and lateral edge of the patella. Locate the perforators along this line with the Doppler and mark them. These are located in a typical position or slightly cranial to it. The size of the flap was measured beforehand and is recorded in a length of 10 cm and a width of 4 to 8 mm according to the shape of the defect. Cut around the flap medially up to the fascia. Push the flap in the direction of the perforator. Identification of the rectus muscle and lateral vastus. Expose the perforators and the vascular pedicle. Cut around the flap caudally and laterally up to the fascia and dissect up to the septum. Expose the pedicle caudally and tie it under with ligatures. Successive development of the musculo-fasciocutaneous flap while carefully preserving the musculocutaneous perforators. If necessary, the vastus lateralis muscle is also removed. Finally, complete the cranial incision after the course of the perforators has been secured. Subsequent exposure of the pedicle. This consists of a strong ramus descendens and 2 strong accompanying veins. The artery is placed shortly before entering the profunda femoris artery. The 2nd artery is supplied with a stitching suture. 2 accompanying veins are placed before entering the profunda femoris vein or .........circumflexa iliaca and supplied with ligatures. The flap is flushed with heparin. Careful hemostasis is performed in the area of the thigh and the wound is closed in layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. The defect is then covered with a thigh flap: Fitting the flap into the defect. This fits without tension. Successive suturing using Vicryl 3/0 single button sutures. Flap can be sutured in without tension. Subsequent dissection of the vascular pedicle. The superior thyroid artery and the outlet of a superior thyroid vein from the internal jugular vein are dissected in good time. Subsequent conditioning and preparation of the flap vessels. Suture of the superior thyroid artery to the descending ramus with Ehtilon 8/0 using the end-to-end technique. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow and good venous return. Subsequent selection of the larger vein with better venous return. After measuring, selection of a coupler size 3 mm. Connection of the vessels using the coupler. Good venous return after opening the artery. Alignment test positive. The 2nd vein is closed using clips. Subsequent irrigation of the wound area. Careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers and insertion of a Redon drain into each side of the neck and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Marking of the vessels for Doppler monitoring. Insertion of a 10 mm tracheal cannula, which is fixed with sutures. Good Doppler signal at the end of the operation. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Please administer antibiotics with Unacid 3 x 3 g per day for one week. .............. via the inserted PEG for 10 days. After swallowing gruel, build up diet if necessary. Gastric tube should remain in place as a splint. Overall cT4 hypopharyngeal carcinoma with invasion into the larynx. Several satellites were resected. Overall, satellite-like multicentric growth. In addition, extensive lymph node metastasis, especially on the right.

Due to the extent of the tumor, information was also provided about flaps as free flap plasty or pedicled flap plasty.","Pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The hypopharyngeal tumor is seen on the right, which extends to just before the base of the tongue and grows into the epiglottis and also grows laterally further caudal to the larynx in the area of the aryepiglottic fold. Tip of the piriform sinus free. Overall, surgery is now confirmed as an indication. The patient is now repositioned. Skin disinfection. Sterile draping of all relevant surgical areas. Start of the operation with apron flap, left neck revision and tracheostoma placement. Marking of the apron flap in the area of the former neck sutures. Now incision of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Identification of the platysma and transection of the platysma. <CLINICIAN_NAME> on the left side, <CLINICIAN_NAME> on the right side: Identification of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and careful dissection along the muscle in depth to protect the cervical vascular nerve sheath. Overall very scarred conditions after radiotherapy. Identification of the accessorius nerve on both sides. Identification of the submandibular gland and the posterior venter of the digastric muscle. Identification of the jugular vein, the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Identification of the omohyoid muscle and dissection of the muscle. After palpatory identification of the hyoid bone, the hyoid bone is detached from the base of the tongue at the cranial end. Identification of the hypoglossal nerve on both sides, which can be spared. Now detach the prelaryngeal musculature from the laryngeal skeleton. Dissect the laryngeal skeleton while sparing the constrictor pharyngeus inferior muscle and lateralizing the cervical vascular nerve sheath. Now detach the thyroid gland from the left and right. Two suspicious lymph nodes are removed on the left side in region II, which were previously identified by ultrasound. No suspicious masses were found during the other dissection. The laryngeal opening and tumor resection is dictated by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Tracheotomy was also performed. Wound closure by means of implanted cartilage is seen in patients who have already undergone a tracheotomy. The cartilage cover can be released and the trachea opened. At the end of the operation, two-layer wound closure using cutaneous and subcutaneous sutures. Placement of 2 Redon drains and completion of the surgical procedure without complications. PEG insertion: After abdominal surgery, a good diaphanoscopy was performed in an attempt to insert a PEG using the thread pull-through method, but a mass was palpable above the diaphanoscopy and a dark shadow was visible. Gastroscopically, the stomach appears anatomically altered and small. For these two reasons, a PEG is not inserted. Should a fistula form, a PEG should be inserted in the surgical department or in Medical Clinic 1. Subsequent laryngectomy and partial pharyngectomy: First dissection of the infrahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone and knocking them down caudally. Detachment of the suprahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone. Exposure of the .........superior on the left. Dissection of the pharyngeal tube. Dissect the thyroid gland caudolaterally on both sides. Subsequent exposure of the epiglottis from the left. Entering the pharyngeal space. It can be seen that the tumor on the left has grown almost to the base of the tongue. Partial resection of the base of the tongue from the middle to the right is therefore performed. The tumor is resected macroscopically with a safety margin of 1.5 cm on all sides. The entire pharyngeal wall on the left and caudal parts of the base of the tongue are resected. Caudally, the mucosa in the postcricoid area is removed. On the left side, the hypopharynx can be preserved as far as possible. Finally, the larynx and parts of the pharynx are removed. Due to the expansion at the base of the tongue, an extensive marginal sample is taken from the entire base of the tongue. Both the main specimen and the marginal specimen in the base of the tongue are sent in marked with sutures for frozen sectioning. Here, marginal samples of the base of the tongue are free, but there are still infiltrates at the transition from the base of the tongue or epiglottis to the lateral pharyngeal wall on the right. Therefore, another extensive resection of the mucosa on the right and removal of a marginal sample from the point where the base of the tongue was free down to almost the transition to the postcricoid area. Here the marginal sample was then subsequently free, so now R0 resection. Ultimately, the resection extends cranially to the tonsillar lobe to just under the palatal arch. Flap coverage is therefore necessary to enable tension-free closure, especially after radiation. Due to the overall situation and the good conditions in the area of the chest wall, the decision was made to elevate a pectoralis major flap to cover the defect, from the right side. Then lift and suture the pectoralis major flap. Lifting the pectoralis major flap: Locate the lateral end of the pectoralis major in the line connecting the axilla and the lower edge of the sternum. Dissection of a deltopectoral flap and undermining of the skin until a complete hand fits through. Now locate the pedicle. Measure the length of the flap with a compress and mark the skin area. Now cut around the skin area and dissect through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. The pectoralis major muscle is now separated from the chest along the lateral muscle edge to create the myofasciocutaneous flap. Suture with Vicryl 4-0 to prevent shearing. Successive further elevation of the flap with dissection along and through the pectoralis major muscle. The pedicle is visible the entire time and can be spared without any problems. Once the length of the flap is sufficient, fold it over and suture it in inverted form onto the remaining pharyngeal tube. Suture the muscles to the prevertebral fascia on both sides. A Provox is not inserted in the case of post-radiation. Insertion of 2 Redon drains in the chest as well as one Redon drain cervical right and one Redon drain cervical left. Two-layer wound closure of both the breast defect and the cervical defect on both sides. Careful suturing of the tracheostoma. Suturing of a 10-gauge ruffled cannula and suturing of this. Completion of the operation. The patient should continue to receive antibiotics with Unacid 3 g. An X-ray gruel swallow is possible after 14 days at the earliest. Subsequent irrigation of the wound area. Hemostasis and wound closure in layers, with insertion of two Redon drains into the side of the neck and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. The procedure was completed without complications. PEG placement was attempted intraoperatively, but was not possible due to insufficient diaphanoscopy. Therefore, please register patients for PEG placement in the surgery department or in Medical Clinic 1 at intervals. Until then, nutrition via the inserted gastric tube. Total second carcinoma of the hypopharynx R0-resected with partial pharyngectomy and laryngectomy. A myotomy was created on the left side to facilitate passage later. On the advice of the phoniatrists, a Provox prosthesis was not inserted. This should also be inserted at intervals. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics for one week. X-ray pelvic examination after 14 days, then, if necessary, a diet. Presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference to determine further treatment. If nodes on the left are positive, radiochemotherapy will probably be necessary.","Resection, Left-sided neck dissection (0/2), Defect coverage, Pedicled flap (Pectoralis major), Tracheotomy

Initially, the patient was scheduled for laser resection and neck on both sides.","First, induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: The described tumor is found in the hypopharynx on the left, but it is larger and more massive than expected, above all it reaches a thickness and shows submucosal growth size, rather cT2 and growth towards the tip of the sinus as well as towards the aryepiglottic fold and towards the thyroid cartilage. Overall, no indication for laser resection, therefore indication for transoral surgery with subsequent flap coverage. Then sterile washing and draping in the neck area and performance of a tracheotomy by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: injection of 5 ml Ultracaine with Suprarenin additive along the skin incision. Now incision with the 15 mm scalpel and skin incision. Longitudinally directed approx. 5 cm long between cricoid and jugulum. Very short and thick neck. Sharp cutting of skin and platysma. Dissection in depth. Easy exposure of the linea alba. Dissection of this, exposure of the thyroid capsule. Entering with the Overholt clamp and passing under the isthmus. Bipolar coagulation of the isthmus of the thyroid gland. Exposure of the trachea and insertion with the pointed scissors between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring using Ethibond suture Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis. Now gastroscopy and PEG insertion: Now enter with the gastroesophagoscope and advance into the stomach with air insufflation. Once in the stomach, the stomach is inflated. A spontaneous diaphanoscopy is seen below the costal arch. A PEG is also inserted here using the thread pull-through method. There are no complications. The patient received clindamycin 600 mg perioperatively due to an allergy to amoxicillin and penicillin. Then, the Kleinsasser tube and the spreading laryngoscope were inserted and the tumor was inspected by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The tumor was significantly larger than previously described and could no longer be resected by laser. The decision was therefore made to perform a transcervical tumor resection using flap coverage. Repositioning of the patient and sterile draping of all relevant surgical areas. First, creation of an apron flap in the typical manner up to the level of the hyoid bone or submandibular gland. Then radical neck dissection on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Lymph node conglomerate is seen cranially, which infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle. First visualization of the V. facialis from cranial to caudal until it flows into the V. jugularis interna, here already caking with the lymph node conglomerate is visible. Therefore, exposure of the internal jugular vein further caudally, here some outlets to the thyroid gland can be dissected and preserved, as well as other jugular outlets. Further dissection cranially shows infiltration into the wall. Resection is therefore now necessary. The facial vein is ligated first. Subsequent medial exposure of the common carotid artery, external carotid artery and internal carotid artery; these can each be dissected, as can the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Then cranial exposure of the internal jugular vein successively after dissection of the lymph node conglomerate of the digastric muscle. The hypoglossal nerve can also be dissected here. Then caudal transection of the internal jugular vein and double ligation, once using the puncture technique. The caudal branches can remain intact. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is then severed. This is also resected from the cranial side near the insertion. The accessory nerve runs into the lymph node conglomerate and cannot be preserved. Exposure of the upper part of the internal jugular vein close to the base of the skull, which is then ligated twice and removed. The remaining parts of levels II to V are then evacuated, exposing and preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Here too, several positive lymph nodes, especially in level V. Overall, several lymph node metastases clinically clearly on the left. Clearing of the anterior neck specimen with visualization and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. Then transcervical resection of the hypopharyngeal carcinoma with partial laryngeal resection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: First visualization of the hyoid bone and dissection of the muscles. Hyoid bone is resected. Infrahyoid muscles are cut down caudally with the thyroid lobe including the superior thyroid artery. Pharyngeal wall is exposed. The carotid artery is looped with the vagus nerve using the vessel loop and pulled slightly to the side; the superior laryngeal nerve is also exposed and pulled cranially using the vessel loop. Then enter the pharyngeal space at the level of the hyoid bone. Exposure of the tumor. The tumor is then cut around with a safety margin of 1.5 to 2 cm on all sides. The posterior wall of the hypopharynx, the piriform sinus up to the esophageal entrance or tip of the sinus, as well as part of the arytenoid fold, tumor also grows posteriorly towards the thyroid cartilage, therefore lateral resection of approx. 50 % to 60 % of the thyroid cartilage. A macroscopic resection is achieved well within the healthy tissue. The tumor is finally marked with sutures. A marginal sample is taken from the arytenoid region up to the piriform sinus entrance from the medial side. Like the specimen, this is also thread-marked for frozen section evaluation. In the frozen section, both the tumor and the marginal sample are healthy. Therefore R0 resection. Subsequent careful hemostasis and irrigation of the wound area. Neck dissection on the right side through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. After creating the apron flap, sharply dissect the skin platysma flap with the scalpel. The external jugular vein is not exposed. The auricularis magnus nerve is exposed and cut. Dissection along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in depth, the accessorius nerve is exposed and spared. The posterior abdomen of the digastric muscle is also exposed, the submandibular gland is seen medially, which is also exposed without difficulty. The omohyoid muscle is shown caudally, which represents the borders of the neck dissection. Here as a vascular sheath directly in the depth below the neck preparation. The internal jugular vein is exposed from caudal to cranial, there is no injury to the structures here. The superior thyroid vein and the facial vein are dissected and spared. The external and internal carotid arteries, the vagus nerve and the cervical artery are exposed medial to the jugular vein. The neck preparation is now detached in level IIb, followed by level IIa, sparing the accessorius nerve. Levels III, IV and V are also detached without difficulty. The plexus branches are visualized and specifically protected. A chyle fistula occurs caudally when the preparation is removed. The anterior neck preparation is now almost exposed and dissected along the V. facialis and the V. thyroidea superior. Removal of the split skin: A split skin from the left thigh measuring 11 x 8 cm is easily removed using a dermatome. Then lift the radialis graft parallel to it, here see the corresponding dictation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap boundaries (8.5 x 14 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Covering of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Removal of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and beginning with the arterial anastomosis to the superior thyroid artery. Then 3 venous anastomoses twice to the facial vein and then additionally to a direct outlet to the internal jugular vein. Then insertion of the graft into the defect and suturing of the graft, which is relatively difficult, especially in the area of the base of the tongue, due to existing tension. The graft is slightly too wide in the upper area and also in the lower area. The graft still needs to be trimmed slightly at the esophageal entrance. This is possible as the anastomosis is already in place. Then sutures are placed and the esophageal entrance is reconstructed using the radialis graft. Then successive suturing of the remaining graft in the pharyngeal and tongue base area. The flap stalk itself is extremely thick due to severe adiposity on the forearm, making it relatively difficult to integrate the raised skin monitor into the suture. Initially, an attempt is made to cut an additional hole in the apron flap and pull the skin monitor through, but this causes tension and twisting in the flap handle, so this is removed again and the hole is sutured. The skin monitor is ultimately integrated into the skin suture next to the tracheostoma. The tracheostoma was sutured with Ethibond sutures. At the end, 2 flaps are inserted on both sides and the wound is closed in two layers in the neck area. Insertion of a tracheostomy tube. Suturing of a tracheostomy tube and the patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics for at least 3 days. Daily flap checks on the skin monitor, if necessary also directly via a mouth spatula. In addition, a marker was placed for a Doppler so that the flap can be checked three times. Flap control according to the usual scheme.","Tumor resection, Tracheostomy, PEG placement, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Palpation revealed an intraparotid mass on the right side measuring approx. 2 x 3 cm. Sonography revealed an unclear mass on the right cervical side (level II) with contact to the lower pole of the right parotid gland, with a suspected lateral neck cyst (DD parotid cyst). Therefore, the indication was to perform extirpation of the unclear mass and, depending on the intraoperative findings, to perform a tonsillectomy or parotid surgery if necessary.","After problem-free induction of anesthesia and intubation of the patient by the anesthesia colleagues, the patient was initially positioned. Injection of 8 ml xylocaine with added adrenaline at the level of the described level II mass on the right, after disinfection. Then ablation of the surgical site. Sterile draping. The skin incision is then made at the level of the level II right cervical mass with a length of approx. 5 cm at the level of a skin fold approx. 2 transverse fingers below the mandibular branch. Cut through the skin of the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle. While spreading the tissue, expose the auricularis magnus muscle. Finally, exposing the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle while protecting it. Further dissection in depth and finally locating the capsule of the cystic mass. Finally, the capsule of the cystic mass can be visualized, which appears to be generally plump and elastic. During further dissection, however, the capsule tears and a serous milky secretion is discharged. The mass is then dissected free from the surrounding tissue along its capsule. It can be seen that the mass, especially the cranial part, lies against the lower pole of the parotid gland on the right side. Dorsally, the accessorius nerve can be visualized and traced cranially, which descends into the depths below the digaster muscle shown. Finally, the internal jugular vein can be visualized below the digaster muscle. Further mobilization of the mass reveals a mass medially of the mass, directly adjacent to it, which corresponds clinically to a lymph node. Therefore, an atypically located lateral neck cyst is suspected. Finally, the cystic mass is successfully removed after spreading the surrounding tissue, sparing the accessorius and auricular nerves as well as the internal jugular vein. No duct structure can be traced or visualized in the direction of the tonsillar lobe. Finally, hemostasis, dry wound conditions. Then insertion of an 8-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure as well as a sterile wound dressing. Finally, the tonsillectomy was performed on the right side. For this, the patient was positioned head down and a Mc Ivor spatula was inserted. Inspection of the right tonsil lobe, which is fissured and relatively atrophic and small. The mucosal incision is then made loco typico close to the uvula, in the area of the anterior palatal arch, cranially in an envelope fold. The tonsil capsule and the upper pole of the right tonsil are then exposed. Bipolar coagulation of the feeding tonsil vessels and sharp transection, the capsule is then peeled out of its tonsil bed after extending the mucosal incisions caudally and deposited at the lower pole. After extensive bipolar coagulation of the feeding cords at the caudal pole. Finally, extensive hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation and insertion of an H2O2-soaked swab. After removal of the swab and a relaxation time of approx. 5 min, the tonsil lobe on the right is dry. The procedure is then completed. Summarizing remarks: During the operation, a cystic mass was extirpated on the right cervical side (level II) and a right tonsillectomy was performed if an atypical lateral neck cyst was suspected. The inserted Redon drainage can be removed on the 2nd postoperative day.","Tonsillectomy (without adenotonsillectomy): With dissection technique

A tumor of the anterior commissure is seen here, which is mainly located in the anterior third of the left vocal fold and then reaches the right vocal fold via the anterior commissure and also appears to infiltrate it. The patient is extremely difficult to adjust, which is why an external resection is indicated due to the tumor location and adjustability. The patient is therefore first repositioned and local anesthetic with adrenaline is injected. Then a zigzag-shaped prelaryngeal incision is made. Layered preparation in depth. Ligation of larger veins. Then exposure of the laryngeal skeleton. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and exposure of the ligamentum conicum. Transverse incision of the ligamentum conicum and subsequent execution of the thyrofissure. This is performed in the midline. Then open the endolarynx in the anterior commissure. The tumor described above can be seen on the left side and in the anterior part of the right side. The tumor is then undermined at the base of the thyroid cartilage and initially detached. The tumor is then resected tangentially with a sufficient safety margin on the left side. The specimen is suture-marked with the caudal, dorsal and cranial suture markings for the frozen section. These resection margins are all found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. Then take a marginal sample from the anterior commissure at the caudal deposition area. This is also tumor-free in the frozen section. Then move to the right side and also undermine the tumor on the perichondrium. Here too, tangential resection of the tumor with a sufficient safety margin. In the dorsal settling area, take a marginal sample, which is also assessed as tumor-free in the frozen section. Then fixation of the vocal fold on the right side at the anterior commissure, which had been detached here. To do this, two mattress sutures were placed on the anterior edge of the thyroid cartilage in the area of the thyrofissure line. Then adaptation of the resection margins in the area of the separation on the left vocal fold. Here too, mobilization of the soft tissue and suturing anteriorly to the thyrofissure margin. Then measure a laryngeal larynx. This is then inserted in a size of 14 mm and the thyroid cartilage is adapted. Then suture the ligamentum conicum. Suture of the prelaryngeal musculature. Subsequent two-layer wound closure after insertion of a wound flap and application of a pressure bandage. Final discussion with the anesthesia colleagues. Due to the location and adjustability, this tumor of the anterior commissure as well as the left vocal fold and the anterior part of the right vocal fold had to be resected from the outside. Based on the representative marginal samples, the specimen shows an R0 resection.
