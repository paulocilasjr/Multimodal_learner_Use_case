Clinically as well as sonographically and computed tomography cT3 cN2b. In addition, nodular goiter on both sides with nodes > 2 cm each. All common tumor options (surgery versus primary radiochemotherapy) were discussed in detail with the patient in advance. There is now an indication for surgical treatment in the form of a laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy, neck dissection on both sides and hemi-thyroidectomy. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carrying out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Induction of anesthesia and orotracheal intubation of the patient. Initial positioning of the patient by the surgeon. First, a new panendoscopy is performed to plan the surgical procedure. Insertion of the mouth guard and insertion of the size C small bore tube. This confirms the size expansion described above. Subsequent placement of a nasogastric feeding tube without any problems. Positioning of the patient in head reclination. Superficial skin disinfection. Infiltration anesthesia with a total of 15 ml xylocaine with adrenaline added in the area of the incision for the planned apron flap. Subsequent ablation of the surgical area and sterile draping. First mark the planned incision. Skin incision and lifting of a broad-based apron flap, with strictly subplatysmal preparation. Insertion of the chain dog. First start of neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle as the caudal border and the posterior digastric venter muscle as the cranial border. Expose the capsule of the submandibular gland. Turning to the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the internal jugular vein and the venous angle including protection of the facial vein. Exposure of the common carotid artery, the bifurcation and the internal and external carotid artery. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. The cervical artery cannot be spared intraoperatively. An extensive metastatic conglomerate can now be seen in levels II and III up to just before level IV, which appears to be firmly attached to the surrounding area. The soft tissue metastasis can only be separated from the internal jugular vein with difficulty. The metastatic conglomerate extends very far medially and reaches the vagus nerve. Therefore, first relocation, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve. This can be spared. Intraoperatively, the border cord appears to be firmly attached to the metastatic conglomerate. First develop the lateral neck preparation, whereby the cervical plexus branches can largely be spared here. Turn to the medial neck preparation. The hypoglossal nerve is also exposed here. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve. Protection of the nerve. Successive development of the medial neck preparation. Moving on to the left side: the same procedure in principle here. First expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle as the caudal border and the posterior digastric venter muscle as the cranial border. Turning to the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the internal jugular vein from the caudal to the cranial border. Exposure of the facial vein and protection of the same. Exposure of the common carotid artery, the bifurcation and the internal and external carotid artery. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the same. Protection of the nerve. Development of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the cervical plexus branches. Exposure of the submandibular gland capsule and the hypoglossal nerve. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the nerve. Development of the medial neck preparation. Transition to visualization of the hypoid. Subsequent separation of the infrahyoid muscles using the electric knife. The sternohyoid muscle is cut caudally. Then supply the upper laryngeal bundle on both sides. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage horn on the left side. Incision of the perichondrium and release of the left-sided piriform sinus with the raspatory as well as with the pedicle swab. Subsequent exposure of the trachea and the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the isthmus and repositioning of the isthmus. Exposure, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve. This shows the large thyroid nodus described by sonography and computed tomography. Due to the prominent left-sided thyroid lobe and the slightly suspicious intraoperative appearance of the nodule, the decision was made to perform a hemithyroidectomy on the left side. Care is taken to preserve the epithelial bodies. The ventral trachea is then exposed. Proceed to the tracheotomy. Enter below the 1st tracheal clasp and transfer to an LE tube. Then open the pharynx infrahyoidally in the median line. Expose the upper edge of the epiglottis. Grasp the epiglottis and dislocate it through a relatively small pharyngotomy. You now have a good view of the extent of the tumor. First start resection in the area of the left-sided aryepiglottic fold. Mucosa-sparing incision up to just before the arytenoid cartilage. Then widen the incision caudally and in the area of the postcricoid. Hemostasis of several small bleedings from the laryngopharyngeal plexus. Subsequent counter-preparation from the left side. Here, too, the incision is made in the area of the aryepiglottic fold, whereby this is extended into the pharynx due to the tumor extension into the right-sided piriform sinus. In between, further release of the laryngeal skeleton with the attached soft tissue cuff. Deposition of the trachea at the level of the 1st tracheal cartilage and resection of the larynx and the right-sided piriform sinus in toto. The specimen is sent in thread-marked for definitive histology. Meticulous inspection of the tumor specimen and subsequent removal of corresponding marginal samples, which are sent for intraoperative frozen section diagnostics. In the meantime, meticulous hemostasis. Announcement of the intraoperative frozen section diagnosis: This shows a tumor-free resection margin, which is why an R0 situation can be assumed intraoperatively. Perform a rather restrained myotomy in the area of the upper esophageal sphincter so as not to provoke reflux problems postoperatively. The placement of a Provox prosthesis is deliberately avoided for the time being due to the relatively narrow remaining pharyngeal tube. Dissection of the left-sided sternal part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This results in slightly more severe venous bleeding, which can be stopped with the aid of three inversion stitches. Then perform the inverting pharyngeal suture with Vicryl 3.0 RB-1 using the single-button suture technique. This is performed in a T-shaped configuration. Extremely meticulous work is carried out at the base of the tongue and caudally at the level of the stoma in order to further reduce the risk of fistula formation at these predilection sites. Grasping the lateral musculature and suturing it using a continuous overlocking suture technique in the sense of a second layer. Application of a layer of TachoSil. Grasping of the remaining peripheral soft tissue, which is additionally stitched over the pharyngeal suture as a fourth layer. The sternohyoid muscle, which has previously been folded caudally, is also stitched over the wound bed. Then irrigate the wound with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Insertion of two 10-gauge Redon drains and circular epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Subcutaneous suturing with Vicryl 4.0 and skin suturing with Ethilon 5.0. Application of a pressure dressing and transfer of the patient to a 10-gauge high-volume low-pressure cannula. Completion of the procedure without complications. Final consultation with the anesthesia department. The patient received 3 g Unacid i.v. intraoperatively. Antibiotics should be continued postoperatively for five days.","TU resection, Neck dissection bilateral

The tumor begins in the middle of the epiglottis, extends to the left into the area of the vallecula, along the aryepiglottic fold to the left arytenoid cartilage. The tumor ends just above the left pouch ligament. In addition, the tumor reaches the lateral pharyngeal wall on the left via the pharyngoepiglottic fold.","Initial consultation with the anesthesiologist. Dissection of the tumor, histologically confirmed as squamous cell carcinoma, with the spreading laryngoscope. Cleavage of the epiglottis in the midline and dissection along the vallecula. Dissection of the pharyngoepiglottic fold and successive resection of the tumor, including the pharyngoepiglottic fold, the aryepiglottic fold and the pouch ligament. In addition, the tip of the arytenoid cartilage is also resected so that ultimately only the vocal process and the muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage remain. Careful dissection outside the tumor manifestation. Removal of the tumor in the area of the arytenoid cartilage and directly in the area of the pouch ligament on the left side. Resection of part of the right-sided epiglottis as a resection and finally obtaining numerous marginal samples. Intraoperatively, one has the impression of having resected healthy tissue. The marginal samples are found to be tumor-free. Extremely difficult preparation conditions due to the size of the tumor. Several intraoperative consultations with the anaesthetist due to the localization of the tube and bleeding. Careful hemostasis. Advancement of the flexible endoscope into the stomach. Placement of a PEG after visualization of the diaphanoscopy in the usual manner. On reflection, the stomach and esophagus are unremarkable. Repositioning of the patient, initially for modified radical neck dissection on the right side. Apply local anesthesia along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Abjode and cover the surgical area. Skin incision starting in the area of the mastoid tip, along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle up to the clavicle. Cut through the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the auricularis magnus nerve. Displacement to the cranial side and at the end of the operation re-embedding of the same in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the external jugular vein, which is also preserved, relocated cranially and re-embedded at the end of the operation. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Displacement and re-embedding of the accessorius nerve at the end of the operation in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the common carotid artery, the internal and external carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, the vagus nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the posterior venter of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the parotid gland. Removal of lymphatic and connective tissue in the area of levels IV and V. Here, the fascia of the deep neck muscles is dissected, the cervical plexus is exposed, displaced accordingly and spared. Dissection in a caudal direction. Exposure of the scalene gap. Exposure of the brachial plexus and the phrenic nerve. These structures are also spared. Deposition of the specimen supraclavicularly. Careful hemostasis. Exposure of the facial vein. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the capsule of the submandibular gland. Removal of the lymphatic and connective tissue in the area of levels Ib, II and III. Intraoperatively, several smaller lymph nodes were found, but these were not suspicious for malignant infestation. Irrigation of the wound with water and hydrogen. Insertion of a redon drain. Wound closure in layers. Application of a pressure dressing. This results in a modified radical neck dissection of level Ib to V. The patient is then repositioned for neck dissection on the left side. A large level II, III metastatic mass extending into the caudal parotid gland is already visible. First mark the planned incision. Cut through the cutis and subcutis. Expose the platysma and cut it sharply. Expose the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissect it from caudal to cranial. Exposure of the omohydius muscle as the caudal border. From level III, an extensive, obviously capsule-overwriting metastatic comglomerate is visible, which extends into the subcutaneous level. The sternocleidomatoid muscle appears to be widely infiltrated here. Therefore, first mobilize the conglomerate and take a corresponding skin spindle in the area of the infiltration of the subcutaneous tissue. Insertion of the lower retractor. Turn to the jugular vascular sheath. Expose the internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery. Initial attempt to preserve the internal jugular vein. From level III, however, it becomes apparent that this is infiltrated over a large area by the metastatic conglomerate. Therefore, initially caudal dissection and double ligation as well as bypassing of the jugular vein stump. Dissect medially and cranially. Exposure of the digastric muscle. This also appears to be infiltrated by the tumor in the area of the posterior venter. The hypoglossal nerve located inferior to it also appears to be initially drawn into the metastasis. Extremely careful blunt dissection here. With great effort, it is finally possible to separate the nerve stump from the metastasis. The nerve is moved cranially in the sense of a neurolysis and can be spared during the operation. The facial vein and its branches must also be severed and ligated. Exposure of the carotid bifurcation and the internal and external carotid artery. Successive detachment of the metastatic conglomerate, which also infiltrates the caudal glandular pole of the parotid gland over a wide area. Parts of the oral branch must also be resected, as this is enveloped by the tumor infiltrate over a medium to long distance. In the meantime, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is also removed at the inferior margin. Cranially, the muscle is also detached at its point of attachment to the mastoid. The accessorius nerve can be separated from the metastatic conglomerate with difficulty. The metastatic conglomerate can be resected in toto after exposing, separating and legaturizing the cranial jugular part. The lateral neck preparation is then developed up to level V. The plexus branches are largely spared. At the end of the operation there is no evidence of chyle flow. Subsequent development of the medial neck preparation. Careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Dry wound conditions at the end of the operation. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redondra ring. Subcutaneous suture with Vicryl 4-0 and skin suture with Ethilon 5-0. Repositioning of the patient for tracheotomy. Initial palpatory identification of the ring button level. Marking of the same. Creation of the skin incision in the form of an inverted T approx. 2 cm below the level of the ring node. Sharp transection of the cutis and subcutis. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the linea alba. Incision in the area of the linea alba and blunt lateral dissection of the muscle bellies. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining of the same. Generous coagulation of the thyroid isthmus and insertion of the retractors. Subsequent identification of the button space between the second and third tracheal cartilage. Incision of the trachea and preparation of a wide-based styled Björk flap. Subsequent tension-free circular successive epithelialization of the tracheostoma. This was successful without any problems. Change to an 8-gauge high volume-low pressure cannula. At the end of the entire surgical procedure, another detailed discussion with the anesthesiologist in the sense of a final consultation and completion of the operation without complications.","Supraglottic laser resection, Neck dissection, PEG placement, Tracheotomy

No visible tumor parts in the magnetic resonance imaging. As already determined, there is now an indication for panendoscopy with PEG insertion and neck dissection, initially ipsilaterally. On palpation, the lump is approx. 2 cm in size, but spreads with a finger-shaped extension towards the base of the tongue or dorsal floor of the mouth.","Tracheoscopy: Entry with O° optics, inconspicuous conditions. Intubation by the surgeon, orotracheal possible without any problems. Fixation of the 6.5 mm tube. Inspection of the pharynx, oral cavity and oropharynx with the Kleinsasser size B tube. In the area of the edge of the tongue, there is a mass measuring approx. 1.5 to 2.5 mm, which extends dorsally in the shape of a finger. In the area of the right anterior palatal arch there is a conspicuous epithelial change. Performance of gastroesophagoscopy: In this case, the esophagus and stomach were unremarkable on all sides. Decision to insert a PEG tube after viewing the primary tumor. After infiltration anesthesia of the skin under strict diaphanoscopic control, a 9 Charričre PEG tube was inserted. Adequate pressure of the holding plate, sterile dressing. First looping of the tongue on the holding thread. Epithelium, disinfection of the oral cavity with Octenispet solution. Now mark the area to be resected with the electric needle. Now use the bipolar and sharp resection to successively remove the tumor macroscopically in healthy tissue, the specimen is thread-marked in 3 places for frozen section diagnostics. Here, <CLINICIAN_NAME> selectively identifies a carcinoma in situ situation in the middle of the transition area between the tongue and the floor of the mouth. Here, an entire epithelial strip is resected again, now including the sublingual gland. Parts of the lingual nerve are also resected. In addition, a disc-like resection is also obtained from the wound bed in the caudal area as a marginal sample. Hemostasis with the bipolar. Identification of the lingual artery, which is ligated and stitched twice. Adapting sutures, the wound is left to secondary wound healing. If there is no bleeding, no further measures are required. Intraoperative demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Now turn to the right palatal arch. A 2 x 2 mm large, exophytically growing change on the base of a leukoplakia can be seen here. This is now removed in healthy tissue. Several leukoplakia are also found on the alveolar ridge. The specimen is sent separately for final histological evaluation. Suspicious for precancerous lesions. Bipolar coagulation at certain points. If there is no bleeding, repeat epithelial disinfection of the entire oral cavity with Octenisept. After skin disinfection and infiltration anesthesia on the left cervical side, start with the neck dissection after skin disinfection and marking of the incisions. Slightly curved, .................... Skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid, separation of the platysma. Identification and ligation of the external jugular vein. Mobilization of the sternocleidomastoid, identification of the cervical vascular sheath with the internal jugular vein and the carotid artery. Now cranial dissection, identification of the accessorius nerve, cranial dissection up to the digastric muscle, protection of the rest of the accessorius nerve. On the digastric muscle, dissect anteriorly, detach and skeletonize the submandibular gland. Dissection of the V. facialis and the V. jugularis intera along the entire course to below the omohyoid muscle. Identification and partial dissection of the superior thyroid artery. A round, soft lymph node measuring 2 x 1.5 cm is found in the area where the V. facialis exits. This is now successively removed together with the surrounding connective tissue and level IIa is completely removed. Level Ib is also freed from connective tissue after skeletonization of the gland. The facial artery and facial vein are spared. Complete the medial neck preparation, taking away parts of the connective tissue that are above the prelaryngeal musculature. Dissection of the carotid bifurcation, identifying the cervical artery and sparing the entire cervical artery as the procedure progresses. The vagus nerve is also identified and spared. Now complete the lateral neck preparation after free preparation of the accessorius triangle and caudal preparation. Below the omohyoid, a caudal boundary to level IV is created, the sedimentation limits are defined with the bipolar and the preparation is fully developed.

Panendoscopy and CT image morphology revealed an exophytic mass in the right piriform sinus. Histologically squamous cell carcinoma, therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","Induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. Intubation via the existing tracheostoma. First of all, entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the tumor. The tumor fills the entire right piriform sinus, grows onto the medial piriform sinus wall and reaches the arytenoid cartilage, growing around the arytenoid cartilage towards the postcricoid region. The endolarynx itself is free, including the left arytenoid cartilage. Insertion of a PEG tube in the usual manner, with very good diaphanoscopy. Injection of Ultracaine/suprarenin mixture and sterile washing and draping. Placement of an apron flap in the usual manner. Neck dissection on the right. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the cervical vascular sheath. Level II shows a very large metastasis, which is successively dissected out, sparing the external and internal jugular veins, the accessorius nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. These structures can be preserved, including the facial vein. During dissection, the jugular vein is torn twice and carefully sutured over with Ethilon. Remove the remaining neck tissue from level II to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Turn to the opposite side. Here also expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the cervical vascular sheath, the submandibular gland and evacuate levels IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Sparing of the external and internal jugular, hypoglossal and accessorius nerves and the facial vein. Release of the larynx on the left side. Dissection of the thyroid gland and the cervical vascular sheath. Ligation of the upper laryngeal bundle. Detachment of the infrahyal musculature. Release and removal of the hyoid bone. Turning to the opposite side. Here, only the upper part of the larynx is detached while detaching the infrahyal muscles. The rest is left in place due to the tumor infiltration. Release of the piriform sinus on the left side. No release of the piriform sinus on the right side due to tumor infiltration. Entering the pharynx while simultaneously pulling out the epiglottis. Incision of the mucosa, initially on the left side with opening of the pharynx. Inspection of the tumor under direct vision. Here you can clearly see that the tumor infiltrates the entire wall of the piriform sinus and also reaches the posterior arytenoid cartilage. The larynx is removed with appropriate removal of pharyngeal mucosa and placed caudally. Two marginal samples are taken from the postcricoid region and the lateral pharyngeal wall. No evidence of tumor or carcinoma in situ in the frozen section. Therefore R0 situation in the frozen section. Due to the very narrow remaining mucosa (well under 6 cm), the decision was made to lift a graft. Lifting of the supraclavicular island flap by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. For this purpose, a 9x5 cm skin island is cut around the upper arm and lifted, taking the muscle fascia with it. An auxiliary incision is made in the front below the clavicle and dissected in front of and behind the clavicle. The flap is lifted with a very wide handle and is well supplied with blood during the entire dissection. Form a skin bridge towards the pharynx. Pull through the graft and insert the graft into the pharynx. Insertion of the graft into the pharynx, starting at the esophageal entrance and moving cranially. This was successful without any problems. Of course, a Provox prosthesis was inserted in the usual manner prior to insertion. A myotomy was performed in the area of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides to create a flat tracheostoma. Insertion of two Redon drainage tubes in the shoulder area and also on each side of the neck. The tracheostoma must be partially revised.

Injection, sterile washing and draping. The tumor is first inspected with the Kleinsasser tube. The tumor starts at the tonsil loge on the right side, moves caudally along the pharyngeal side wall, infiltrates the entire piriform sinus on the right side including the tip of the piriform sinus, spreads from the piriform sinus to the larynx and infiltrates the postcricoid region, pocket folds and vocal fold and also moves into the esophageal entrance via the piriform sinus. Start the operation by creating an apron flap in the usual way. Release of the larynx. Start at the hyoid bone on the left side. The hyoid bone cannot be completely detached on the right side, as the tumor is already infiltrating the hyoid bone and soft tissue on CT morphology, so half of the hyoid bone must be detached on the left side and the rest is left in situ. Release of the larynx initially on the left side. Detachment of the oblique laryngeal muscles. Removal of the piriform sinus and detachment of the thyroid gland. Also detachment of the thyroid gland on the right side. Detachment of the cervical vascular sheath from the pharynx and entry into the pharynx from the left side. Inspection of the tumor and resection of the tumor, including the lower pole of the tonsil and the entire pharyngeal wall on the right side. Removal of the larynx, including parts of the esophageal inlet. The tumor specimen is inserted en bloc into the frozen section. Macroscopically, there is a scarce resection in the area of the piriform sinus and the esophageal duct. Therefore, another resection is immediately performed here and a new marginal sample is taken. No dysplasia, no carcinoma in situ and no invasive carcinoma in the resected specimen or in the new marginal specimen. Final margin samples R0 on all sides. Inspection of the mucosa in the area of the caudal mucosal part and esophageal entrance, relatively little mucosa is present, as well as upwards towards the tonsil lobe. Intraoperative demonstration of the defect on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. A joint decision is made to insert a radialis graft. The defect is measured, 18 x 8 cm with a bulge at the tonsil lobe. This graft is lifted on the forearm by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Removal of the radialis flap. Removal of the radial graft on the right arm by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Measurement of the defect and removal of a 15 x 8 cm radialis graft from the right forearm. To do this, mark the graft and the radial artery and ulnar artery. Then angulation of the forearm and dissection without tourniquet. Cut around the graft and extend the incision to the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Exposure of the radial artery. Deposition and transposition of the radial artery after application of a vascular clamp for approx. 5 minutes. During this time, good oxygen saturation was measured on the index finger. Lift the graft from the tendons and dissect the pedicle in the usual manner up to the crook of the elbow. Dissection of the basilic vein and cephalic vein. Dissection of the venous confluence up to the deep venous system. Exposure of the interosseous artery and removal of the radial artery while preserving the interosseous artery. Removal of two superficial and two deep veins. Parallel to the harvesting, the split skin is removed from the thigh by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Now close the wound on the right forearm with the removed split skin using <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> in the usual way. Insertion of swabs and application of a dorsal forearm splint. In the meantime, the neck dissection is performed on both sides. Start on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein and the facial vein and release of the neck block II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the other side. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release the cervical vascular sheath and detach the neck preparation II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. The neck vessels are now prepared microscopically, initially on the left side. However, during preparation it becomes apparent that the vessels on the left side are not suitable for anastomosis, so the procedure is switched to the right side. Here the superior thyroid artery is prepared, the facial vein and an outlet from the facial vein and the external jugular vein. Then, after removing the radialis graft, the graft is flushed with heparin, which can be done without any problems, and then the anastomosis of the artery and the two veins is started in the usual way. Suturing of the graft initially in the area of the oropharynx. The graft was configured in such a way that the tonsil lobe was given an extra bulge in the graft, and suturing began there. Then successive suturing caudally. In the area of the esophageal opening, a V-shaped esophageal opening plasty must be performed. To do this, a myotomy is performed on the dorsolateral side on the left and a slightly paramedian incision is made in the esophageal entrance on the right to create a V-shaped defect. The radial flap is inserted into this V-shaped defect like a jigsaw puzzle. Several sutures are placed and the graft is fixed in place with inverting sutures. Finally, the graft is completely sutured into place. A monitor was not used as the graft is too large to shorten the stalk any further and the flap can also be easily checked in the tonsil lodge by direct inspection. At the end, insertion of a Redon drain on the left side and a flap on the right side. Fold back the apron flap. Incision of the tracheostoma and two-layer wound closure. At the end, control Doppler sonography in the area of the flap stalk. Good Doppler signal and marking of the flap pedicle. The patient goes to the intensive care unit ventilated. Please carry out post-operative flap checks according to the usual schedule. Continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours, preferably longer. X-ray emulsion at the earliest on the 12th postoperative day. Please consult the surgeon beforehand.  ","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation transnasally by the anesthesia colleagues. Sterile washing and draping. Now entering with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the tumor. As described above, the tumor is located at the base of the tongue on the right side with transition to the left side and is very large in size and CT morphologically also infiltrates the inner muscles of the tongue and infiltrates the hyoid bone. Then looping of the tongue and insertion of a covered retractor. Pre-luxation of the tongue in this way and also with the Kleinsasser tube it is not possible to expose the tumor transorally. It is therefore decided to perform the complete tumor resection transcervically. For this purpose, an apron flap is created in the usual manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. A lymph node was removed externally in level II. Massive scarring down to the accessorius nerve and the internal jugular vein. The accessory nerve has completely disappeared in a scar block, the internal jugular vein, the accessory nerve and the hypoglossal nerve can only be separated from the scar block with great effort. This also results in tearing of the facial vein, which is also located in the scar block area and must be ligated and removed. Now remove the neck block IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. There are several suspicious lymph nodes in levels IIa and b and also macroscopically suspicious lymph nodes in the other regions III and IV; all levels are sent individually to the pathology department. Neck dissection left <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Locate the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and expose it. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle to the cranial side of the digaster muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Locate the gl. submandibularis and expose the gland. Fold up the gland and expose the digaster muscle. Locate the VJI and dissect the large anterior jugular vein. Dissect the JVJ from cranial to caudal. The outlet to the facial vein is bypassed. Locate and preserve the hypoglossal nerve. Removal of the medial neck preparation. Now dissect the lateral neck preparation and remove it while sparing the plexus branches. Finally, a supraclavicular lymph node is successively dissected out. No increased bleeding, no chyle. Now measurement of the defect 12 x 6 x 5 cm. In the meantime, marginal samples were taken from the specimen itself and sent to the pathology department. All margin samples on the specimen were R0, therefore no resection necessary. The graft is now marked on the forearm and the skin incision is made. Then visualization of the vein situation in the crook of the elbow. Visualization of the venous confluence. Visualization of the brachialis muscle, visualization of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Exposure of the radial artery. Now take over the graft elevation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Detachment of the graft from the vein bed. Exposure of the pedicle in the usual manner. Outlets are clipped. Then take over <CLINICIAN_NAME> again and place the graft in the crook of the elbow. Two superficial veins and one deep vein are lifted. The graft is then sutured into the defect. This is somewhat difficult as the defect extends into the oral cavity area in the floor of the mouth and ends at the vallecula. In the end, the graft is sutured in completely. The vessels are then exposed on the right side. Here the superior thyroid artery is used as the connecting vessel and 2 outlets from the internal jugular vein in the distal area. All vessels are anastomosed. The veins are couplerized. There is good graft perfusion. At the end, the tracheotomy is performed and the apron flap is sutured in place. Before this, 2 Redon drains were inserted. The procedure is completed without complications. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Regular flap control according to the usual schedule and presentation of the patient at the tumor conference after final histology to plan adjuvant radiochemotherapy. The patient has already verbally agreed to adjuvant radiochemotherapy in advance.","Resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), PEG placement, Tracheotomy, Panendoscopy

Therefore indication for the above-mentioned operation. Due to the patient's express refusal to have a PEG tube inserted, a nasogastric feeding tube was placed.","Pharyngoscopy is performed first: A rather superficial, exulcerated mass is seen, which completely occupies the anterior palatal arch and widens slightly towards the soft palate. It then spreads a few mm over the tonsillar lobe and the glossotonsillar groove to the base of the tongue and towards the posterior border of the tongue. The posterior palatal arch is also partially affected and laterally the tumor extends almost to the retromolar region. The tumor is now resected with the electric needle at a distance of approx. 1 cm so that the anterior palatal arch is completely resected and the anterior side of the posterior palatal floor is also resected at the mucosal level. The uvula and the posterior side of the posterior palatal arch can be left in place. Laterally, the resection extends to the retromolar region. In the deep region, both the constrictor pharyngis muscle and part of the palatal musculature can be preserved. For this reason, good swallowing function is expected here after demonstration of the findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and reconstruction is dispensed with. Further caudally, the resection now includes the posterior part of the floor of the mouth and the edge of the tongue and then the resection is connected to the lateral oropharynx via the base of the tongue. Care is taken to ensure that sufficient distance to the tumor is maintained in the area of the deep tonsil lobe. Intermediate hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. An arterial vessel is stitched with 3.0 Vicryl RB1 suture. At the end, flushing with hydrogen and Ringer and renewed hemostasis. The frozen section examination reveals suspected mild dysplasia at the cranial edge of the palatal arch and CIS in the area of the anterior edge of the tongue. For this reason, a larger resection in the area of the tongue margin and a smaller, relatively superficial marginal resection in the area of the palatal floor are removed. Both are sent for frozen section diagnostics and are found to be free of tumor and dysplasia. This results in an R0 resection of a cT2 cN0 oropharyngeal carcinoma of the tonsillar lobe, the palatal arches and the base of the tongue. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit tracheotomized for monitoring and is to receive a further 3 days of antibiotics. The tracheostomy should be removed one week postoperatively after the swallowing attempt. The patient should not be fed transorally for one week. <CLINICIAN_NAME> - Neck dissection on both sides: repositioning of the patient to perform a neck dissection on the right side.

After an initial suspected diagnosis of peritonsillitis, a G2 differentiated squamous cell carcinoma was confirmed during a panendoscopy. CT scan showed an extension of a cT2 cN2c oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left side with an unclear mass in the left lower lobe.","First, perform the PEG insertion. For this purpose, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. Here, with good diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and placement of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. Now turn to pharyngoscopy and initially transoral tumor resection. The left tonsil is clearly thickened, bulging, with central endophytic changes and otherwise exophytic parts. On palpation, it is noticeable that the tumor infiltrates the entire left soft palate submucosally from the tonsillar lobe, reaches hard to the hard palate border, extends to parauvular. Clearly infiltrates the posterior palatal arch. Here too, firm adherence to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Also submucosal growth through the soft palate towards the nasopharynx. Here, palpation and inspection reveal a free tubal bulge. The glossotonsillar groove is slightly raised but not infiltrated. The tumor is also adjacent to the alveolar ridge. Overall, absolutely immobile, almost completely submucosal tumor growth. The tumor is now resected using an electric needle and a dissection technique, subtotal resection of the soft palate to the right side, clearly parauvular. Resection up to the hard palate at the alveolar process, clear adherence in the area of the hard palate, therefore a small piece of bone is chiseled off here, but no signs of infiltration. Now resection of the soft palate. Overview of the growth towards the posterior pharyngeal wall and nasopharynx. Tumor growth to below the tubal bulge. Submucosal. Now resection to the buccal side and onto the alveolar ridge. Exposure of the ascending mandibular branch. Here also clear adherence but no infiltration, sharp incision of the periosteum here and pushing off with the raspatory. No evidence of osseous tumor infiltration here, visualization of the medial pterygoid, a clear displacement layer is now visible here, clearly no infiltration of the muscle, tumor can now be completely detached here. Resection cranially to below the tubal bulge, dorsally the resection extends to approximately the middle of the posterior pharyngeal wall, here at least 1 to 1.5 cm safety margin on all sides in the mucosal area. Preservation of the prevertebral fascia. Inclusion of a circumscribed tongue cuff with inclusion of the glossotonsillar groove, here a small tumor extension is visible towards the posterior floor of the mouth, this is also resected. Resection up to the submandibular gland. Due to the tight conditions here and in the area of the lateral pharyngeal wall with a palpable styloid process in clear proximity to the tumor, the decision was made to proceed further transcervically to secure the vessels. Taking marginal samples in the area of the entire soft palate and buccally. Also take a marginal sample in the direction of the nasopharynx. All marginal samples are tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Therefore, repositioning for transcervical tumor resection. First perform the neck dissection on the left side. To do this, make a skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and the auricularis magnus nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. A macroscopically clearly enlarged lymph node measuring approx. 1 x 2 cm can be seen at the posterior edge of the gland. Exposure of the entire length of the digastric muscle. Identification of the accessorius nerve. Now remove the anterior neck preparation, carefully preserving the cervical artery, the superior thyroid artery, the facial vein and the hypoglossal nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Here, conspicuous lymph nodes at the transition from level III to IV. Dissection of the vein, removal of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Evacuation of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Minutious hemostasis. Caudal no evidence of lymphatic leakage. En bloc removal of the neck dissectate. Now turn to level Ib subcapsular excision of the gland, removal of the nodes in level Ib with careful protection. After visualization of the ramus marginalis mandibulae, removal of the nodes with gland. Now complete exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, resection of the digastric muscle, pharyngotomy is also performed by resecting the gland. Exposure of the carotid artery with the exit of the superior thyroid artery, the facial artery and the lingual artery. A branch of the facial artery and the lingual artery must be cut off. Laborious preservation of the facial artery. After exposing the carotid artery, expose the styloid process. Now a good overview of further tumor growth. In the case of tumor cones towards the floor of the mouth, the gland and the submandibular tissue as well as parts of the mylohyoid muscle are involved. Significant basal resection. This creates a wide safety margin in the cervical direction. After securing the vessels, the tumor can now be easily removed in the area of the pharyngeal side wall. After macroscopic examination of the tumor specimen, the macroscopic examination of the specimen in the area of the floor of the mouth revealed a scarce situation, but a tumor surrounded by a soft tissue margin. A pharyngotomy was carried out here for further resection. Also a close resection. Here non in sano resection in the area of the cranial oropharyngeal posterior wall or towards the nasopharynx. Due to the tumor progression shown on the entire specimen, generous resection in the area of the cranial oropharyngeal side wall and towards the nasopharynx. Otherwise, macroscopically clear in sano resection on all sides of the specimen with almost completely submucosal tumor growth as described above. The frozen section diagnosis now confirms the macroscopic assessment of a circumscribed basal scarce R0 situation in the area of the cranial oropharynx. Tumor margin forming here, but with free resectate. In addition, a very narrow basal resection margin is seen parauvularly, otherwise confirmation of the R0 resection. A generous resection of the entire soft palate is now performed transorally, resulting in total resection of the soft palate up to the right-sided tonsil lobe. This is diagnosed as completely tumor-free in the frozen section diagnosis. After exposing the defect, which now extends around the entire soft palate to the buccal, posterior floor of the mouth, tongue edge and oropharyngeal side wall, a transplant measuring approx. 11 x 6 cm in total is measured and adapted to the soft palate situation. In parallel, the radialis graft is lifted from the right and the neck dissection and the sonographically described intraparotid mass are performed. Intraoperative discussion of findings and sonography with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First carry out the neck dissection. To do this, make an incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, extending it preauricularly, and cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Cut through the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and the auricularis magnus nerve, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Identification of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the cervical sinus, the hypoglossal nerve and the facial vein. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and clearing of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches, overall significantly more difficult preparation conditions due to the simultaneous surgical procedure. Now placement of a parotid lobule anteriorly. Preservation of the auricular nerve, a well-defined lesion can now be palpated at the caudal pole of the gland. Superficial and caudal location, therefore decision to perform extracapsular dissection. Resection of the mass with surrounding glandular mantle in toto, macroscopically most likely corresponding to a cystadenolymphoma independent of the tumor. The facial nerve can be stimulated in depth without any problems. However, there is no exposure of nerve branches at any point. Careful wound inspection. Meticulous hemostasis and, after wound inspection and irrigation, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Now turn to lifting the radialis graft. After marking the graft, apply the tourniquet. Cut around the double-bellied graft. Exposure and entrainment of the cephalic vein. Exposure of the superficial radial ramus. Strict subfacial dissection. Exposure of the peripheral vascular pedicle after peripheral removal of the cephalic vein. Separation of the radial vascular pedicle after ligation. Careful subfacial dissection. Meticulous protection of the vascular pedicle. Lifting of the graft using a small muscle cup in the area of the vascular pedicle with adherence up to the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the vascular situation. Exposure of the emergence of the anterior interosseous artery, exposure and securing of the ulnar artery, which is very strong. Exposure of a strong venous vascular bridge between the deep radial venous system and the superficial subcutaneous venous system. Reliable and safe elevation of the cephalic vein is therefore possible. Dissection of the vein up to the crook of the elbow. Isolate a double-headed venous vascular pedicle here. After careful clipping of all outgoing vessels, isolate the radial artery and the superficial venous outflow. Reopening of the tourniquet. Excellent hand and graft perfusion. Minutious hemostasis and, if flap vitality is excellent, removal of the graft after ligation. Preservation of the anterior interosseous artery. Now careful wound inspection, final hemostasis and careful two-layer wound closure and incorporation of the full-thickness skin graft from the groin. Finally, the wound is dressed with a vacuum dressing and a Cramer splint. Due to the good visibility of the graft, a monitor was not used in favor of the lifting defect in the arm area. Full-thickness skin graft from the groin. After marking a full-thickness skin graft measuring approx. 13 x 6 cm in a spindle shape. Cut through the skin and lift the graft strictly cutaneously. Final thinning with scissors. Careful subcutaneous mobilization on all sides and, after careful hemostasis, careful two-layer wound closure after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain with moderate tension ratios. In the meantime, as with the tumor resection, a tracheostomy was performed due to cuff insufficiency. For this purpose, the tracheostomy was performed approx. 1 cm below the cricoid cartilage and the skin and subcutaneous tissue were cut. Cut through the infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Subsequently, initially problem-free transfer to an LI tube. Then reintubation onto an 8-gauge cannula with inner core and suturing of the cannula. The radialis graft is now inserted. To do this, first place sutures in the area of the nasopharynx and in the area of the dorsal soft palate or the soft hard palate border and suture in the area of the right tonsil lobe. Pulling through the graft, suturing to the sutures provided. The graft can now be easily folded over to create a neo-soft palate. Good fit of the graft, reconstruction also in the area of the cheek and in the area of the alveolar ridge, suturing in the area of the tongue. With intact conditions on all sides, completion of the transcervical suture. Suture in the area of the tongue edge and the pharyngeal side wall. Finally, intact and tight conditions on all sides. Further transoral check of the suture. Here too, very good fit and, with intact conditions, now turning to microvascular anastomosis. Preparation of the pedicle vessels. Then preparation of the cervical vessels. This reveals a relatively weak superior thyroid artery, hence preparation of the facial artery, which is stronger but has a somewhat unfavorable course. Therefore, the artery is traced, the artery is removed after free dissection and beaten caudally. Despite a significantly stronger facial artery with a moderate caliber jump, the arterial anastomosis is now performed with 8.0 ethilon. This is extremely difficult due to the positioning of the vessels and the different vessel diameters. Successive adjustment of the vessel edges. After reopening the Acland clamp, immediate regular perfusion with immediate regular venous flow, tight arterial conditions, regular graft perfusion. Then prepare for venous anastomosis. To do this, remove the strong facial vein after ligation. Thrombosis is evident here, therefore clean the facial vein and shorten it back with now free conditions and regular venous bleeding. Performing the anastomosis with the Coupler 4.0, which is somewhat more difficult due to the vulnerable vessel wall of the facial vein. After performing the coupler anastomosis, there is a leak in the area of the venous anastomosis, which cannot be fixed with sutures. The venous anastomosis is therefore cut out with the coupler. Rerouting of the anastomosis also with Coupler 4.0. Now intact conditions and regular venous outflow. After reopening the artery, regular circulation and excellent perfusion of the graft. Final positioning of the vascular pedicle even with closure of the wound surfaces, no torsion. Therefore, after multiple wound inspections with good flap perfusion, insertion of a long rubber flap with caudal drainage and careful two-layer wound closure with residual cervical opening for hematoma prophylaxis caudally. Intraoperatively, the patient repeatedly experienced diffuse and increased bleeding tendencies, which could, however, be well controlled conservatively and surgically. The patient was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation. Conclusion: Extensive and highly aggressive cT3 cN2c G2 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left due to submucosal and infiltrative growth. Due to the intraoperative extension and the extensive submucosal growth, adjuvant radiochemotherapy is certainly urgently required here, also due to the interoperative R0 situation. Postoperatively, please monitor the flap meticulously by inspecting the pharynx. Postoperatively, a round gruel swallow should be performed on the 8th postoperative day. Depending on the swallowing function, decannulation can be performed promptly if necessary. Secondary findings: smooth and macroscopically rather benign mass of the right parotid gland.","TU resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Flap coverage (Radial), Extracapsular dissection of right parotid, Tracheotomy, PEG placement

After appropriate diaphanoscopy, the PEG can be placed and fixed in the usual way without any problems. Subsequent transition to tumor resection. After appropriate adjustment, the tongue is dislocated to the left and the tumor is resected with the monopolar caustic at an appropriate safety distance. The final examination reveals a tumor that has been removed from all sides in healthy tissue. Only laterally does the mucosa appear somewhat questionable. Therefore, another resection is performed laterally. Subsequently, circular margin sections are taken from the wound area, which are found to be R0 by frozen section histology. A complete R0 resection can therefore be assumed. The neck is then dissected on the left side. Here, regions I to V are completely removed while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. There is no clinical evidence of a suspicious cervical lymph node metastasis anywhere. Subsequent transition to the right side. Here too, the same procedure with the same findings. In addition, the predictable defect is created enorally during the submandibulectomy. Dissection of the tendons of the digastric muscle and skeletonization of the hypoglossal nerve. A large caliber facial vein is available for venous anastomosis, which is ligated accordingly. The facial artery is also suitable for anastomosis, as both the lingual artery and the superior thyroid artery are very small in caliber. A Redon and suction drain is then placed in the left side of the neck and the skin is closed in several layers. Removal of an 8.5 x 8 cm split-thickness skin graft from the left thigh. Sterile wound dressing. After removal of the radial flap graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, it is sutured into the mouth by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and the stalk is passed outwards into the neck. The patient is then handed over to <CLINICIAN_NAME> . Now lift the radialis graft on the left side. Marking of the graft, palpation of the radial artery and ulnar artery. Marking of the course and also marking of the cephalic vein, which unfortunately runs extremely far laterally and cannot be integrated into the graft. Then creation of the tourniquet and cutting around the graft and extension into the forearm as far as the elbow. Then expose the brachioradialis muscle, expose the venous star, expose the confluence, which is extremely small. Exposure of the superficial ramus, the radial nerve with 3 branches, all 3 branches can be preserved. Exposure of the radial artery with accompanying veins. Clamping and transection of the radial artery, then lifting of the radial flap from the tendon bed. Dissection of the pedicle up to the elbow and removal of the radial artery graft, taking 2 veins with it, a superficial vein and a deep vein including confluence. The arm is then covered in the usual way with split skin from the right thigh and a dorsal forearm splint is applied. The graft was sutured in place by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Then anastomosis of the radial artery with the facial artery and two veins to 2 branches of the facial vein. After connection of the flap, relatively heavy bleeding occurs from the flap vessel, which runs penetrating through the tunnel into the neck. The flap must then be detached again at the tip of the tongue. An open outlet can now be discovered in the area of the radial artery, which is clipped. This stops the bleeding. Refixation of the flap. Insertion of a Redon drainage (Jackson-Pratt) and two-layer wound closure. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient goes to the intensive care unit intubated and ventilated. Please continue antibiotics for 24 hours postoperatively, longer if necessary. Flap checks, Hb checks according to the usual schedule.","Right partial tongue resection, Selective neck dissection

This shows a deep infiltration, so that a hemiglossectomy is necessary with subsequent flap coverage.","First reclination of the head, opening of the mouth with a mouth retractor, tongue lashing. Remove the carcinoma with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm to 2 cm on all sides. For this purpose, resection of the left side of the tongue except for a small remnant at the tip of the tongue up to the midline, dorsally, caudally up to and including parts of the base of the tongue. To the side, resection of parts of the floor of the mouth. Partial resection of the lingual nerve and the sublingual gland as well as the wharton duct. Resection extends dorsally to the tonsil region. Preparation goes to the frozen section. Here, all margins are in the healthy area, thus R0 resection. Rearrangement for neck dissection on the left: First disinfect the skin. Injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. Start with the left side. Curved skin incision. Exposure of sternocleidomastoid muscle anterior margin. Dissection of fat lymph node package from the muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, internal/external carotid artery. Visualization of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Then develop the dorsal neck preparation while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Then develop the anterior neck preparation while exposing and preserving the superior thyroid artery and the lingual artery. Due to the resection of the wharton's duct, the submandibular gland with attached level b lymph nodes is also removed. In this case, the branch of the mouth is exposed in a short section. Finally, careful hemostasis. Irrigation of the wound area. This results in a neck dissection II-IV. Neck dissection on the right: Here the operation is performed as on the opposite side, but only level II and III evacuation with preservation of all structures as on the opposite side. Enlarged lymph nodes on both sides can be removed. Supraomohyoid neck dissection on the right due to cN0 status on ultrasound. Then measurement of the defect in the area of the tongue and floor of the mouth. Flap size resulted in 10 x 5.5 cm. The radial flap is then removed: mark the flap in the appropriate size. Apply the tourniquet after unwrapping the arm. Then cut around the flap subfascially from the ulnar side, later from the radial side. Incision curved towards the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the superficial venous system. This consists of several veins which open into the cephalic vein. This shows 2 ends. The brachioradialis muscle is then shown, with the pedicle below. Distal exposure of the radial artery. This is severed and supplied with prolene using 4-0 stitches. Distal also anti-shear suture on the flap. Successive lifting of the flap under its vascular pedicle. Outgoing vessels are clipped or bipolar coagulated. Dissection successively in the direction of the olecranon. The connection between the surface and deep venous system can be visualized and preserved. The radial artery is very thin-lumened overall, the connection to the brachial artery is very far cranial. Beforehand, the interosseous artery is severed and ligated. Very very thin radial vein, which is not suitable as an anastomosis. Very thick brachial and ulnar arteries. Finally releasing tourniquet. There is a good hyperperfusion phenomenon of the flap. However, blood flow starts with some delay, so the flap is initially left in situ to prevent reperfusion ischemia. In the meantime, the neck was dissected on the right side. The flap is now removed and the veins and artery ligated using a puncture ligature and clip. Two large connecting veins and the very small radial vein can be removed, as well as a relatively small radial artery. Now suture the flap into the defect: To do this, create a 2-3 QF wide tunnel from the oral cavity to the left cervical. To do this, cut the digastric muscle which is coagulated in a bipolar fashion. Then pull the pedicle through into the neck. Care is taken to ensure that it does not ..................................... The flap is successively worked into the defect without tension using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. The vessels are then conditioned. The superior thyroid artery, which has a similarly thick lumen as the radial artery, is treated first. The lingual artery is also dissected. First anastomosis of the radial artery with the superior thyroid artery after conditioning of the vessels. Suture with Ethilon 9-0 sutures. After opening the clamps, initially good perfusion with good venous return. In the course, however, insufficient perfusion and undescribed venous return. The anastomosis was therefore opened and checked. No thrombosis. Repeated suturing with Ethilon 9-0 sutures. Then open the clamp again. Here too, completely insufficient arterial flow and venous return. Doppler signals equally unconvincing. Clamping of the superior thyroid artery again and opening of the suture. No thrombosis recognizable here either. The decision was made to use the prepared lingual artery, which had to be severed anyway, as a bleeding prophylaxis for the anastomosis. The lingual artery is placed in a high position here and ligated cranially. The lingual artery is now conditioned and sutured to the newly conditioned radial artery, whereby the radial artery must be cut open narrowly due to the differences in lumen. Suture with 9-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, strong arterial flow and good venous return are restored. The facial vein and the larger part of the cephalic vein are now conditioned. After conditioning and measuring the vessels, a size 3 coupler is selected. This is used in the typical manner. The vessels are stretched over the silicone pins. After the coupler is closed, however, the pin gets between the silicone rings and the metal pin is pressed into the vessel. The vessels are conditioned again and the coupler is reinserted in the same way as size 3. The coupler is finally successfully placed by applying pressure from the outside to the .......................... After opening the clamps, good venous flow, positive smear phenomenon. Another coupler anastomosis is performed with a larger vein, which is also in contact with the internal jugular vein. Coupler size also 3.0. Here too, pressure must be applied to the coupler externally to prevent the bolt from drifting through the silicone rings. Good venous return here too, positive smear phenomenon. Subsequent careful irrigation and hemostasis. Final view shows good arterial perfusion and venous return, flap vital and well perfused. Wound closure in layers on both sides of the neck and insertion of a Redon drain in each case. Anastomosis region marked externally using suture. The forearm is closed using skin removed from the right side of the groin: First mark the 10 x 6 cm groin skin. Remove the skin as a full-thickness skin graft. After mobilization of the skin edges and careful hemostasis, layered wound closure of the fatty skin and also the groin skin using 3-0 Vicryl, 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Ethilon back-stitch sutures with insertion of a Redon drainage. Finally, sterile dressing. Then incorporation of the full-thickness skin into the defect. The wound is closed cranially in a typical layered manner. Then apply a hydrogel Mepilex dressing. Compresses are loosely applied over this. The hand is then fixed to a Cramer splint using an elastic bandage. Finally, tracheotomy: small Kocher collar incision due to the severe swelling with the tongue protruding from the mouth area. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. After spreading these, the thyroid isthmus is exposed. This is passed underneath, severed after clamping and treated with puncture ligatures. The trachea is then exposed. A free-stemmed Björk flap is created in the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Epithelialization of this. Subsequent insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. Re-intubation. Tracheal cannula is fixed with sutures. ......................plast dressing on puncture sites. Redon, otherwise no dressing and no cannula tape. Check the flap again enorally, it is vital. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue the antibiotic treatment started intraoperatively for 2-3 days. Also continue the heparin perfusor therapy started intraoperatively with 500 E/h for a total of 5 days. Regular checks of the flap or Doppler sono checks according to the schedule. PEG placement was attempted intraoperatively, but this measure was not possible in the absence of diaphanoscopy.

Surgical treatment desired by the patient was discussed with the patient until flap coverage if required. CT shows tonsillar carcinoma on the left side in the wall area, which appears to be relatively well encapsulated.","Pharyngoscopy is now performed. Palpation of the tonsil tumor, which is mobile. Based on the palpation findings and the CT findings, the decision is made to attempt a transoral resection. PEG placement: insertion of the flexible esophagoscope and advancement into the stomach. There, after creating a spontaneous diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm stomach wall tube without any problems or complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Now insertion of the McIvor spatula. The tumor is macroscopically incised on all sides at a distance of 1 to 1.5 cm, including deep resection of parts of the pharyngeal wall. Fat is partially visible, but relatively far cranially and towards the lower jaw. The posterior palatal arch can be completely preserved, the anterior palatal arch falls away, parts of the base of the tongue fall away, resection reaches just to the beginning of the hypopharynx. The specimen is removed in toto and marked with a suture. Caudally, a marginal sample of tongue base mucosa, tongue base soft tissue and soft tissue of the pharyngeal wall is taken, as the borders to the tumor appear somewhat narrow here. In the frozen section, the tumor also extends just to the caudal margins. In conjunction with the marginal specimen, however, this is an R0 situation. Therefore, no flap coverage is necessary if the wall is still intact. Transfer to neck dissection on both sides: First inject a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into the sides of the neck on both sides. Start with neck dissection on the left: curved, submandibular skin incision. Exposure of sternocleidomastoid muscle anterior border, exposure of omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein, internal/external carotid artery, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Successive development of the dorsal neck preparation. The larger, cystic lymph node metastasis is removed in a block with the other lymph nodes. Levels V b and V a are also removed while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. The lymph nodes are then removed from the anterior neck preparation or revision level I b. This also includes exposure of the submandibular gland and removal of the capsule. The facial vein is exposed and preserved, as are the superior thyroid artery and vein. This ultimately results in removal of level I b to V. This is followed by careful hemostasis. Irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain. Then neck dissection on the right side: here, as on the opposite side, the levels II to IV are evacuated in a typical manner with exposure of the corresponding structures, as on the opposite side. Finally, careful irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution and hemostasis. Wound closure in layers and insertion of a Redon drainage. Due to the relatively extensive defect and the involvement of the base of the tongue, the decision was made to perform a temporary protective tracheotomy. A small Kocher collar incision was made. Subsequent dissection through subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature. Spreading of these. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped off, severed and supplied by means of puncture ligatures. Subsequent exposure of the trachea. Between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage a small, broadly pedunculated Björk flap. This is epithelized in a typical manner. Finally, insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. The procedure was completed without complications. Thoracic inspection revealed no signs of bleeding at the end of the operation. Patient admitted to the intensive care unit for 1 night for monitoring. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube for 1 week, followed by gradual diet build-up. Presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference to discuss adjuvant therapy.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement

CT shows infiltration in the direction of the hyoid bone or thyroid cartilage in depth, therefore no laser resection. Tip of piriform sinus and esophageal entrance free. The preliminary examinations show the possibility of a radial lobe. Therefore, the above mentioned surgery is indicated.","First of all, another laryngoscopy and pharyngoscopy: The tumor in the area of the piriform sinus anterior wall, which is very difficult to adjust and evaluate, is revealed. This confirms the indication. The patient is transferred for neck dissection and tumor resection. First radical neck dissection on the right: typical skin incision. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle anterior margin and dissection of the lymph node fat package. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. A large lymph node metastasis is visible. This can be dissected from the internal and external carotid artery, as well as from the vagus nerve. The accessorius nerve runs into the node, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is also infiltrated and the internal jugular vein. Therefore, ablation of the internal jugular vein caudally and cranially, resection of the accessory nerve and resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve and superior thyroid artery. Inclusion of the capsule of the submandibular gland and surrounding nodes from level Ib. This results in an overall removal of level Ib and II to V. Now tumor resection: Entry into the pharynx at the level of the hyoid bone. For this purpose, the hyoid bone is first skeletonized and resected laterally over an area of 2/3 of the right half. The resection extends downwards to the tip of the piriform sinus. The aryepiglottic fold and parts of the postcricoid mucosa are resected medially. The tumor is thread-marked. A marginal sample is also taken from the cranial side and also sent to the frozen section marked with a thread. In the caudal frozen section, there is still carcinoma in situ in the margin. Therefore, another resection of a wide mucosal strip from the area from the arytenoid fold to the posterior wall of the hypopharynx is performed in this area. This is followed by another corresponding margin sample. This goes to the frozen section. No more tumor infiltrates here. Therefore, R0 resection can now be assumed. Now modified radical neck dissection on the left side: skin incision as on the opposite side. Exposure of fat lymph node package. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein and its preservation. Exposure of the internal and external carotid artery, superior thyroid artery, hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Development of the dorsal neck preparation while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. The anterior neck preparation is removed, taking the submandibular gland capsule with it. This results in a level II to V evacuation. Subsequent tracheostoma creation: small Kocher collar incision. This is done in the area of the old scar. Exposure through scar tissue up to the thyroid gland. Apparently previous resection on the left. Isthmus is cut again and pushed to the side. Trachea is opened in the 1st/2nd intercartilaginous space. Small, broadly pedicled, modified Björk flap. Epithelialization of this in a typical manner. Insertion of a laryngectomy tube. Then elevation of the forearm flap from the left side: marking of the flap in a size of 8 x 6 cm. Mark the skin monitor. Angulate the arm and apply the tourniquet. Cut around the flap, initially close to the ulnar side. Here also expose the ulnar artery, then also radially. On the radial side, include the cephalic vein, which is contained in the subcutaneous tissue to the skin monitor. The radial artery is placed caudally and supplied with puncture ligatures. The flap is lifted subfascially with the pedicle in a typical manner. Small outgoing vessels are clipped. Connection of superficial/deep venous system in the elbow. Exposure of the outlet of the interosseous artery as well as the confluence and 2nd vein outlet. Deposition of the flap in the area of the cephalic vein, confluence and in front of the outlet of the interosseous artery. The artery is supplied with puncture ligatures. Flap vessels are flushed with heparin. A piece of full-thickness skin of the appropriate size is removed from the groin. After mobilizing the skin, the groin is closed in layers in a typical low-tension manner with the insertion of a Redon drain. Full-thickness skin is sutured into the defect in the forearm area and the forearm area is closed in layers in a cranial direction. A Vacuseal dressing and a stretcher splint are then applied. Suturing of the flap: The flap is sutured into the defect without tension using 3/0 Vicryl in single button sutures after sutures have been placed using the appropriate technique. The sutures are conditioned in each case. The superior thyroid artery is sutured to the radial artery using 8/0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good flow and good venous re-flow. The cephalic vein is connected to the external jugular vein with a 3/0 coupler after measuring. The medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve is connected to the superior laryngeal nerve with Ethilon 9/0 single button sutures to sensitize the flap. This is carried out after the nerve endings have been freshened. Final inspection shows good skin perfusion, good arterial flow, good venous return. The right side of the neck is closed by inserting the skin monitor. A Redon drain is also inserted here, which is secured with a suture. After irrigation, the left side of the neck is closed in layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. Laryngectomy tube is replaced by a cannula with a core, which is secured with sutures. The procedure is completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Heparin perfusor started intraoperatively at 500 units per hour should be continued for 5 days. Antibiotics started preoperatively should be continued for 1 week. Postoperative feeding of the patient via PEG tube. Build up diet after swallowing porridge, from the 10th postoperative day at the earliest. Please check the flap postoperatively according to the schedule using Doppler and checking the skin monitor.  ","Resection and Neck dissection

A submucosally altered tumorous formation was found in the left tonsil region, extending superficially to the edge and base of the tongue. The caudal end of the tumor is difficult to adjust; in any case, it extends beyond the tonsillar lobe to the level of the upper edge of the epiglottis and the entrance to the piriform sinus. Adjustment of the larynx and the hypopharynx and piriform sinus on the right side and also the larynx on the left side as well as the posterior pharyngeal wall, posterior hypopharyngeal wall are free. Start with transoral tumor resection. It is marked with the monopolar needle on the anterior palatal arch and incised. Then further dissection with scissors so that a wide safety margin is created. The tonsil is completely removed together with the surrounding tissue, mucosa and muscles down to the base of the tongue. The tumor resection must then be interrupted as it is no longer clear and the patient is moved to the neck dissection on the left side. Start of neck dissection on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Locating the accessorius nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of levels II a, III, IV and V. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and digastric muscle. Dissection of the digastric muscle. Removal of the submandibular gland and pushing aside the stylohyoid muscle. Push aside and partially sever the muscles of the floor of the mouth. Then blunt entry into the oropharynx. This is successful without any problems. The tumor can be palpated and inspected. Enlargement of the pharyngostomy and further removal of the tumor via the transcervical approach. This is relatively difficult as the hypoglossal nerve runs to the tongue in this area, but must of course be preserved. With the help of <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the last remnant of the tumor is removed while preserving the hypoglossal nerve. The tumor specimen is thread-marked and sent for histological examination. It can be resected in a frozen section R0. Then complete the neck dissection on the left side and turn to the opposite side. Analogous procedure here. Expose the sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid, digastric and submandibular gland. Clearing of levels II to V a while sparing the plexus branches and exposing the cervical vascular sheath and free preparation of the internal jugular vein. The radialis graft is lifted at the same time. According to the previously performed measurements, an 11 x 8 cm graft is drawn on the left forearm, then the skin is incised. The brachioradialis muscle is exposed. The superficial ramus of the radial nerve is located and visualized, including its branches. Locate and visualize a large vein of the superficial venous system median to the forearm. Locate and expose the radial artery. Clamping and ligation of the radial artery. The pulse oximetry measurement indicates good blood flow to the hand via the ulnar artery. Dissection down to the tendon layer so that the paratendineum is just preserved. Lift the graft from the tendon layer. Then switch to the ulnar side and also develop the flap while preserving the paratendineum of the forearm tendons. Dissection of a long pedicle, preserving a superficial vein and at least one vein ................................................. of the radial artery. The branches are bipolarized and clipped. Dissection of the pedicle up to the crook of the elbow. Dissection of the venous plexus and removal of the specimen with removal of the radial artery and two large-lumen veins. The graft is then fitted into the defect. This is difficult due to the hypoglossal nerve. Incision of the graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who carefully sutures the graft first from the transcervical and then from the transoral or alternating sides. At the same time, the split skin on the right thigh is lifted. Unfortunately, this is also very difficult as there is a technical defect in the dermatome and the knife is also not sharp. Unfortunately, this results in a very large wound area, which is, however, adequately treated afterwards. The arm is closed parallel to the incision in the usual way. First, the upper part of the forearm is sutured in two layers. Then retaining sutures in the defect area. Application of the split skin, which had to be mixed in this case, and suturing of the split skin as well as a Mepilex wound dressing and application of a dorsal forearm splint. Then the anastomosis was applied. First, the arterial vessels are prepared in both the donor and recipient areas and then successively anastomosed using a vascular suture. Turning to the veins. These are also dissected in both the recipient and donor areas and then anastomosed using two couplers. The superior thyroid artery is used for the arterial limb.

Then insertion of the mouth retractor and inspection of the tumor region. An exophytic tumor is found on the right tonsil with transition to the anterior palatal arch. First mark the edges of the incision with the monopolar needle, then incise the mucosa on the anterior palatal arch with the monopolar needle. Continue the incision with the scissors and bipolar forceps, initially on the anterior palatal arch. Then release the tumor preparation at the upper pole. Then dissection at the base of the wound with spreading of the muscles and bipolar coagulation using the dissection technique. Release at the posterior palatal arch.

Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation and insertion of hydrogen compresses. Suture marking of the tumor specimen and sending for frozen section. Unfortunately, carcinoma in situ with tumor infiltration is still found on the anterior palatal arch in the frozen section, so a resection is taken from there and a marginal sample is sent to the frozen section again. No more tumor infiltrates can be found in the frozen section. In addition, a marginal sample was taken at the base of the wound, as the resection there was probably very close in sano, to ensure that R0 was also present at this site. This was also confirmed by the pathologist. Ultimately, after frozen section, R0 resection. Transition to neck dissection.

CT shows that the malignancy appears to be growing into the left-sided base of the tongue and laterally towards the pharyngeal wall. Sonographically, there is a cN2b cervical lymph node status.","Tracheoscopy by the surgeon is extremely difficult in the case of a severely overhanging epiglottis, but can be performed on its own and shows unremarkable findings. Then intubation by the anesthesia colleagues and start with the flexible esophagoscopy: Advance into the stomach under continuous air insufflation. Now, after diaphanoscopy, insertion of the PEG tube in the usual manner without complications. No evidence of tumor or stenosis of the esophagus on retraction. Now insertion with the Kleinsasser D-tube in narrow conditions and inspection of the oropharynx. The previously described ulcerated mass of the left tonsil is seen, which spreads into the left base of the tongue in the area of the glossotonsillar groove. Palpatory findings are coarse here. The exophytic growth ends clearly in front of the uvula. Otherwise free hypopharynx and endolarynx, as far as visible also free. Esophageal entrance free. Now insert the tonsil plug and mark the resection margins. The tumor is first removed with the electric needle in the area of the palatal arch while preserving the uvula. To do this, the posterior palatal arch is cut through to the posterior pharyngeal wall. The tumor is now gradually cut around, partly electrically and partly cold, in the direction of the lateral pharyngeal wall. Now the tumor is cut around anteriorly in the base of the tongue and up to the middle of the tongue base so that the tumor becomes more mobile. The tumor can be easily removed both cranially and in the area of the base of the tongue; laterally, resection is more difficult. It is resected to such an extent that the submandibular gland is exposed and a larger vessel can be seen. In between, repeated bipolar coagulation and then removal of the tumor en bloc. The tumor is suture-marked as follows: Long/long suture corresponds to the lateral deep resection margin; ...... short/short to the base of the tongue at the caudal margin; short/long to the cranial margin in the area of the palatal arch. Extensive hemostasis is now performed and samples are taken from the margins as follows: Once from the lateral resection margin in the area of the submandibular gland, then in the area of the deep lateral base of the tongue and in the area of the left palatal arch. These samples are taken for final histological evaluation. Once again, extensive hemostasis is performed and a TachoSil sponge is placed on the vessel and the exposed gland. Unblocking and checking again after several minutes shows no renewed bleeding. Now transfer to tracheotomy: instillation of 4 ml xylocaine with adrenaline. Modified Kocher collar incision and visualization of the subcutaneous tissue, transection of the same and preparation of the trachea. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus and its removal after repositioning. Insertion into the trachea and, after placement of a Björk flap, placement of a plastic tracheostoma in the usual manner. Conclusion: Tumor was resected enorally as far as possible. If tumor remains laterally and this is proven in the histological tissue samples, further tumor resection from the outside with flap coverage is unavoidable. Otherwise, neck dissection should be planned on both sides in 14 days.","Enoral tumor resection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement, Panendoscopy

Therefore above mentioned surgery indicated.,"First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The exophytic tumor that was described can be seen starting laterally from the arytenoid fold and passing over the anterior piriform sinus wall onto the lateral piriform sinus wall. In addition, there is a flat, tumor-suspicious elevation, which has not been described before and is also tumor-suspicious. The decision was therefore made to cut around the entire area with a safety margin of at least 4-5 mm on all sides. Adjustment of the tumor with the spreading laryngoscope. Incision of the tumor with a distance of at least 0.5 to 1 cm on all sides. Resection extends laterally to the lateral wall up to the border of the posterior wall. It extends to the arytenoid fold, whereby the upper part is also resected, leaving the arytenoid cartilage free of mucosa. Resection extends over the most lateral part of the postcricoid region up to the vicinity of the tip of the piriform sinus. Cranially, parts of the vallecula and the base of the tongue are removed. Laterally, the pharyngeal wall is resected, but if the tumor is relatively flat, the musculature can be partially preserved. No fat prolapse at any point. The tumor is now marked with sutures. In the frozen section, in addition to the invasive carcinoma described, there is a second in situ carcinoma with a lateral margin. Thus indication for lateral resection. Once again, the tumor was positioned and an approx. 1 cm wide strip of mucosa was resected from the edge to the posterior wall via the lateral side wall to the vallecula area. Then take a marginal sample from the region described. This goes to the frozen section in 2 parts, lateral cranial belonging to the base of the tongue and lateral caudal belonging to the area of the posterior wall of the hypopharynx. No tumor infiltrates here. Thus now R0 situation. Now careful hemostasis. At one point, the musculature of the pharyngeal wall is slightly more severely damaged, but an outer part of the pharyngeal musculature remains in the direction of the large vessels. A tachosil fleece is placed here to secure it. No evidence of bleeding on final inspection. Due to the overall situation of the relatively large wound area with potential risk of bleeding and with regard to the removal of a protracted swallowing disorder, tracheostomy is now indicated. Repositioning of the patient. Injection of a total of 5 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline. Sterile draping. Small Kocher collar incision. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue into the infrahyoid musculature, which is split in the middle. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped off, severed and supplied with puncture ligatures. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Entering the 2nd intercartilaginous space. Creation of a wide pedicled Björk flap. This is epithelized in the typical manner. Finally, insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. At the end of the operation, the site is checked again and there is no evidence of bleeding. The procedure is completed without complications. The patient should be fed via the PEG tube for at least one week, then carefully build up the diet and initiate swallowing training if necessary. Discuss further procedure in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Laser resection, Tracheostomy creation

The external and internal carotid arteries are now completely exposed. Resection of the posterior digastric muscle, release of the submandibular gland with resection of level Ib and protection of the marginal mandibular ramus. The pharyngotomy is now performed via the tonsil lobe and additionally via the submandibular and connection of the pharyngeal openings and successive exposure of the tumor. Resection of the tumor in toto, also maintaining an adequate safety margin. The entire caudal tumor is now also imaged with marginal specimens. In addition, a generous resection is performed in the area of the soft palate, as is the renewed removal of margin samples. All marginal samples were found to be free of carcinoma and without evidence of higher-grade dysplasia, meaning that the overall situation is now R0. The defect was then measured and the decision was made to reconstruct the defect with the antero-lateral thigh graft due to the size of the defect, extensive pharyngeal resection extending into the vallecula and piriform sinus entrance. The neck dissection of the left side is performed first. To do this, make a skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Old auricularis magnus nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, facial vein, hypoglossal nerve and cervical vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve, clearing of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches without evidence of caudal lymph leakage. The wound is then carefully inspected. Wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. The tracheotomy is then performed due to the extensive defect. Horizontal skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Entering the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Subsequent problem-free transfer to a 9 mm low cuff cannula. The antero-lateral transfemoral graft is then removed. After marking the landmarks and doppler sonographic identification of the main perforator and 2 strong secondary perforators, the graft measuring up to 12 x 7 cm in total is marked with a special soft palate configuration. First medial incision, cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the fascia lata. Identification of the rectus femoris muscle. Strict subfascial dissection and identification of the S-stem. The anatomy is largely regular with a perforator branching off the ramus descendens and a circumscribed intramuscular perforator course. The relief incision is now made. Dissection of the vascular pedicle, complete resection of the graft. Removal of the fascial ata. Dissection and removal of the peripheral vascular pedicle. Subsequent elevation of the graft, leaving a small muscle cuff in the area of the outgoing perforator. Subsequent isolation onto the vascular pedicle. Exposure and entrainment of a slightly weaker accompanying vein and placement of the graft with regular blood flow after ligation. Then, if the wound is dry, adjust the wound edges and carefully close the wound in two layers after inserting a 10-gauge Redon drain. Subsequent application of the graft. This is done transorally and transcervically. Finally, good fit and intact conditions on all sides. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein. Performing the arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. This was successful and sufficient. Immediate regular venous return. Subsequent conditioning of the facial vein. Measuring a coupler size 4.0 and performing the venous anastomosis with the coupler system. Followed by regular .......pulsation. Positive spreading phenomenon. Excellent graft perfusion so that the stalk is then positioned. Then, with dry wound conditions, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Final inspection and completion of the procedure with a vital graft. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics for 24 hours. Conclusion: Intraoperatively R0 resected discontinuously growing right oropharyngeal carcinoma resembling cT3 cN2b. Defect reconstruction using ALT on the right. If the graft has healed properly and is intact, a diet can be started from the 8th postoperative day. Continuation of intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g for 24 hours. After receiving the definitive histology, presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference to plan the adjuvant therapy that will certainly be required.","Resection, Neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (ALT), Tracheostomy, PEG placement

No crossing of the midline. Caudally, the process extends to the entrance of the piriform sinus. This confirms the indication for surgery. Initial positioning of the head, insertion of tonsil retractor and retractor alternately. Start resection from the transoral side: cut around the process with a safety margin of 1.5 to 2 cm on all sides. Take the soft palate including the uvula with you. Resection extends beyond the lower jaw, mucosa is pushed away from the lower jaw. Pharyngeal muscles and thyroid muscles are resected in a lateral cranial direction. Resection extends to just in front of the tube. About 60 % of the base of the tongue is resected. Marginal samples are taken from the palatal arch to the beginning of the alveolar ridge, from the alveolar ridge to the floor of the mouth, from the floor of the mouth to the tongue and from the base of the tongue, as well as marginal samples from the medial pharyngeal wall or posterior wall of the palatal arch in the cranial region. The caudal view is too poor, therefore the resection is continued after the neck dissection on the right, which is dictated separately. Resection of the digastric muscle with removal of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the internal and external carotid arteries, the internal jugular vein and the cranial nerves. The glossopharyngeal nerve is resected distally. The lingual nerve is also resected towards the floor of the mouth. The pharyngeal wall is detached from all vessels, as is the hypoglossal nerve, which is preserved. The tumor is resected cranially and pushed caudally under the lower jaw with resection of the masticatory muscles attached to the lower jaw. Caudal resection under vision, whereby the resection is carried out below the caudal tumor borders to a length of 2 to 3 cm. Margin samples are taken cranial basal, medial basal and caudal basal. A marginal sample is also taken from the caudal part of the medial pharyngeal wall with the piriform sinus extending to the aryepiglottic fold. All marginal samples are thread-marked for frozen section. In the frozen section, marginal specimen in the caudial medial pharyngeal area, piriform sinus area and arytenoid area with in situ infiltrates. Therefore, a generous resection of an approx. 1 cm wide strip from the area of the caudal pharyngeal wall of the piriform sinus and the areas of the medial arytenoid fold up to the border of the postcricoid region. Another marginal sample from this area. Despite the extensive laryngeal resection, the marginal specimen still shows almost continuous in situ infiltrates in the piriform sinus and in the arytenoid region extending to the postcricoid region. Thus, given the distance from the main tumor, there is a suspicion of extensive growth in the direction of the piriform sinus and postcricoidal region. Due to the expected dysphagia with further resection in the direction of the postcricoid region in view of the flat growth, no further resection is performed. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: In preparation for transcervical tumor resection, the neck is first dissected on the left side. To do this, make a curved skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation while preserving the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve and the facial vein; a small, superficial branch is removed. There are now several conspicuous nodules in levels II a and III. No evidence of perinodal growth or infiltration of the surrounding structures. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Exposure and preservation of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Finally, no evidence of lymphatic leakage. Later, the external and internal carotid arteries are skeletonized to differentiate them from the enoral defect. Here, the lingual artery is exposed over a long distance. Subcapsular release of the submandibular gland is then performed. It can be seen that the cranial glandular cone is directly adjacent to the tumor. Therefore, this resection is performed together with the tumor resection. Removal of level I b. Several nodules up to 1.5 cm in size. The neck is now dissected on the right side. The procedure is basically the same. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Clearing out the anterior neck preparation while preserving the facial vein, superior thyroid artery and hypoglossal nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and completion of level V with careful preservation of the cervical plexus branches. In addition, the strong external jugular veins were spared on both sides. Careful irrigation of the wound. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Plastic tracheotomy is then performed. This involves a horizontal skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Dissection of the musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring and creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap. Subsequent problem-free insertion of a size 8 suture-fixed low-cuff cannula. At the same time, the radialis graft was lifted from the left forearm. After measuring the defect, a graft configured for the floor of the mouth, tongue, tonsil lobe and pharyngeal side wall was lifted, measuring up to 15 x 11 cm in total. After marking and placement of the tourniquet, the graft is recut and an arc-shaped relief incision is made in the direction of the antecubital fossa. Radial exposure and entrainment of the cephalic vein. Expose and secure the superficial radial nerve ramus. An oblique branch towards the palm must be removed, otherwise the main branch must be preserved. Expose the distal vascular pedicle. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Release of the distal vascular pedicle after ligation of the vessels. Ulnar preparation. Exposure of the flexor carpi ulnaris. Strictly subfascial graft release and dissection of the pedicle proximally with treatment of outgoing vessels. This shows sufficient confluence between the superficial and deep venous system, but clearly altered veins after puncture, so that the deep vessel is also included. After removal of the graft and careful hemostasis, the wound is carefully closed in two layers and the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the right groin is fitted. Finally, a good fit. Application of a vacuum sealing bandage and the Kramer splint in the functional position and repositioning of the arm. For full-thickness skin harvesting from the groin on the right. For this purpose, a graft measuring 20 x 8.5 cm is cut around an extensive graft, strictly cutaneous elevation. Extensive mobilization towards the abdomen and thigh fascia. Subsequently insertion of a 10 Redon drain in dry wound conditions and careful, multi-layered wound closure under moderate tension conditions. The graft is then inserted. This is considerably more difficult due to the extensive wound surface and exposed mandibular bone. However, the overall fit is good. Fitting of the graft with complete coverage of the resection area. Guide out the vascular pedicle cervically. Conditioning of the facial vein and the already prepared lingual artery. Perform the arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. This is successful and sufficient. Immediate venous return exclusively via the deep venous system, therefore, after measuring a size 3.5 coupler, problem-free venous anastomosis with the facial vein. Subsequently, if the graft circulation is normal, a 10 Redon drain is placed after multiple wound inspections and the wound is carefully closed in two layers. Subsequently, if the graft is vital and the patient is stable, the procedure is terminated at this point without any indication of complications. Conclusion: At least cT3 cN2b G2 rCIS-resected oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left. Defect reconstruction using a radialis graft. Please continue antibiotics for 24 hours postoperatively. If the graft heals properly, food can be restored on the 9th to 10th postoperative day with good swallowing function. .","TU resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage with radial flap, Tracheostomy

Placement of the McIVOR blade. Inspection of the oral cavity. This revealed a slightly hardened tonsil on the left side. The decision was made to perform a direct tumor tonsillectomy, including the anterior and posterior palatal arch. As part of the resection, a large safety margin is clearly maintained from the tonsil. Dissection from caudal to cranial, including fibers of the constrictor pharyngis medius muscle. The tonsil preparation is sent for intraoperative frozen section examination, which results in the diagnosis of a squamous cell carcinoma, forming a margin in the caudal area of the resectate. Therefore, resection in this region. Removal of three marginal samples (posterior palatal arch, anterior palatal arch, wound base) which were found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleagues. Thus, an R0 resection in the area of the left tonsil can be assumed. Subsequently, an esophagoscopy was performed. Advancement of the endoscope into the stomach. Inconspicuous conditions there.

In the preliminary findings, the tumor had grown significantly faster, therefore an urgent surgery was indicated. CT showed relatively flat extension, no infiltration of the mandible.","Enoral tumor resection dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Positioning of the patient for pharyngoscopy and transoral resection. During oral cavity inspection and pharyngoscopy, the tumor is seen in the area of the anterior palatal arch transition to the wire palate, through smaller extensions growth over the glossoalveolar groove to the cheek. Tumor also occupies the anterior palatal arch and tonsil region, growing forward to the floor of the mouth and the base of the tongue. Growth also towards the lower jaw. In the premolar region, growth also extends to the alveolar region, with marked thickening and suspected tumor infiltration. Transoral resection is now performed: insertion of mouth blocks. Application of a tongue tie suture. Exposure of the tumor. Incision of the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm to all macroscopically visible tumor margins. The anterior palatal arch and tonsil, tissue of the anterior palatal arch transition to the hard palate, which is exposed in bone. To the side, pterygoid muscles and buccal mucosa are removed. To the depth in the cranial region, removal of the deeper parts of the pterygoid muscles, removal of soft cheek parts up to the lower jaw, removal of the periosteum from the lower jaw. For better assessment, one remaining molar, one premolar and the canine must be extracted. When the periosteum is pushed over the alveolar space, tumor infiltration into the alveoli can be seen. The resection extends forward to the floor of the mouth, the lingual nerve cannot be preserved and is resected together with glandular tissue and muscle tissue. A small part of the base of the tongue is also resected. The specimen is marked in multiples and sent for frozen section histology. In addition, a marginal sample is taken from the front of the cheek via the alveolar ridge to the floor of the mouth at the edge of the tongue for frozen sectioning, also marked with sutures. In the frozen section, all tumor margins on the specimen are clear, except in the area of the transition from the alveolar ridge to the floor of the mouth, where there are small focal CIS infiltrates. Also tumor infiltrates in the soft tissues, in the floor of the mouth below the mucosa. A broad resection of the mucosa is therefore performed from the cheek area over the alveolar ridge in front to the floor of the mouth and extending to the edge of the tongue. In addition, a marginal sample is taken from the same area, which is thread-marked and sent to the frozen section. Also resection of the soft tissue at the floor of the mouth, removal of parts of the submandibular gland, floor of the mouth muscles, removal of the wharton duct, resection extends to the sublingual gland. Prior to this, further removal of soft tissue as a marginal sample, consisting of glandular tissue, muscles and periosteum on the lower jaw. Both marginal samples are now tumor-free, so that the resection of the tumor is healthy with regard to the soft tissue situation. In this case, the soft tissue situation is the same as the R0 situation. As part of the marginal sampling, a marginal sample was also taken from the alveolus in the premolar region, where areas of suspected tumor were found. Here, the tumor infiltrated the bone through the alveoli. Thus, a complete infiltration of the bone into the medulla can be assumed. To complete the tumor resection, a mandibular resection is required here, with replacement by fibula or scapula graft. Completion of the resection at this point. PEG placement and tracheotomy are performed, which is dictated by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. After enoral tumor resection, meticulous hemostasis. Subsequent insertion of the flexible gastroesophagoscope and easy advancement under air insufflation into the stomach. A clearly reddened esophagus with whitish mucosal deposits is already visible about 25 cm from the dentate line, with only sections of inconspicuous mucosa up to the cardia area. The gastroesophageal junction shows about 5 cm cranially extending, bleeding lesions of the folded ridges, reflux-associated DD Barrett's esophagus, DD (Winson's syndrome). In this case, a gastroenterological check-up with sampling is absolutely necessary in the further course. Air insufflation in the stomach, clearly positive diaphanoscopy and placement of a PEG tube using the thread pull-through method without any problems. The patient was then repositioned, abjoded and draped. Marking the incision for the tracheostomy. Cutaneous incision, subcutaneous preparation, longitudinal division of the linea alba. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus at its upper and lower edge, undermining of the same. Clamping of the isthmus on both sides. Sharp transection and repositioning of both isthmus edges. Incision between 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Application of a Björk flap inferiorly on both sides, fixation of the tracheostoma using 4 holding sutures cranially and caudally, a tension-reducing cutaneous suture on both sides and an additional lateral cutaneous suture on the left. Subsequent problem-free reintubation and ventilation via the cannula. The procedure was completed without complications. Please contact the oral surgery colleagues immediately to complete the operation and cover the defect with a periosteal graft. This should cover parts of the floor of the mouth and the bony structures in the upper jaw. It is not absolutely necessary to cover the area of the palatal arch, as the posterior palatal arch is preserved here. Aim for early transfer of the patient to the maxillofacial surgery department. Please continue the antibiotic treatment that was started intraoperatively with Unacid.","Resection, Tracheotomy, and PEG placement

After exclusion of suspicious primary areas on PET-CT, CUP panendoscopy revealed a differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in a blind biopsy in the area of the left base of the tongue which could not be detected macroscopically despite multiple panendoscopies. Hence the indication for resection. In addition, the postoperative sonography and questionable PET-CT showed 3 suspicious changes supraclavicularly, therefore indication for neck revision.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, positioning of the patient. First, a pharyngo-laryngoscopy is performed again. With the Kleinsasser tube, the oral cavity is inconspicuous, the tonsillolarynx is inconspicuous, the hypopharynx and endolarynx are inconspicuous and there are slightly hyperplastic conditions in the area of the right tongue base as described above; on the left side, inspection reveals a lesion measuring just under 1 cm at the transition from the tongue base to the pharyngeal side wall, which is somewhat contact vulnerable. Under microscopic examination, impression of a superficial ulceration. Adjustment of the lesions with the Steiner tube. Subsequent resection of the lesion with the 5 Watt CO2 laser in superpulse mode. Free conditions in depth with regular and intact musculature. Macroscopic resection in sano of the barely visible lesion. Absolute blood dryness. The resectate is now sent for frozen section diagnostics with the question of the blind biopsied primary. The invasive carcinoma is found to be tumor-free at all edges in the frozen section and thus resected R0. However, due to the non-oriented specimen, definitive representative margin samples are then taken. Careful hemostasis with absolutely dry and slim mucosa. Completion of the procedure. In the meantime, the left neck revision was performed. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline at the caudal end of the scar with extension into the supraclavicular direction. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the internal jugular vein. Separate the sternal muscle insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle for better mobilization. The suspicious masses described above can now be clearly palpated. These are located partly between the clavicle and the omohyoid muscle, partly also in region V on the subclavian vein. Careful resection of the changes. The exact changes described sonographically with two masses measuring approx. 1 ˝ cm and a median 3rd mass can be extirpated. The two larger masses were also highly suspicious macroscopically. Careful palpation of the entire supraclavicular area, here no further masses. No evidence of lymphatic leakage. Careful hemostasis, wound irrigation with H202 and Ringer's solution and, in dry conditions, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT1 tongue base carcinoma on the left with residual cN2b lymph node status on the left. Overall, adjuvant radiochemotherapy is certainly indicated and necessary here.

Subsequently, endoscopic support laryngoscopy with unremarkable mucosal conditions in the area of the oral cavity. However, in the area of the right oropharynx, the tumor described above was found, starting from the lower tonsil pole on the right, subtotally occupying the lateral pharyngeal wall on the right up to the level immediately above the hyoid bone and with adjacent infiltration of the right base of the tongue. The piriform recess is without macroscopic tumor involvement on both sides. The final esophagogastroscopy also revealed no evidence of mucosal lesions or masses. A PEG tube is then inserted. For this purpose, diaphanoscopy and insertion of the PEG cannula under endoscopic view after detection of a cellular elevation of the gastric mucosa. The PEG tube is then inserted retrogradely using the Sellinger technique from the peroral side and fixed to the abdominal wall with appropriate traction. Sterile wound dressing. A tracheostoma is then created. For this purpose, a skin incision is made pretracheally below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and blunt dissection in the area of the linea alba of the prelaryngeal musculature. Locate the thyroid isthmus and cut through it. A tracheal flap is now placed caudally between the 2nd and 3rd cricoid cartilage and sutured to the lower edge of the stoma. The cranial skin edge is also fixed to the trachea and the lateral skin to each other. Re-intubation. Neck dissection is performed first on the right side. To do this, make a skin incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle, extending caudally and laterally, to improve postoperative lymphatic drainage. Then expose the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle after creating a cranial platysmal flap. Dissection down to the vascular nerve sheath. Then dissection along the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid bone. Now expose the lower edge of the submandibular gland and complete the neck block II/III cranially along the posterior digastric venter muscle. This shows an extensive, approx. 4 cm large metastasis in the area of region II, which is directly adjacent to the accessorius nerve, the internal jugular vein and the hypoglossal nerve, but does not infiltrate these structures. This allows the metastasis, whose capsule appears macroscopically intact, to be carefully dissected free of the structures. Dissection is considerably more difficult due to the growth of the metastasis in the direction of the jugular foramen. Further dissection of the vascular nerve sheath and completion of regions II, III and IV. This is followed by dissection of region V. Dissection down to the trapezius muscle in the cranial region Va while sparing the accessorius nerve. Dissection cranially down to the muscle, and in the caudal region the cervical plexus forms the deep boundary. After complete evacuation of region V (individual smaller lymph nodes can still be detected macroscopically here), the lateral pharyngotomy is performed immediately below the right hyoid bone in accordance with the previous endoscopy. After opening the pharynx, the spherical tumor, which is pedicled approx. 1 1/2 cm above the entrance, shows infiltrative growth in the area of the lower tonsil lobe on the right and the soft tissues of the neck there as well as in the base of the tongue. The tumor is now carefully dissected accordingly. A safety margin of at least 1 cm is maintained macroscopically. Complete the cranial resection from the enoral side using a tongue retractor and detach the tonsil in the right upper pole area caudally up to the transition to the base of the tongue. Final completion of the tumor resection via the lateral pharyngotomy approach. This procedure ensures the best possible view for the tumor resection. The resulting mucosal defect in the area of the lateral wall of the oropharynx and the base of the tongue on the right side is such that primary wound closure appears feasible and sensible. The pharyngeal wall is sutured on the right side, which is done in several layers by suturing the mucosa and the underlying pharyngeal and throat muscles. The wound surface of the base of the tongue and the tonsil lobe remain free. To prevent bleeding due to the deep wound surface, particularly in the area of the base of the tongue, the lingual artery is then ligated at its exit from the external carotid artery. Before the wound was closed, frozen sections were sent in in the area of the edges of the lingual artery and classified by telephone as tumor-free. While waiting for the frozen section result, the neck dissection was performed on the left side. Here, the skin incision is also made in the area of the sternocleidomastoid anterior edge, also extending latero-caudally and dissection of the sternocleidomastoid anterior edge down to the vascular nerve sheath. Now dissect along the omohyoid muscle to the hyoid bone and along the posterior digastric venter muscle to the base of the skull. In the region of regions II, III and IV, there are isolated slightly enlarged lymph nodes, which, however, do not appear suspicious macroscopically. Finally, clear out region V while protecting the accessorius nerve. Dissection down to the trapezius muscle and in the lower section to the cervical plexus. After careful hemostasis, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Platysma suture, subcutaneous sutures and single-button skin suture. Same procedure on the right side. A light pressure bandage is applied for the first 2 days to protect the pharyngeal suture.  ","Partial resection of the pharynx [Partial pharyngeal resection]

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment was recommended. Sonographically somewhat unclear neck status. CT staging showed cM0.","After positioning the patient, initial inspection of the primary tumor region. There is a superficial ulcerated tumor in the area of the right tonsillar lobe with transition over the glossotonsillar groove into the base of the tongue. On palpation, however, there is also clear submucosal tumor growth with at least 1 cm deep infiltration. In addition, tumor extension into the upper pole of the tonsil and here extending to the palatal arches. The tumor is now resected transorally with a safety margin of a good 1 cm. Inclusion of the anterior palatal arch. Resection of the tumor in the area of the tonsil in the sense of a tumor tonsillectomy. Some scarring in the area of the posterior palatal arch. Good lateral control. Submucosal tumor extension caudally, therefore widening and resection of the pharyngeal side wall into the hypopharyngeal region up to approx. 1 cm below the level of the epiglottis. Resection of the glossotonsillar groove and circumscribed resection of the base of the tongue on the right. The specimen is now thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. This shows tumor extensions up to the posterior palatal arch with otherwise in sano resection. Basally, there is also an in sano resection, but with a safety margin of 2 to 3 mm in the narrowest area. This has already been identified macroscopically and marked with sutures. Therefore, the final margin sample is now taken in the area of the basal wound bed, primarily to extend the safety margin in the case of a histologically in sano resection. This is followed by a generous resection in the area of the entire posterior palatal arch and a new covering margin sampling. This is later diagnosed as tumor- and dysplasia-free in frozen section diagnostics. Due to the now extensive wound area, a protective tracheotomy is later performed. First repositioning for neck dissection of the right side. Incision along a skin fold. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure and dissection of the external jugular vein with transverse course. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical artery, the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. The extremely slender facial vein is removed. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Cranial dissection and removal of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and completion of the neck dissection after exposure of the common carotid artery and vagus nerve while sparing all the structures mentioned. Macroscopically no necessarily suspicious nodes. Finally, wound inspection and wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. The tracheostomy is then performed. Skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and sparing dissection of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedunculated Björk flap. Incision of the tracheostoma. Subsequent problem-free transfer to a size 8 low-cuff cannula, followed by final enoral wound inspection and, if the wound was dry, completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected, at least cT2 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Leave the cannula in place until postoperative day 5, after which direct decannulation can be performed if necessary if the wound is healing properly.

Then tracheoscopy: No abnormalities in the trachea area. The mucous membranes here are smooth and unremarkable. The patient is then intubated by the anesthetist. Esophagoscopy: The flexible instrument enters the esophagus without any problems. Then visualized up to the stomach. A clearly reddened erosive mucosa in the form of erosive gastritis can be seen. The stomach is otherwise empty. The mucous membranes show no evidence of a tumor or other mass. After releasing the insufflated air, the esophageal mucosa is then reflected back and carefully inspected. No evidence of a mass or other changes to the mucosa. Hypopharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: No mucosal abnormalities in the hypopharynx and larynx. The vallecula is free, the base of the tongue is free, there is a regular laryngeal skeleton. The piriform sinus can be freely unfolded on both sides. The postcricoid region and the esophageal entrance plane also appear normal. Then insertion of the oropharyngeal retractor and inspection of the oropharynx. In the area of the tonsillar lobe on the left side, an exophytic change in the mucosa can already be seen beginning at the anterior palatal arch, which extends into the glossotonsillar groove and to the base of the tongue. It also appears to infiltrate the edge of the tongue in the posterior third. The mucosa below the lower tonsil pole is free and inconspicuous. The other mucous membranes in the oropharyngeal region appear free and inconspicuous. The mass does not appear to infiltrate the base of the tongue. Tumor resection then begins on the anterior palatal arch. The resection margins are initially marked with the monopolar coagulation needle with a sufficient safety margin. The tumor is then successively removed from the tonsil larynx with subtotal removal of the anterior palatal arch under careful hemostasis. The lower pole of the tonsil appears relatively inconspicuous. Nevertheless, a sufficient safety margin is also maintained here in the area of the transition to the tongue base tonsil. At the transition to the glossotonsillar groove, the tumor can be seen infiltrating into the edge of the tongue as described above. Therefore, in order to have a better overview here, removal of the mouth retractor and insertion of a reinforced sharp hook to open the mouth. Then suture the tongue and pull out the tongue. The glossotonsillar groove and the edge of the tongue can thus be exposed very well. Here too, the tumor is then cut around with a sufficient safety margin and removed. The defect in the tongue is closed with inverting sutures. This is preceded by careful hemostasis. The tumor specimen is then thread-marked in toto for final histological assessment. In the resection area of the anterior tongue margin and in the area of the retromolar glossotonsillar groove as well as on the posterior and anterior palatal arch, several marginal samples are taken for frozen section and sent in. Here the intraoperative frozen section announcement is: all marginal samples are tumor-free. The patient then has a nasal feeding tube inserted via the right nostril. Due to the defect in the area of the tonsil tube and at the edge of the tongue, the patient should be fed via this tube for a week. The patient was then repositioned for neck dissection on the left side. First injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline in the area of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then ablation of the skin. Subsequent skin incision in the area of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth in layers and exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. The omohyoid muscle is exposed in the caudal section, the digaster venter posterior muscle is exposed in the cranial section. Then locate the accessorius nerve. Then detach the lateral neck preparation. It becomes apparent that in the area of the vein angle a highly visible mass must be sharply dissected from the vein wall. However, this is achieved with difficulty, so that the internal jugular vein can be well preserved. After clearing out the accessory triangle, the complete lateral neck preparation is fully developed and removed. The hypoglossal triangle is then removed. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and the branches of the internal carotid artery. All structures are spared. Then develop the anterior neck preparation. In the case of extensive goiter, the superior thyroid artery must be removed here despite extreme caution. The most careful hemostasis is then performed. The specimen is then sent for final histological examination with the tumor. After rinsing the wound and checking the bleeding again, a Redon drain is inserted and the wound is closed in several layers. The procedure is then completed without complications.","Transoral tumor resection, Left neck dissection, Panendoscopy

Therefore, again before planned removal of the change on the edge of the tongue on the right and the floor of the mouth on the right, panendoscopy and sample biopsies, in particular from the edge of the tongue on the right, to definitively confirm the diagnosis or exclude an invasive carcinoma.","First, anesthesia induction by the anesthesia colleagues. Followed by tracheoscopy. This reveals inconspicuous mucosal findings in the entire tracheal and laryngeal area. Now orotracheal intubation by the surgeon. Subsequent orohypopharyngoscopy and esophagoscopy as well as nasopharyngoscopy. A slight mucosal flap is seen at the base of the tongue. To be on the safe side, a marginal sample was taken, which was sent for final examination. No suspicion of malignancy here. Subsequent examination of the enoral area. Here, the flat change suspected of being malignant can be seen from the tip of the tongue on the right to the transition to the base of the tongue, passing over to the floor of the mouth, not exceeding the caruncle towards the middle. In addition, a leukoplakia-like change on the left tongue surface at the back of the tongue. A deep sample biopsy was taken in the area of the exophytic tumor. A marginal sample was also taken from the dorsum of the left tongue. Both are sent for frozen section. In the frozen section, change on the dorsum of the tongue, without evidence of malignancy. Carcinoma in situ with transition to invasive carcinoma at the edge of the tongue. Indication for partial resection of the tongue. The tongue carcinoma is incised macroscopically just under 1 cm in healthy tissue. Resection is carried out basally over a width of up to 1 cm. Resection includes the right half of the tongue and the floor of the mouth. Wharton's duct is partially resected in the distal area. The tumor is removed and marked with sutures, especially basally. Then circular frozen sections are taken, four in total. These are also thread-marked and sent to the frozen section. In the frozen section, both the tumor in the basal direction and the mucosal borders are not infiltrated by tumor after examination of the marginal samples. Thus R0 resection. Careful hemostasis is performed. Part of the lingual artery was bypassed in the tongue body area. The wharton's duct was incised at the junction of the distal middle meatus and sutured laterally to the remaining alveolar ridge mucosa. Subsequent careful hemostasis and irrigation. The procedure was completed without complications. As the resection had not spread to the base of the tongue and deeper oropharyngeal areas and was relatively superficial, a tracheotomy was not performed.

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the indication for emergency surgery was made.","After intubation and preparation by the anesthesia colleagues, the primary tumor region is inspected first. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube under dental protection. The oral cavity and oropharynx are inconspicuous, but with extensive post-radiogenic mucosal changes and significantly more difficult accessibility. In the area of the pharyngeal side wall already beginning on the oropharyngeal cavity, the ulcer described above is now visible, but the extension extends over the pharyngoepiglottic fold, also on the lateral free surface of the epiglottis and circumscribed on the right side on the vallecula. The base of the tongue itself is free, hardly any laryngeal adjustment is possible, but there is no extensive laryngeal infiltration. An attempt is now made to perform flexible esophagogastroscopy for PEG placement. Despite several attempts, this was not successful due to significant stenosis of the postcricoid region. However, there is no tumor here on inspection, so that PEG placement at this point must be dispensed with in the case of postradiogenic esophageal stenosis. A nasogastric feeding tube is now inserted, which is later surgically inserted into the oesophagus. The patient is then repositioned and prepared. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. Cervical incision in the area of the old scar and curved anteriorly onto the larynx. Skin incision. Cut through the scars, the scars must be sharply detached. Pronounced post-therapeutic adhesions here. Detachment of the skin mantle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and successive retraction of the muscle. Laborious dissection of the cervical vascular sheath. Preservation of the internal jugular vein, common carotid artery and hypoglossal nerve. Successful dissection of the cervical vascular sheath from the pharyngeal tube. No signs of infiltration here. The pharyngeal tube is now released. The tumor tissue is already palpable in the area of the piriform sinus. After release of the pharynx on the prevertebral fascia, the hyoid is released. Half of the hyoid is entrained. Entering enorally in the area of the base of the tongue, here in sano conditions, but position above the vallecula portion of the tumor. In sano resection, a good half resection of the epiglottis, release of the laryngeal skeleton. Resection of the piriform sinus is not possible on the right side, here directly near the tumor. Therefore, resection is performed on approx. half of the lateral thyroid cartilage surface, but here a good overview is obtained. The tumor infiltrates the laryngeal skeleton via the anterior wall of the piriform sinus, the medial wall is again exposed. At this point, discussion of the findings with <CLINICIAN_NAME> regarding the selvage situation and oncological and functional indication for laryngectomy. Due to the extent described above and the corresponding patient information without an explicit laryngectomy discussion, the decision is now made to attempt to preserve the larynx. After complete release of all margins, the tumor is now resected with an adequate safety margin. Resection up to the posterior wall of the hypopharynx and up to the esophageal entrance. Macroscopically in the mucosal area in toto. The basally pre-described lateral site was covered by preparatory separation from the cervical vascular sheath, here further marginal sampling is not possible, however, removal of all lateral neck soft tissue and scar tissue by neck dissection. Complete coverage of the tumor in the mucosal area and explicit coverage of the remaining paralaryngeal soft tissue, here complete coverage of basal margin samples, as well as removal of margin samples in the area of the exposed thyroid cartilage. All marginal samples are diagnosed as carcinoma-free without high-grade dysplasia in the frozen section diagnostics, so that an R0 situation now exists and the preservation of the larynx can be confirmed. There is still an extensive defect. Due to the pronounced postradiogenic conditions and the already highly variable vascular situation during neck dissection, the indication for defect coverage using a pedicled pectoralis major flap from the right is given. Submammillary position of the flap. Measurement of an area of skin measuring 14 x 8 cm. Elevation of a passive deltopectoral flap up to the second agiosome. Strictly subfascial dissection and elevation of the deltopectoral flap. Incision of the pectoralis major flap. Fixation sutures to the muscle, strictly subfascial release. Exposure of the pectoralis minor muscle, exposure of the pedicle vessel, inclusion of a muscle cuff and isolation on the vascular pedicle with an excellently vital flap. Successive insertion of the graft without torquing. Careful suturing in the area of the esophageal entrance around the inserted nasogastric tube while widening the esophageal entrance. Suture to the larynx. Overall tight conditions with an excellent vital flap until the end of the incision. Positioning of the stalk. Subsequent careful wound inspection. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain both cervically and twice pectorally with dry wound conditions. Adaptive cervical skin closure is then performed. Due to the course of the pedicle and the clear post-therapeutic scarring, complete wound closure is not possible despite mobilization of the neck skin, so the pedicle is left open over an area of approx. 6 x 6 cm and covered with Mepilex. Due to the slightly lowered conditions here, split skin coverage is not carried out at this stage. The granulation tendency should be awaited first. Adaptive cervical skin closure and strong wound closure in the breast area on all sides without increased tension. Subsequent completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected ycT3 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the right with circumscribed laryngeal infiltration. Due to the extent described above and the corresponding patient information, an intraoperative laryngectomy was deliberately avoided. However, due to the extensive resection, a significantly prolonged recovery or moderate prognosis with regard to swallowing function is to be expected. If there are no clinical signs of a pharyngeal fistula, an X-ray pre-swallow should be performed on the 10th to 12th postoperative day. Please continue intraoperative intravenous antibiotics for 24 hours.","Resection, Neck dissection

Therefore indication for the above-mentioned surgery.,"First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The exophytic tumor is seen in the area of the entire palatal arch with transition to the tonsillar lobe on the right and extending to the tonsillar lobe on the left. Initial PEG insertion: insertion of the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach. After creating the diaphanoscopy, a 9 mm abdominal wall tube is inserted in a typical manner without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall. Sterile dressing. Then transoral tumor resection: insertion of the Mc Ivor oral spatula. The carcinoma is removed en bloc with the electric needle with a safety distance of at least 1.5 cm on all sides. The tonsil and parts of the pharyngeal wall are resected, especially on the right side; on the left side, the upper part of the tonsil pole and pharyngeal wall area are also resected. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section diagnosis. Here the margins are tumor-free and therefore R0 situation. Subsequent radical neck dissection on the left and modified radical neck dissection on the right: start on the left side. Curved skin incision in front of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Lymph node tumor masses are visible which have infiltrated the sternocleidomastoid muscle, as well as the accessorius nerve. The internal jugular vein is also included. Dissection is performed from medial to lateral, hypoglossal nerve, common carotid artery as well as internal and external carotid artery are exposed and preserved, vagus nerve as well. Neck preparation is removed with resection of the accessorius nerve, sternocleidomastoid muscle and internal jugular vein. Branches of the cervical plexus are preserved as far as possible and appropriate. The internal jugular vein is double ligated cranially and caudally. This results in a radical neck dissection. Now neck dissection on the right side: here too, clearly positive lymph nodes, especially in the cranial region. The sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle are visualized. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein and common carotid artery as well as internal and external carotid artery. Subsequent visualization of the vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Development of the dorsal neck preparation while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Then develop the medial neck preparation, exposing and preserving the hypoglossal nerve, superior thyroid artery, facial vein and inferior thyroid vein. The external jugular vein was also preserved. The defect was then measured enorally. Now removal of the radial flap: marking of the radial flap in the required design, total length 11 cm and max. width 6 cm. Marking of the skin monitor. Cut around the skin monitor and radialis flap. Subcutaneous tissue is preserved over the subcutaneous tissue between the skin monitor and radialis flap. Curved skin incision up to the crook of the elbow. Radialis flap is now lifted from first ulna, then also radial subfascial. The radial artery is exposed and ligated. The lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve is exposed and preserved. Successive elevation of the radial artery flap below the vascular pedicle and subfascially in the direction of the elbow bend. Removal of subcutaneous tissue including the superficial and deep venous system in the upper area. Smaller and larger vessels are supplied with clips or bipolar coagulation or alloying. Exposure and confluence of the superficial deep venous system in the antecubital fossa, which finally flows together in a large antecubital vein. Exposure of the radial artery. Separation of radial artery and vein. Supply of the proximal vessels using clips or ligatures. Full-thickness skin is removed from the groin area in a size corresponding to the forearm defect. Here, after hemostasis, the wound is closed in layers and a Redon drain is inserted. The forearm is closed directly proximally and the full-thickness skin graft is successively inserted distally. A Vacuseal dressing with 125 mmHg suction is then applied. The defect of the palatal arch defect is now covered using the radial flap: First, a 2 - 3 finger wide tunnel is created through the pharyngeal wall to the right side of the neck. Then pass the flap from transcervical to enoral. Successive suturing of the flap first dorsally, then ventrally at the palatal arch. Complete closure of the defect from the transcervical side using sutures. This results in tension-free closure of the defect. The skin monitor is sutured to the neck skin. Vessels of the flap pedicle are dissected. The superior thyroid artery is removed and freed from the ...... The superior thyroid artery is anastomosed end-to-end with the radial artery using 8.0 ethylene sutures. Good arterial flow after opening the bulldog clamp. Venous return flow clearly recognizable, but intermittent due to arterial positions. Subsequent selection of the facial vein for the anastomosis. After dissection of the vessel wall, removal of the facial vein. Measuring. Selection of a 3.5 mm coupler. Anastomization of the vein of the flap pedicle with the facial vein using the 3.5 mm coupler. Good flow after opening the vessels. Upright test positive. Good enoral aspect.

The patient received postoperative radiochemotherapy up to 80 Gy. In 2004, the patient developed a pT1 pN0 uvular carcinoma, which was resected transorally and treated by neck dissection on the right side. Now the patient presents with a clinically and computed tomographically existing cT2 tongue margin/base of tongue carcinoma on the left side. Due to the ycN0 situation, it is decided not to perform a neck dissection revision. Thus indication for the above-mentioned operation.","After induction of anesthesia and transnasal intubation by the anesthetist, the oral cavity is first inspected and pharyngoscopy is performed: this reveals an exulcerated region of the posterior edge of the tongue just before the glossotonsillar groove with a clear hardening in the transition from the body of the tongue to the base of the tongue. Thus mouth opening with the ...ratchet and reining of the tongue. Set the resection margins at the glossotonsillar groove, about 1 cm towards the palatal arch, then on the lateral floor of the mouth anteriorly, about 3 cm behind the tip of the tongue and medially almost to the midline. The partial resection of the tongue is now performed successively with the electric needle under bipolar coagulation, taking care to maintain a safe distance from the tumor as far as possible. In the area of the maximum extension of the tumor, the resection reaches the midline of the tongue; further posterior, in the area of the base of the tongue, the resection goes back to the left side. In between, identify and ligate the lingual artery. The submandibular gland is only slightly .... The resection is now completed laterally in the area of the glossotonsillar groove, taking away approx. 1 cm of the lateral pharyngeal wall, whereby it should be noted that the palatal arch and in particular the glossotonsillar groove are clearly scarred due to the previous operations. The main preparation is now sent for frozen section diagnostics. In addition, a resection is performed of the area of scarring, transition from the glossotonsillar groove to the oropharyngeal side wall, as the tissue there appears suspicious. In the main preparation, the frozen section diagnosis identifies an R1 situation in the area of the base of the tongue, mainly at the mucosal level up to approx. 5 mm towards the tongue muscles. CIS is also diagnosed in the area of the glossotonsillar groove transition oropharyngeal side wall. Therefore, a resection is now performed in the area of the base of the tongue from medial to lateral up to the oropharyngeal side wall, which is approximately 1 ˝ cm wide and at least 5 mm thick. In addition, a generous resection is made in the area of the palatal arch transition oropharyngeal side wall, which also extends to the posterior oropharyngeal wall and is also sent for frozen section diagnostics. The tongue base preparation is found to be tumor-free, but a region with carcinoma in situ is also found in the caudal area of the posterior wall of the oropharyngeal side wall transition, now distant from the tumor. As a result, a 3rd resection of the oropharyngeal side wall is now performed, which also clearly extends towards the posterior pharyngeal wall and almost to the entrance of the piriform sinus. This resection is followed by a 3rd marginal sample, which is sent for frozen section diagnostics. This was also found to be a CIS in the frozen section, whereby the colleagues from the pathology department have now established that these CIS sites are not continuous, but are interrupted in different areas. Therefore, there is now a strong suspicion of field carcinomatization. Now consultation and demonstration of findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who advises no further frozen section diagnostics, but instead recommends a final, generous resection, which must then go to final histology. This is now done cranially in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall and goes caudally almost to the entrance of the piriform sinus and is sent to the final histology with a suture marker. In the meantime, after consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, a tracheotomy was indicated. For this reason, an approx. 2 cm long, horizontal incision was made directly caudal to the cricoid cartilage. Dissection through subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Identification and ligation of the anterior jugular vein. Identify the pretracheal muscles and spread the last one along the linea alba. Identify the thyroid isthmus and undermine the last one. Clamp off with 2 Pean clamps, cut through and reposition with 0 Serafit suture. Now expose the anterior tracheal wall, form a very sparse Björk flap between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring, this is secured with 2 tracheostoma threads caudally and 2 cranially and after readaptation of the skin, reintubation is performed on a 7-gauge Rügheimer cannula. A nasogastric feeding tube is also inserted. After re-inspection of the now very large wound area, which affects the anterior tongue almost to the midline, the lateral floor of the mouth and part of the base of the tongue up to approx. 1 cm in front of the vallecula and also extends over part of the palatal arch, the lateral wall of the oropharynx and the posterior pharyngeal wall almost to the midline. Intraoperative administration of 3 g Unacid, which should be continued, and administration of 250 mg SDH. Patient goes to the intensive care unit awake for monitoring.

Mirror examination and CT morphology as well as panendoscopy revealed a right oropharyngeal carcinoma. Therefore indication for the above mentioned procedure.,"Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Then the tracheotomy is first performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Tracheotomy: Marking of the landmarks and injection of lidocaine with suprarenin. Sterile ablation and draping. Skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Now strict dissection in the midline through the prelaryngeal muscles to the thyroid gland. This is coagulated below the cricoid cartilage and undermined using a clamp. Careful bipolar coagulation of the thyroid gland and separation of the latter. The anterior wall of the trachea is now exposed over a large area and with a good overview. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp. Suturing of the tracheostoma. A 9 mm blocked cannula is inserted without any problems. There was also no bleeding or complications during the tracheostomy. Repositioning and sterile washing and draping. Then insertion of a Mc Ivor oral catheter and start of tumor resection. The tumor is located on the posterior wall of the right oropharynx, crosses the midline and infiltrates the posterior and partially also the anterior palatal arch as well as the tonsil and ends in the vallecula on the right side. Beginning with tumor resection in the cranial part transorally. The tumor is lifted directly from the prevertebral fascia, although this is not infiltrated macroscopically. Involving the posterior and partially the anterior palatal arch. The tumor encompasses the tonsil and can be further dissected laterally. The tumor then reaches far into the cervical vascular sheath, so that fatty tissue and larger blood vessels are already visible transorally. Now the overview becomes very unclear, so the decision is made to dissect further transcervically. To do this, incise the skin in the usual way and first perform the neck dissection. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular and digastric gland, free dissection of the cervical vascular sheath. There are several nodes in level IIa and partly also IIb, these are lifted off the cervical vascular sheath in the conglomerate. This is possible without any problems. The accessorius nerve, hypoglossus, facial vein, superior facial artery and facial artery can all be preserved. Then enter enorally via the existing defect and dislodge the tumor. Then complete the tumor resection from the transcervical side. The tumor is placed on cork and sent to the pathology department for a frozen section. All margins are free of carcinoma and carcinoma in situ. The tumor specimen shows severe dysplasia only on the medial side of the margin to the left. The pathologist recommends taking another resection. This is done including a marginal sample. The margin sample is sent for final histology. Overall, the tumor can be resected on specimen R0. Then transition to neck dissection on the left side. Here again, the skin incision is made in the usual way. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland, digastric muscle, exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Sparing of the accessory nerve, hypoglossal nerve, cervical sinus, facial vein, superior thyroid and clearing of neck levels IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Insertion of a redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Elevation of the radial lobe graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME>: First marking of the 9 x 10 cm graft. Skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Locate the cephalic vein and dissect laterally from this to the musculature. Successive vascular dissection distally. Care is taken here to ensure that sufficient subcutaneous fatty tissue remains on the skin to avoid necrosis. Now carefully dissect the venous star. In the next step, both the flexor carpi radialis and the brachioradialis are dissected up to the ulnar flexion. Now carefully dissect along both muscles in depth. Small muscular vascular branches are glued or coagulated using bipolar coagulation. Locate the pedicle in depth and separate it from the surrounding area. Now further dissection distally. Skin incision of the ulnar flap edge and dissection of the fasciocutaneous flap up to the flexor carpi radialis tendon. The ulnar artery can be easily palpated and spared. Smaller venous outflows are coagulated. Now blunt exploration and dissection with the clamp to find the radial artery. This can be located, shows good pressure and is sutured using a lateral suture. Now further dissect the cephalic vein distally. This can be included in the flap. Lateral accesses are cut off. The superficial ramus of the radial nerve can be spared without any problems. The posterior cutaneous flap is now also dissected from the radial side using the scalpel on the underlying muscles. After further precise exploration of the venous star and exposure of the superficial and deep veins as well as the ulnar, radial and brachial arteries, the flap pedicle is now removed distally and proximally by means of a ligation. Suture the fascia to the subcutaneous tissue to prevent the flap from shearing off. Dissection of the pedicle vessels. Now perform the microanastomoses through <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the radial artery is anastomosed end-to-end with the superficial thyroid artery. The two veins are also supplied microanastomotically using a suture technique. Here the venous vessels are connected end-to-side into the internal jugular vein. After anastomosis, there is a good pulse as well as good filling of the vein after spreading. Suturing of the stalk in the desired position with Vicryl 3-0. Insertion of a Redon drainage and a Penrose drainage. Subcutaneous suture using Vicryl 3-0 and skin suture using Ethilon 4-0. Marking of the Doppler using a Vicryl thread. Final consultation with the anesthetist. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit without any major complications.","Combined transoral-transcervical tumor resection, Modified radical neck dissection on both sides, Tracheotomy, Free flap (Radial)

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment was indicated. Immediate preoperative sonographic cN2b neck status on the left, computed tomographic cT2 tonsillar carcinoma on the right. The simultaneous small oropharyngeal carcinoma could not be visualized by computed tomography.","After intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, a new pharyngoscopy is performed. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube under protection of the toothless chewing ridge. The oral cavity is unremarkable. On the right side, the exophytic change can be seen in the area of the right tonsil. This exceeds the caudal tonsillar pole and merges here with the caudal pharyngeal side wall, the overall extent is just cT2. The glossotonsillar groove is tumor-free. No transition to the base of the tongue. On mobilization, however, there is a spread to the posterior palatal arch at the mucosal level. No infiltration of the parauvular triangle. On the left side, the tonsil is somewhat bumpy and somewhat uneven on the surface. No extensive exophytic process at the site described above, only uneven mucosa. Therefore, in the case of palpable induration, first turn to tonsillectomy on the left side. This is done by removing the anterior palatal arch. Expose the tonsil capsule, this is certainly not exceeded. Detachment of the posterior palatal arch with sparing removal of some muscle. Separation at the lower pole with macroscopically inconspicuous conditions. The specimen is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. Turn to the right side. Cut around the carcinoma with a safety margin of 1 cm. Complete removal of the anterior palatal arch, the parauvular mucosa........ can be kept straight. Here too, the tonsil capsule is not exceeded, with some attached musculature on all sides. No exposed fatty tissue from the neck. Removal of some musculature from the posterior palatal arch and resection of the mucosal portion that exceeds the posterior palatal arch. Caudal separation in the area of the pharyngeal side wall with macroscopic in sano conditions. The frozen section diagnosis now shows a complete R0 situation for the right-sided carcinoma. On the left side, the margins are also free of carcinoma and dysplasia on all sides, but there is also no clear evidence of carcinoma intratonsillar. Therefore, if invasive carcinoma from the transition of the caudal part of the tonsil with transition to the base of the tongue is confirmed, complete resection of this area is carried out in the case of left-sided metastasis; this is done transorally under microscopic control as a laser resection with a 5 Watt CO2 laser. Adjustment of the area with the spreading tube. Resection of the left-sided tongue base edge of the pharyngo-epiglottic fold and the pharyngeal side wall. The resected area widely covers the previously described area. Completely covering and representative marginal samples are now taken, especially basally. Here, completely carcinoma- and dysplasia-free margin samples are found. In the central area of the post-resectate, Cis is found as a possible residual site of the biopsied tumor. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Due to the size of the resection, a protective tracheotomy is performed later. Otherwise, tissue transplantation can be dispensed with due to the localization of the defect. The left neck dissection is now performed. Selection of a submandibular approach. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle. Glandula submandiblaris including the caudal capsule and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve and the cervical artery; the slender facial vein is removed later. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. In the area of the jugulo-facial angle or level IIa, a livid, discolored and highly suspicious mass measuring approx. 3 cm can be seen, as well as smaller, also highly suspicious nodules in the surrounding area. Visualization and release of the accessorius nerve, which can be preserved. No reliable evidence of infiltration of the surrounding structures. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Subsequent evacuation of level Va with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Wound irrigation with H202 and Ringer's solution and after careful wound inspection under dry conditions, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Turn to the right side. Same procedure here in principle. Submandibular approach. After dissection of the platysma, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation and preservation of the superior thyroid artery and hypoglossal nerve. Level II shows several nodules up to 1.5 cm in size and macroscopically also appearing suspicious, also without infiltration of the surrounding structures. Exposure and free preparation of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful nerve protection. Subsequent evacuation of level Va with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Followed by careful irrigation of the wound with H202 and Ringer's solution. Inspection of the wound area and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Then perform a plastic tracheostomy as a protective tracheostomy. Narrow, horizontal skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and splitting of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal rings. Performing a visor tracheotomy and fitting with adapting sutures. Subsequent problem-free transfer to a size 8 low cuff cannula which is suture-fixed. PEG insertion was performed at the beginning of the procedure. This was done with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy to see through to the stomach. This was inconspicuous and clear. Now, with good pharyngoscopy, the stomach is punctured without any problems and the PEG tube is inserted using the usual thread pull-through method. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with clindamycin, which should be continued for 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT2 cN2b/c oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. In addition, R0 resected cTis/cT1 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left. Postoperatively, please abstain from food for approx. 4-5 days, after which the diet can be gradually built up. The tracheostomy is intended as a protective tracheostomy for 5-6 days. With regular enoral wound healing and adequate decongestion, direct decannulation can be performed. Presentation in our interdisciplinary tumor conference for adjuvant therapy that is certainly indicated.  ","Transoral laser resection, Bilateral neck dissection, PEG placement, Tracheotomy

Sonographic and computed tomography V.a. cN2c neck status without evidence of distant metastasis. On CT, extensive oropharyngeal tumor with extensive infiltration of the tongue with infiltration of the outer tongue muscles.","Detailed consultation with the anesthesia department. Positioning of the patient. Performing a pharyngoscopy. An extensive tumorous process of the right oropharynx is seen, growing predominantly submucosally, infiltrating approximately half of the soft palate, palpating hard to the transition of the soft palate. Tonsil lobe is tumorously depleted and massively widened. Transition to the posterior pharyngeal wall. The tumor is completely fixed in its surroundings, no mobility. The tumor extends dorsally close to the alveolar ridge, but does not appear to infiltrate it. On palpation, the base of the tongue is infiltrated to about one Ľ. The CT already shows continuous growth towards the cervix with direct transition to an extensive cervical metastasis, clinically with a coarse, moderately displaceable mass measuring approx. 8 x 6 cm cN3 neck status. First, transoral resection was performed to mobilize the tumour cranially. To do this, cut around the tumor in the soft palate while maintaining a safe distance of a good 1 cm. Subtotal entrainment of the soft palate up to the hard palate border. Adherence here but no infiltration. Therefore, detachment of the process from the hard palate with the Rasper with circumscribed exposure of the bone at this point. Cut around the soft palate buccally. Small tumor cone behind the alveolar ridge towards the buccal side, otherwise no infiltration here, but with pronounced fixation, highly suspected infiltration of the pterygoid musculature. Therefore, the tumor is cut around in the area of the soft palate and buccally. Release from the nasopharynx with resection close to the right tube. However, the tube is still spared. Exposure and mobilization of the pterygoid muscles. Significant infiltration here. Removal of the pterygoid muscles, exposure of the ascending mandibular branch. If there is clear adherence to the posterior mandibular ridge, incision here, paradental removal of the periosteum, thus clearly separating the tumor from the bone. Clearly no infiltration or periosteal perforation. The solution is later completed transcervically at the site of the posterior mandible. Transcervical resection is now performed in the case of an extensively fixed tumor that is growing continuously into the neck. Prior to this, covering samples are taken from the soft palate, the nasopharynx and the buccal margin. These are diagnosed as tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Now repositioning, initially for tracheostomy. For this purpose, a horizontal skin incision is made below the cricoid cartilage and the skin and subcutaneous tissue are cut through. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature, fissures along the linea alba. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Mobilization of the thyroid isthmus, transection of the slender isthmus after strong bipolar coagulation. With a relatively deep-seated larynx between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring, insertion of a broad-based pedicled Björ flap and incision of the tracheostoma with mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequent problem-free intubation onto a 9 mm low cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. Now repositioning first for radical neck dissection with subsequent completion of the tumor resection. To do this, make a skin incision over the extensive metastasis, curved at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the platysma. This is completely preserved and can be separated from the metastasis with a sliding layer. Therefore creation of a platysma flap anteriorly and above all dorsally. Complete exposure. The metastasis infiltrates and destroys the sternocleidomatoid muscle over a large area and appears to be located in the paravertebral musculature. Therefore, first caudal visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Showing the omohyoid muscle. Visualize the submandibular gland, visualize the digastric muscle. First visualization of the anterior venter. In the middle there is a clear adherence or infiltration of the digastric muscle, release of the anterior neck preparation with exposure and later removal of the cervical artery. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. Caudal exposure of the internal jugular vein. This is exposed caudally. Dissection of the vein, this is seen just cranial to the outlet of the facial vein, initially displaced, later clearly infiltrated. The facial vein is also infiltrated cranially. Therefore, both vessels are removed after double ligation. Caudal release, transection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection and release of level 5, showing clearly macroscopically enlarged, partly lividly discolored lymph nodes, therefore also removal of level 5b, mobilization of the omohyoid muscle, removal of the level up to the end of the clavicle. Careful protection of lymphatic structures, no exposure of the subclavian vein. Finally, after meticulous hemostasis, no evidence of lymphatic leakage. Cranial dissection of the extensive perinodal metastasis en bloc. Inclusion of the cervical plexus, parts of the paravertebral musculature, previous exposure of the common carotid artery, vagus nerve and phrenic nerve. Securing the nerves. Cranial release of the muscle hard on the mastoid. Free conditions here. The accessorius nerve is not exposed in the case of complete infiltration. Cranial infiltration of the caudal parotid pole circumscribed, therefore resection of the free caudal parotid pole, here close relationship to the oral branch, which however is only partially visualized, visualization of the digastricus venter posterior muscle, which is also free. In the area of the intermediate tendon or middle area, infiltration or direct contact with the tumor is clearly visible. Exposure of the internal jugular vein cranially. Deposition after double ligation. The metastasis can now be isolated to the carotid sheath, the digastric muscle as well as the area of the paralaryngeal muscles, here direct contact or tumor breakthrough with contact to the metastasis, therefore the metastasis is marked in this area. Cervically, the tumor infiltrates the entire lateral wall of the pharynx in the direction of the hyoid. Level 1b had already been cleared previously. At least one overlying lymph node can be seen macroscopically. Resection of the submandibular gland with partial exposure and protection of the branch of the mouth. The infiltrated digastric muscle shows a tissue turf, circumscribed to the connective tissue of the carotid artery, in the area of the bulb and the division site as well as circumscribed to the prelaryngeal musculature. Therefore, the carotid artery is now completely skeletonized far to the cranial side. No evidence of infiltration of the carotid artery. In case of hyoid infiltration, visualize and release the hyoid. Dissection median, with dissection rather adherence of the tumor than direct infiltration. Nevertheless, take along a good half of the hyoid after triggering. Carefully enter the vallcula, but the tumor can be felt immediately. Therefore widen the safety distance. Enter the pharynx. It can be seen that a tumor cone is directly approaching the petiolus, therefore a good 2/3 resection of the epiglottis. Removal of the hyoid bone as described above, removal of the pre-epiglottic fat, the tumor ends caudally just before the entrance to the piriform sinus. Cut around the tumor with a safety margin. The cone in the area of the epiglottis is seen before dissection as the cause of the circumscribed breakthrough in the area of the prelaryngeal musculature. Careful removal of the musculature, but in some cases complete basal resection through the neck resectate. Now successive exposure of the tumor. Removal of approx. 1/3 of the base of the tongue. Here there is a good 1 cm safety margin on palpation. Resection via the posterior floor of the mouth. In the case of adherence as described above, incision of the periosteum in the area of the dorsal mandibular branch, removal of the periosteum and completion for transoral removal of the tumor, in this case, as described above, no periosteal breakthrough and complete removal. Gradual release of the tumor after securing the carotid artery. A clear infiltration of the hypoglossal nerve was already evident beforehand. Separation of the hypoglossal nerve and, in the case of prolonged, clear macroscopic infiltration, removal of a marginal sample in the area of the hypoglossal nerve. This is shown to be tumor-free in the frozen section diagnosis. In the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, the tumor just reaches the midline. Here also resection with a safety margin, partial entrainment to the further safety margin of the prelateral vertebral musculature, but no injury to the prevertebral fascia. The tumor is now isolated cranially to remnants of the pterygoid musculature. Separation of the remains of the pterygoid musculature. Clear infiltration here. A resection of all muscle stumps is performed in the area of the pterygoid musculature, this is done to extend the safety distance to the definitive histology and covers the entire infiltrated pterygoid musculature. Here, however, also on the preparation macroscopically in sano. On the specimen, the tumor is now macroscopically and palpatorily resected in sano on all sides except for the previously described areas, which have broken through transcervically and are covered here by the neck dissectate or post-resectate. Macroscopically and palpatorily rather scarce areas are marked with sutures, the preparation is completely sent for frozen section diagnostics. Confirmation of the transcervical tumor extension, but mucosal area and also in the area of the pterygoid muscles as well as in the area of the base of the tongue and pharynx on specimen R0 situation. Therefore, hemostasis after careful wound inspection. Measurement of the defect. There is an extensive defect with an almost total soft palate defect extending to the hard palate, approx. 2/3 resection of the oropharynx, 1/3 resection of the base of the tongue, 2/3 resection of the epiglottis and complete resection of the vallecula. Measurement of a graft measuring up to 17 x 8.5 cm in total with corresponding configuration for the soft palate and the base of the tongue. Due to the extent of the graft, a decision is made to harvest an anterolateral thigh graft. Parallel to this, the neck dissection of the left side is performed. For this purpose, a skin incision is made on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation and careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve and the cervical sinus. Exposure and preservation of the facial vein. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Some macroscopically clearly conspicuous lymph nodes, therefore clinical confirmation of contralateral metastasis, but no perinodal growth here. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, evacuation of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Release of level 5 with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Careful wound inspection. Irrigation of the wound. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. For elevation of the anterolateral thigh graft after identification of the landmarks and the perforator line, doppler sonographic identification of the skin perforator approx. 4 cm cranial to the midline. Identification of a small secondary perforator in the area of the midline. Configuration of the graft under pedicle positioning. First enter medially. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the sartorius muscle. Exposure and reliable identification of the rectus femoris muscle. Strictly subfacial dissection, exposure of the vascular pedicle. The division of the lateral circumflex artery into 1 caliber-equal ramus descendens, ramus obliquus and transversus can be seen. The main perforator clearly originates from the oblique branch. The secondary perforator is most likely from the descending branch. Therefore, first visualize and dissect both branches. Dissection of the vessel now shows that both branches open separately into the lateral flexure of the circumflexus. Pronounced venous siphon. After reliable identification of the perforators, complete cutting of the graft and execution of the relief incision. Expose the fascia lata, cut through the fascia lata. With a very strong thigh overall and therefore a strong graft, it becomes apparent that the secondary perforator in the area of the future soft palate can only be utilized with the inclusion of muscle. Therefore, the secondary perforator is not used. The main perforator is purely fasciocutaneous. Installation on the main perforator after elevation of the fascia lata. With excellent flap vitality, placement of the descending ramus after ligation. Insulation on the ramus obliquus, vessel preparation. Dissection of a strong vein after dissection of the vascular findings. With excellent vitality, removal of the graft. Careful wound inspection. Wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, strong and multi-layered wound closure after insertion of two 10-gauge Redon drainage tubes. The graft is now inserted. Multiple sutures are placed transcervically and transorally. Insertion of the graft. Due to the thickness of the graft and the resection up to the hard palate in the area of the soft palate, the suturing conditions are significantly more difficult and the adaptation conditions are suboptimal. Subsequent sufficient soft palate closure. A small dehiscence must be left medial to the hard palate in the event of increased tension or lack of mucosa, but this should granulate without problems. Otherwise, successive insertion of the graft and overall more difficult conditions, but overall good fit. Regular and sufficient insertion with subsequently stable and dense conditions. Meticulous insertion in the area of the vallecula and the pharyngeal wall. In the case of dense conditions, the flap vascular pedicle is now conditioned. This shows a strong vein with a relatively slender artery, therefore dissection of the superior thyroid artery, distal placement. Furthermore, caliber advantages in the area of the superior thyroid artery. Therefore somewhat more difficult suturing conditions. Finally, however, good adaptation with 8.0 Ethilon with immediate regular venous return. Good pedicle pulsation. The first step is to condition the facial venous stump, but this is clearly thrombosed and with clear endothelial damage and a stump very close to the internal jugular vein, no further preparation is possible here, so the superior thyroid vein is conditioned. Regular flow conditions here. Measurement of a size 4.0 coupler. Problem-free insertion of the venous anastomosis, regular pulsation immediately after reopening the clamps and excellent enoral flap vitality. Careful handle positioning, wound inspection and, in dry wound conditions, insertion of two 10-gauge Redon drains in the case of a cervical paravertebral defect and subsequent careful two-layer wound closure. During wound closure, final multiple inspections and completion of the procedure with excellent flap vitality. Finally, detailed consultation with the anesthesia department and transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation. Note: The patient received intraoperative antibiotic prophylaxis with Unacid 3 g, please continue this for an initial 24 hours. Conclusion: Extensive intraoperative R0 resected cT4a cN3 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right with growth per continuitatem into the soft tissues of the neck, clinical metastasis on the right side up to level 5b. Due to the diffuse growth of the primary towards the soft tissues of the neck, an Rx situation should be discussed here. Adjuvant RCT urgently required. Please perform meticulous postoperative flap monitoring by enoral inspection. If the flap is still viable, an X-ray mucosa should be taken on the 10th postoperative day. Due to the extent of the tumor, significantly prolonged swallowing rehabilitation is to be expected.","Radical resection, Neck dissection, Free flap (ALT), Tracheotomy

Due to dental artifacts, it was not possible to determine the exact extent of the tumor in CT diagnostics. No evidence of metastasis on sonography and computed tomography. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was recommended and primary transoral resection was planned due to the initial extent of the tumor.","Initial inspection of the primary tumor region. An exophytic, exulcerated mass is seen in the area of the posterior third of the tongue, at the transition to the base of the tongue. This extends submucosally in a nodular fashion towards the posterior floor of the mouth and palpates and inspects via the glossotonsillar groove into the left tonsil and infiltrates it caudally. Submucosally also clear infiltration of the base of the tongue and infiltration of the tongue musculature. Overall clear cT2 extension. Transorally good resectability, but due to the extension in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth, the base of the tongue and the tonsil loge, indication for defect reconstruction. Demonstration of findings and case discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Confirmation of the extent and initial resection as planned. The tumor is therefore resected, taking the posterior free edge of the tongue on the left. Removal of the posterior floor of the mouth. A slightly extended tonsillectomy is performed. Here circumscribed exposure of neck fat tissue. Resection in the area of the base of the tongue, approx. one third, here also clearly extending into the musculature. Macroscopically safe resection distances. Targeted ligation of the lingual artery, which draws directly into the tumor and finally extirpation of the tumor macroscopically in toto, which is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics and is assessed here as resected in sano. Careful hemostasis. Insertion of a nasogastric feeding tube under laryngoscopic control. Due to the resection defect, there is now an indication for functional reconstruction of the defect. Therefore, initially only the neck dissection of the contralateral side and, due to the depth of resection, the protective tracheostomy are performed. Neck dissection of the right side is performed first. Skin incision along a horizontal cervical skin fold. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation and dissection of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and auricular nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland, taking the capsule with it. Exposure of the digasticus muscle and facial vein. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the facial vein, the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Cranial exposure of the accessorius nerve. Complete dorsal exposure of the internal jugular vein, exposing the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve up to the transition towards level V a, carefully sparing the cervical plexus branches. Overall, macroscopically no suspicious nodules. Careful wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Now create the protective tracheostomy. This involves a horizontal, circumscribed skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose the infrahyoid musculature and enter the linea alba. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Insertion between the second and third tracheal ring. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Incision of the cranial and caudal mucocutaneous anastomosis and subsequent problem-free intubation with a size 8 low-cuff cannula and completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT2 cN0 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right with clear infiltration of the base of the tongue. Due to the defect and the expected functional deficit with secondary wound healing, defect reconstruction using a microvascular graft (ALT or radialis) should be performed together with ipsilateral neck dissection. This should be planned promptly.  ","Transoral resection, Neck dissection, and Tracheotomy

No midline crossing on CT. Tumor extends over the glossoalveolar groove to the lateral pharyngeal wall on the left including the tonsil lobe. Therefore, the above mentioned surgery is indicated.","First laryngoscopy and pharyngoscopy: The tumor extension is as already described, no midline crossing but displacement of the rhaphe. Thus indication to perform the above therapy, no changes. First transoral tumor resection: insertion of the mouth retractors and ligation of the tongue. The tumor is now macroscopically incised on all sides with a safety margin of 1.5 to 2 cm. Approx. 60% of the base of the tongue is resected just above the rhaphe. The posterior half of the left tongue body is also resected. The floor of the mouth is also resected, including parts of the submandibular gland, whereby the lingual nerve is preserved. Resection extends over the glossoalveolar groove. Push off the bone here. The anterior palatal arch and tonsil are also resected, the posterior palatal arch is largely preserved. The resection extends caudally to the hypopharyngeal entrance. The entire specimen is removed and marked with a suture. Send for frozen section. In the frozen section, all margins are tumor-free, no evidence of higher-grade or invasive carcinoma infiltrates. Therefore R0 resection. The lingual and facial arteries had to be ligated during the resection. Overall indication for coverage with radial flap. Neck dissection on the left, split skin removal thigh on the right (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Transition to left neck dissection. Positioning of the patient. Take over the operation from <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Marking the skin along the suture with a pen. Skin incision, separation of the platysma, subtle hemostasis, exposure of the external jugular vein, which is preserved at the end of the neck dissection. Exposure of the auricularis magnus nerve, which is also preserved. Dissection on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the left under the fascia and further medially. Here on the cranial part, the accessorius nerve is exposed and preserved. Dissection and elevation of the skin flap. Further exposure of the most important anatomical structures of the neck such as the omohyoid muscle, hypoglossal nerve, hypoglossal nerve, free dissection of the VJI and its branches. Mobilization with dissecting scissors and forceps of the fatty tissue between the omohyoid muscle, VJI and anterior belly of the digastric muscle while protecting the vessels, which are later preserved for the anastomosis of the flap. Further dissection supported by magnifying glasses below the facial vein on the left side of the gl. submandibularis surface up to the edge of the mandible. Keep the facial muzzle branch out of the surgical area and hold it up by hacking the dissected tissue. Further careful dissection and mobilization of the salivary gland tissue at the posterior and anterior margins. The proximal part of the facial artery is encountered in front of the posterior digastric belly. This was dissected free, only branches to the submandibular artery were coagulated. The hypoglossal nerve became visible above the digastric sling. Coagulation of smaller veins. Anterior mobilization of the gland. The gland is now still partially attached to the excretory duct that was resected enorally during the tumor resection. After tightening the gland, the ganglion is removed, the lingual nerve is bluntly pushed aside, the remaining duct is exposed and removed together with the gland. This intentionally creates a defect in the floor of the mouth and later allows the blood vessels of the flap to be drawn in and the anastomosis to be made. Further removal of the level IIa and IIb lobes while sparing the accessorius nerve. Further detachment of the fatty tissue from the vascular-nerve sheath while sparing the ACI, ACC and vagus nerve. Further exposure of the branches of the brachial plexus up to the level of the junction of the omohyoid muscle with the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Removal of the neck preparation en block. After careful hemostasis, residual fatty tissue is included in the preparation. After the anastomosis, insertion of a Penrose drain to close the wound in layers. The PEG is now placed (<CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>): Insertion of the flexible endoscope under constant air insufflation, whereby the esophageal mucosa is free on all sides and without irritation. In the stomach, air insufflation and visualization of a positive diaphanoscopy. Now PEG placement according to the thread pull-through method in the typical manner. Without complications. Now repositioning for tracheostomy (<CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>): After infiltration of local anesthesia 10 ml Ultracaine 2% with Suprarenin added in the area of the planned skin incision between the cricoid cartilage and jugulum, also infiltration of the neck dissection side on the left. Then abjode and sterile draping of the adjacent areas. Marking of the landmarks and identification of the cricoid cartilage level and marking of the planned skin incision according to Kocher. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature and transection on the linea alba and exposure of the thyroid capsule. The pronounced anterior jugular vein was previously ligated. Then expose the cricoid cartilage and dissect under the thyroid gland using a clamp after exposing the lower pole of the thyroid gland. Then place Pean clamps and cut through the thyroid isthmus, followed by repositioning, first on the right and then on the left, in the typical manner. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea and opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cricoid cartilage. Then decision to perform a visual tracheotomy according to Deitmer. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma with 4 sutures and easy transfer to an 8 mm tube. Transfer for neck dissection on the right (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Infiltration with local anesthetic Ultracaine 2% with the addition of Suprarenin along the planned skin incision after marking the landmarks and marking the curved skin incision. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Cut through the platysma. The auricular nerve and external jugular vein had to be severed after they had been ligated. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Dissection and exposure of the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid. Then expose the posterior digastric venter muscle and the hypoglossal nerve and protect them. Now further dissection on the underside of the sternocleidomastoid and exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial and exposure of the same, whereby bleeding occurs in the middle section at an outlet. This is treated several times with Vascufil vascular suture, followed by hemostasis. Dissection cranially to the base of the skull. Start mobilization of the level IIa lymph node down to the scalene muscles and up to the mastoid. Successive detachment at the cranial end and detachment from the internal jugular vein, then mobilization at the edge of the sternocleidomastoid and finally pushing through under the accessorius nerve, with protection of the latter, further dissection is carried out caudally and with protection of the plexus branches, with removal of the entire lateral neck preparation down to the plexus level. The dissection is performed while sparing the vagus nerve after its exposure and sparing the internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery. Now remove the medial neck preparation. To do this, dissect the abdomen of the submandibular gland, remove the capsule and detach the specimen down to the level of the superior thyroid artery. The hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, plexus branches and accessorius nerve, internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein were spared. Subtle hemostasis using bipolar. No more evidence of bleeding. This results in a modified radical neck dissection level II to V a with preservation of the internal jugular vein, sternocleidomastoid muscle and accessor nerve. Insertion of a Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Subsequent removal of the radial flap: the defect is measured endaurally and the flap is marked on the left forearm in the appropriate, required extent and three-dimensional configuration, including the rejection of the pedicle. Flap length 11 and maximum 7 cm. First lift the flap from ulnar subfascial. Then extend the incision to the olecranon. Exposure of the superficial venous system with connection to the deep venous system Including the superficial venous system subfascially. Dissection of the flap also radially and subfascial elevation. Caudal exposure of the radial artery and the accompanying veins. Clamp off. Subsequent exposure of the radial artery pedicle with accompanying vein. Dissection up to the antecubital fossa. Exposure and connection to the superficial venous system. Two larger cephalic veins can be visualized as well as a radial artery with entry into the brachial artery in a typical manner. A very small radial vein can also be visualized as confluence. The radial artery is then removed when saturation is stable. This is treated with stitches. Successive elevation of the flap along the pedicle. Smaller vessels are treated with bipolar coagulation or clips. Lifting of the pedicle up to the elbow. Lifting including the superficial venous system. The entrance to the brachial artery is shown in the crook of the elbow. The interosseous artery is not severed. The two branches of the cephalic vein are then removed. Ligatures here. Subsequently, the radial artery is also removed and ligated proximally. Separation of the radial artery from the brachial artery. Here suture with 6-0 Vascufil. After removal of the flap, it is rinsed with heparin solution. The hand is always well perfused after removal of the flap. Hemostasis is performed on the hand. Primary closure of the wound in the elbow area up to the skin defect. Finally, a piece of split skin 0.7-0.8 mm thick is removed with the dermatome. This is worked into the defect. The cutaneous nerve to the lateral brachii, which was exposed and preserved during the elevation of the radialis flap, is also taken into account. Subsequent application of a Mepilex dressing with Octenilin hydrogel. Application of loose compresses. Wadding bandage. Fitting of a Cramer splint. Then wrap the hand in the Cramer splint using an elastic bandage. Hand always well supplied with blood. Saturation is almost always 100% at the end. Positioning of the arm. Now incision of the radial flap: First cut the digastric muscle and enlarge the tunnel enorally to a width of 3 QF. Then advance the caudal sutures. Insertion of the flap, first placing the caudal sutures and suturing the flap caudally. Then suture the flap in all other directions up to the cranial using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Tension-free, complete defect coverage in all dimensions is achieved, including the base of the tongue, floor of the mouth, glossoalveolar groove, pharyngeal side wall and tonsil lobe in the area of the anterior palatal arch. The stalk is or was passed through the throat. The left side shows the superior thyroid artery, the external jugular vein and the facial vein. All vessels are conditioned. The vessels of the flap pedicle are also conditioned. The radial artery is anastomosed with the superior thyroid artery using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow and good venous return. The external jugular vein is anastomosed with a branch of the cephalic vein. Coupler size 2.5 was used for this, the facial vein was anastomosed with the other outlet of the cephalic vein using coupler size 3. Good venous flow in each case after opening the clamp, smear phenomenon positive in each case. The remaining small radial vein is closed using clips. Subsequent very careful hemostasis. Irrigation of the entire wound area. The site is now free of bleeding. Closure in layers with insertion of a flap or Penrose drainage. The site suitable for Doppler sonography and flap control was marked using skin sutures. Finally, insertion or suturing of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. Another enoral flap check. This shows a well perfused flap. A hydrogel dressing was applied to the thigh. The procedure was completed without complications. Patient transferred to intensive care unit for monitoring. Please continue antibiotics, which were started intraoperatively, with Unacid for one week. Nutrition of the patient via the inserted PEG tube for at least 10 days, with gruel swallowing and, if necessary, diet build-up.

Due to the pronounced and penetrating depth, the above-mentioned operation including flap coverage was indicated.","Pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: confirmation of the extent of the tumor. Then repositioning for surgery: covering of all relevant surgical areas, injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into each side of the neck. Start with transoral tumor resection: insertion of Mc Ivor spatula. Exposure of the tumor. Cut around the tumor with a safety margin of approx. 2 cm along the mucosa. Resection includes anterior palatal arch up to the uvula. Posterior palatal arch can remain. A layer in the pharyngeal region can be dissected without showing tumor infiltration. Resection also includes the glossotonsillar groove along the alveolar ridge and parts of the base of the tongue and extends to the entrance of the hypopharynx. Tumor specimen is removed, thread-marked and sent for frozen section. Mucosal margins free in the frozen section, basal superior and inferior also free, basal medial near the large vessels forming a tumor margin. Therefore, definitive indication for resection of the entire pharyngeal wall and flap coverage. Neck dissection on the right and completion of the tumor resection from transcervical: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid anterior wall. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, the facial nerve with several outlets. Depiction of the internal carotid artery, external carotid artery and several branches. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Subsequent clearing of levels II to V while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Some enlarged lymph nodes cranially in levels II to III, macroscopically not clearly suspicious of malignancy. Then completion of the tumor resection from transcervical. The external and internal carotid arteries as well as the hypoglossal nerve and jugular vein are all marked using vessel loops and dissected from the pharyngeal wall. Subsequently, resection of the entire pharyngeal wall from the upper tonsil pole to the beginning of the base of the tongue under external and internal control. The pharynx was also suture-marked there. In the frozen section, there was no tumor here laterally towards the vessels. Thus final R0 resection. Neck dissection is then performed on the left: It is started from <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> and then completed. As on the opposite side, this is followed by visualization of all structures and level II-IV clearing. No significant enlarged lymph nodes here either. Subsequent tracheostoma placement: small Kocher collar incision here. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature, which is split. Subsequent exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped off, severed and supplied with puncture ligatures. The anterior surface of the trachea is then exposed. Creation of a broadly pedicled, modified Björk flap. This is then epithelialized in the typical manner to make it virtually tension-free. Then reintubation. Insertion of an 8 mm tracheostomy tube. Tracheotomy was performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Flap then removed from the left forearm: After measuring the size approx. 10 x 7 cm, mark the flap in the corresponding size dimension on the left forearm. Skin incision from the crook of the elbow curved to the flap borders, then ulnar. Lift the flap subfascially from the ulnar side. Outgoing vessels are ligated or bipolized or clipped. Subsequent visualization of the superficial vein system. Visualization of a connection between the superficial and deep venous system. Exposure of the pedicle under the brachioradialis muscle. Then recutting of the flap from the ulnar side. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. Distal exposure of the radial artery, which is first clamped for approx. 10-15 minutes. Always 100% saturation here. The radial artery is then removed. This is treated with 4-0 Prolene sutures proximally and distally using a bypass ligature. Securing suture on the skin area of the flap. The flap is then lifted from caudal to cranial, taking the pedicle with it. Outgoing vessels are ligated or clipped. First clamp the interosseous artery in the elbow area. After consistently good saturation of almost 100 %, clipping or puncture ligation of this. Two outgoing cephalic veins can be seen in the elbow area. The confluence in the area of the radial artery is relatively thin and is also lifted. The flap is then removed. Ligature of the veins, treatment of the edges of the apposition in the area of the brachial artery using 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Flushing of the flap with heparin solution. Split skin is removed from the thigh. This is successively incorporated into the defect on the left forearm. Skin is closed cranially in a typical layered fashion. Subsequent application of octenidine and Mepilex as well as small clouds. Fixation with absorbent cotton. Then fitting of a Cramer splint and fixation of the hand using an elastic bandage. Subsequent application of the hand. Saturation always at 97-100 %, no special features. Then suturing of the radial flap into the defect: This is successively sutured into the defect, which extends from the palatal arch to the base of the tongue or hypopharyngeal entrance. Suturing using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures, partly under a template. Suturing is complete and tension-free. Then anastomosis of the vessels of the flap. Selection of 2 outlets from the facial vein area. The facial artery is selected for the arterial anastomosis. The facial artery is sutured to the radial artery after conditioning with 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial pulse, good venous return, no special features. Subsequent anastomosis of an outlet of the cephalic vein with an outlet from the facial vein using a 3-0 coupler. Again, good venous return after opening the clamp. Positive smear phenomenon. Subsequently, a 2nd outlet from the facial vein is anastomosed with the 2nd outlet from the cephalic vein with a 3.5 mm coupler. No special features here either. Smear phenomenon more positive. Good reflux after opening the clamp. Another small vein is clipped in the area of the flap pedicle. Subsequently, careful positioning of the flap pedicle to prevent kinking. Careful hemostasis is then performed again. Irrigation of the wound area, wound closure in layers on the right side with insertion of 2 flaps. A skin suture is placed in the area of the flap pedicle for Doppler control. On the left side, the skin is closed in the typical layered fashion with the insertion of a Redon drain. The cannula was suture-fixed after insertion. Check of the endaural flap, this is inconspicuously regular. A hydrogel dressing was applied to the thigh area. The procedure was completed without complications. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit postoperatively on mechanical ventilation. Please continue antibiotic treatment, which was started intraoperatively with Unacid 3 g, for a total of 1 week. Nutrition for 10 days via inserted PEG or already inserted PEG tube. Then swallow gruel and if necessary build up the diet. Flap control typically for 5 days by means of Doppler control, but above all clinically transorally. Please run heparin perfusor 500 E/h for 5 days. Overall cT2-3 tonsillar carcinoma, which infiltrated the wall deeply and therefore required flap coverage. Waiting for histology in the area of the cervical lymph nodes, then presentation at the tumor conference.","Tumor resection, Neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy creation

Now they tMonths feeling of pressure on the left side of the tongue. CT scan shows a contrast-absorbing mass on the left edge of the tongue.,"Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: After appropriate preparation, first disinfect the skin. Infiltration with local anesthetic containing adrenaline in the area of the subsequent skin incision. First perform the tracheoscopy. After skin incision, dissection in the median plane through the linea alba onto the isthmus, which is passed underneath. The isthmus is then ligated so that the first 5 tracheal clips can be visualized. Subsequently, visual tracheostomy between the 3rd/4th tracheal clasp with reintubation of the patient. Completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis with 2 sutures each cranially and caudally. Subsequent reintubation of the patient. Now adjust the tumor with the 2nd mouth retractor. Tightening of the tip of the tongue. The tumor is palpable in the posterior quarter of the tongue on the left side in the area of the glossotonsillar groove. Start with dorsal tumor resection, whereby the resection incision is made in the upper third of the tonsil bed and is initially made laterally up to the lower jaw. The tumor area is then resected by palpation at a distance of 1-2 cm towards the front and middle. Thus, under constant palpatory control and at an appropriate safety distance, the tumor is successively separated from the body of the tongue, initially the lateral floor of the mouth, as well as the base of the tongue using the ultrasonic knife. The hypoglossal nerve and the lingual nerve are severed. Finally, the tumor-bearing tissue block can be removed in toto. Macroscopically, the tumor is surrounded on all sides by musculature. Removal of marginal incisions circularly around the defect as well as from the tumor base. These all proved to be tumor-free, only the back of the tongue and the anterior floor of the mouth showed moderate dysplasia, so that resections were carried out here, but these were free of further dysplasia. These areas were also previously furthest away from the tumor, so there is certainly no connection with the tumor here. The main specimen is also examined using frozen section histology and is also found to be R0 in depth into the musculature. Subsequent sterile washing and draping. Transition to neck dissection on the left. After skin incision, regions II to V are successively removed while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. Then evacuation of regions Ia and b and removal of the submandibular gland, with automatic access to the oropharynx. Dissection of the digastric muscle. Dissection of the facial vein as well as a vein located further caudally for subsequent anastomosis. The superior thyroid artery is also dissected, but its caliber is quite small. Therefore, the facial artery is also dissected up to the mandible for later anastomosis. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Acceptance of the operation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Marking of the graft on the forearm 10.5 x 6.5 cm, which was measured by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Start with the flap elevation on the left forearm using <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Expose the brachioradialis muscle for this. Exposure of the cephalic vein. Visualization of the venous star in the antecubital fossa. Exposure of the confluence. Incision of the graft. Exposure of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Exposure of the radial artery, resulting in tearing of a branch from the superficial ramus of the radial nerve that runs to the thumb. This is sutured with 8.0 Prolene. Lifting of the graft from the tendon bed. Dissection of the pedicle up to the crook of the elbow. Removal of the pedicle with two superficial and two deep veins and flushing of the graft with heparin in the usual manner. Removal of full-thickness skin directly from the forearm and thinning of this full-thickness skin. Then preparation of the wound bed on the forearm by approximating the wound edges in the graft harvesting area. Then suturing of the full-thickness skin in the usual manner and turning to the oropharynx and the oral cavity. Inspection of the site again. Hemostasis. It is now clear that the defect is larger than expected and extends to the vallecula in the caudal region. This defect was partially primarily adapted here by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and the soft palate was also partially closed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, in which a part of the healthy side including the uvula was sutured to the left. In the caudal area where the partial primary wound closure in the pharynx took place, a second suture was applied to close the area more tightly. Now insert the flap and start suturing. This is relatively difficult as the graft is quite small for the large defect. In the end, the graft was successfully sutured into place. The stalk was removed into the neck. Then anastomosis between the radial artery and facial artery and anastomosis of the veins through two couplers at the outlets of the internal jugular vein. Insertion of a Penrose drain and two-layer wound closure. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue flap checks according to the usual schedule and antibiotics for at least 24 hours.  ","Transoral TU resection, Left neck dissection, Tracheotomy

Enter with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Problem-free pre-scanning into the stomach. If the diaphansocopy is very good, puncture the stomach without any problems and pull the PEG tube through using the usual suture pull-through method. Inconspicuous esophagus on reflection. Then turn to enoral tumor resection: inspection. The entire left tonsil is found to be tumorously bulging submucosally, the tumor extends close to the uvula, infiltrates the soft palate and extends up to about 1/3 of the posterior pharyngeal wall. The tumor extends towards the buccal and alveolar ridge as well as to the pharyngeal side wall at the level of the hypopharyngeal entrance, transition to the glossotonsillar groove. Contrary to the CT image, the base of the tongue itself is not infiltrated. Now cut around the tumor with the monopolar with a safety margin of at least 1 cm in case of growth into the left uvula base. Subtotal resection of the soft palate. Dissection shows that the tumor has a kind of pseudocapsule and appears relatively well encapsulated. Further excision of the tumor with sufficient safety distance using the dissection technique. Resection close to the alveolar ridge in the posterior region of the molars. All-round removal of the tumor macroscopically in healthy tissue. The carotid artery can be palpated in depth, but no direct contact. In the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, a good displacement layer is already visible above the deep cervical fascia. The tumor can be released in its entirety here. Resection of the right posterior pharyngeal wall via the midline. Resection circumscribed in the area of the glossotonsillar groove, as described above, no infiltration of the base of the tongue. The tumor specimen is thread-marked for final histology. Clearly representative marginal samples are now taken in the entire adjacent mucosal area as well as basally in the area of the upper tonsil pole and in the area of the pharyngeal musculature. Macroscopic resection is most likely here. In frozen section diagnostics, all marginal samples are found to be tumor-free. The result is a subtotal soft palate defect with a defect in the posterior pharyngeal wall extending beyond the midline and to the lateral pharyngeal wall in the area of the transition to the hypopharynx. In addition, circumscribed resection of the glossotonsillar groove and the posterior floor of the mouth. Resection of the right tonsil using the dissection technique, meticulous hemostasis. A defect measuring a maximum of 11 x 7 cm is now measured and an appropriately configured radialis graft is designed. From here, parallel preparation of the neck dissection and the radial distal graft. First for the neck dissection - start with the right side: make a submandibular curved incision. Cut through the skin and the subcutis. Exposure of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma. Creation of a platysmal flap. Exposure of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Sparing of the structures. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Free preparation of the muscle and exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Freeing of the muscle up to the hyoid. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Complete the anterior direction of the hyoid. Expose the entire length of the digaster muscle. Now continue exposing the neck preparation anteriorly. Expose the cervical anus. Expose and preserve the facial vein, expose the hypoglossal nerve and the superior thyroid artery. Now dissect dorsally. Release the accessorius triangle while carefully preserving the nerve and complete level Va while carefully preserving the cervical plexus. Final inspection and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. All the anatomical structures mentioned here were preserved. Now turning to the opposite side: Here, the same procedure was followed in principle. After creating a platysmal flap, expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric nerve. During dissection of the internal jugular vein, several tributaries to the internal jugular vein are visible here (as well as on the opposite side) in addition to the facial vein. These are all spared. In the area of the jugulo-facial angle, a lymph node of conspicuous size and shape is now visible on the left. Release the specimen anteriorly while also sparing and exposing the hypoglossal nerve, cervical artery and superior thyroid artery. Complete the neck dorsally while carefully protecting the accessorius nerve and the cervical plexus. Now remove the digastric muscle. Further dissection and performance of a pharyngotomy below the tonsil lobe. Creation of an approx. 3-finger wide access. Radialis graft: First identify the cephalic vein. Marking of the graft. A skin monitor is also lifted. Application of the tourniquet to 300 mmHg. Skin incision and preparation of a skin flap while carefully preserving the subcutaneous vascular tissue. Exposure of the cephalic vein. Strictly subfascial dissection and performance of the Hayden maneuver. Identification of the superficial ramus and radial nerve. Both branches can be exposed and preserved. Now expose the vascular pedicle. Blunt exposure of the radial artery with its accompanying veins. Ligation of the vascular pedicle. Now successive lifting of the graft under strictly subfascial preparation. Develop the graft cranially while carefully supplying the feeding vessels. A classic vein pattern with cubital outlet of the cephalic vein can be seen in the area of the antecubital fossa. In the area of the cubital fossa, the anatomy is also classic with a regular outlet of the interosseous artery and the ulnar artery. A broad vascular bridge of the deep venous area of the radial artery and the superficial outflow area can now also be seen. Now open the tourniquet. Minutious hemostasis. Regular or excellent flap perfusion with regular arm perfusion. Deposition of the graft after ligation of the remaining draining and supplying vessels. Then removal of full-thickness skin from the right groin. Skin incision for this. Strict cutaneous preparation. Careful hemostasis and, after skin mobilization, careful, multi-layered subcutaneous closure with moderate tension and skin suturing. Prior to this, insertion of a 10 Redon drain. Now inspection of the forearm. Final hemostasis and, if the wound is dry, careful two-layer wound closure and insertion of the full-thickness skin graft and final treatment with a vacuum sealing dressing and application of the Cramer splint. Now to the suturing of the graft. Start suturing the graft transorally. First suturing of the dorsal resection border, suturing of the palatal arch replacement in the area of the tonsil lobe, especially in the area of the transition to the glossotonsillar groove and the posterior floor of the mouth. Extremely difficult suturing conditions, also in the area of the pharyngeal side wall. Difficult suturing due to poor accessibility, but finally a tight and gap-free fit. The caudal end of the flap must be sutured in transcervically. Here, after exposing the pharyngotomy, relatively problem-free suturing. Here too, good adaptation with an overall adequate flap size. Now turn to the vascular anastomosis. The superior thyroid artery is further exposed, clamped and dissected free. Vascular anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. Slightly more difficult due to the position of the vessel, but overall without complications. After opening the clamp, good and tight vascular anastomosis with good flow and good venous return. Now select the venous vessel with the better return flow. Clip the 2nd vein. Measure a 2.5 mm coupler. Expose and carefully dissect the facial venous branch. Deposition after clipping and coupler anastomosis. In this case, the posterior part of the coupler cannot be placed correctly so that a sufficient anastomosis cannot be created. The coupler must therefore be removed. At the next attempt, coupler placement without complications, also with 2.5 mm density and sufficient anastomosis with good arterial and venous flow. Regular blood supply to the skin monitor, so that after flap application, the wound was carefully closed in two layers in dry wound conditions. A tracheotomy had already been performed previously due to the size of the defect, the size of the flap and the tongue swelling that occurred during the incision. For this purpose, the skin incision was made horizontally, sparingly below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Splitting of the musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea and insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a Björk flap and performance of the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Finally, problem-free reintubation to an 8-gauge cannula with inner core and completion of the procedure, overall without any indication of complications. Conclusion: R0 resection of a cT3 cN1 tonsillar carcinoma on the left. The antibiotic treatment with Unacid 3 g started intraoperatively should be continued for at least 24 hours. The sutured cannula should be left in place until the 5th postoperative day. Leave the Cramer splint and Vac bandage in place for 7 days. A diet can be started from the 8th postoperative day if the flap is healing well. However, findings should be checked by the surgeon beforehand.","Tumor resection, Right tonsillectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Plastic tracheotomy, PEG

Inconspicuous mucosal conditions can be seen here. Inversion without any problems. After safe diaphanoscopy, PEG placement is performed in the typical manner using the thread pull-through method. Pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The well-known tumor measuring approx. 2 x 3 cm can be seen in the area of the tonsil on the left side. On the right side in the area of the uvula as well as the posterior pharyngeal wall, the piriform sinus on both sides, the esophageal entrance and the entire endolarynx, the mucosal conditions are unremarkable. No evidence of exophytic tumor growth. Enoral tumor resection: insertion of the Mc Ivor blade. Establish the resection margins with sufficient safety distance using the electric needle.

Separation of the platysma. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection of the medial part of the muscle. Exposure of the digastricus venter posterior muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Then expose the accessorius nerve and the internal jugular vein. The internal jugular vein is now successively exposed. Then explore the anterior galenic muscle in the caudal region. Now successively dissect the neck preparation caudally with careful bipolar coagulation. Then dissect and clear the accessorius triangle. Release the lateral neck preparation from cranial to caudal while protecting the plexus branches. Then careful hemostasis with the bipolar. Now dissect the facial vein and the submandibular gland. Then evacuation of the venous angle with exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. The capsule of the submandibular gland is also removed in the caudal part. Finally, the caudal part of the medial neck preparation is removed. This allows the cervical anus to be spared. Then rinse with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Careful hemostasis. Insertion of a 10 mm Redon drain. Cutaneous suture. Skin suture. After obtaining the frozen section, the patient is repositioned again. The frozen section shows a carcinoma in situ in the area of the median margin. The decision is therefore made to resect. The electric needle is now used to carefully resect again. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Insertion of two hydrogen swabs. The specimen is sent for final histology. Finally, no cervical structures are exposed in the area of the oral cavity. Now repositioning for neck dissection on the left side: skin disinfection. Local anesthesia. Renewed, approx. 15 cm long curved skin incision in the area of the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and exposure of the muscle in its median portion. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the posterior digastric muscle. An extensive, firmly attached lymph node bundle is now visible in the area of level II, which appears to be directly adjacent to the accessorius nerve and the internal jugular vein. The accessorius nerve is shown in its caudal course. The internal jugular vein is also dissected in its caudal course. The anterior scalene muscle is now explored in the caudal region. The internal jugular vein is now dissected from caudal to cranial. The neck preparation is then placed in the caudal region. This is done with careful bipolar coagulation. The thoracic duct is not exposed. The facial vein is then exposed in the cranial region and the venous angle is dissected. The hypoglossal nerve is successfully exposed. Then, with great difficulty, the lymph node conglomerate is detached from the internal jugular vein and the venous angle is dissected. The accessorius nerve is now dissected further cranially. This results in the opening of an apparently necrotic, disintegrating lymph node. The escaping fluid is suctioned out with the aspirator. The lymph node conglomerate is then removed while sparing the accessorius nerve. Now there is a much better overview. The entire course of the accessory nerve can now be visualized. The accessorius triangle is then evacuated. This is done with careful hemostasis. Further suspicious lymph nodes are also clinically present here. These are now successively removed. Expose the internal jugular vein in its entire course from caudal to cranial. Subsequently, successive dissection of the lateral neck preparation and removal of the same with careful hemostasis. Due to the adhesions in the cranial area, some smaller branches of the cervical plexus are also resected. The cervical plexus itself can be preserved. The caudal medial neck preparation is then removed while sparing the cervical nerve. In addition, removal of the caudal part of the capsule of the submandibular gland. Careful hemostasis and irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Subcutaneous suture. Skin suture. Now reposition again for endoral inspection: the inserted hydrogen swabs are now removed. Careful hemostasis again with the bipolar. The operation is then completed without bleeding or complications. Conclusion: Enormous tumor resection of a T2 tonsillar carcinoma on the left. First CIS in the median part in the frozen section, therefore decision to resect. Problem-free PEG placement. Neck dissection on both sides, levels 1b to 5, with clinically suspicious lymph nodes on the left side in levels 1b, 2 and 3.","Panendoscopy, PEG, Enoral tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection

In each case a papilloma with no evidence of malignancy. No other findings in the ENT area, no history of noxious substances, no preoperative CT neck/thorax, preoperative B-scan sonography cN0 neck status. Therefore indication for the above procedure. The patient had sufficient opportunity to ask questions about this preoperatively.","After active patient identification, anesthesia is first induced by the anesthesia colleagues, rigid tracheobronchoscopy using O° optics and intubation by the first surgeon. Then transition to esophagogastroscopy, here insertion of the esophagoscope using a laryngoscope, passage of the upper sphincter is successful without any problems. Pre-mirroring into the stomach, air insufflation there by inversion, inconspicuous mucosal conditions on all sides. After aspiration of the air, slowly move back with the esophagoscope and inspect the gastroesophageal junction and the entire esophageal wall. Unobtrusive aspect on all sides. Enter with the Kleinsasser tube size C. In the edentulous maxilla, inspection of the oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx as well as the base of the tongue. Inconspicuous aspect on all sides. There is no mass, smooth mucosa on all sides with very good visibility overall, final palpation of the base of the tongue without pathological findings. Now insertion of a spandex mouth retractor and suturing of the tongue, inspection of the tongue. Here, on the left, the previously described, coarsely palpable, but well demarcated from the surrounding tongue tissue and also well displaceable in relation to it, a mass approx. 5 x 3 cm in size and approx. 2 cm thick, in the anterior and upper 2/3 smooth aspect, caudal whitish verrucous aspect, overall not contact-vulnerable. After demonstrating the findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>, this was carefully excised from anterior to posterior in the healthy tissue using a diode laser and sent for histological processing with a suture marker.

The CT scan showed a mediastinal lymph node metastasis or lung metastasis. Bronchoscopy showed no evidence of malignancy, but a single round focus, which is .................. suspected of being malignant. This should be removed by thoracic surgery following surgical repair.","At the beginning of the operation, after induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues, a pharyngoscopy was performed to determine the exact extent of the tumor. An exophytic tumor was found in the area of the left tonsillar lobe, which almost filled the tonsillar lobe, but without significant involvement of the posterior pharyngeal wall or extensive transition into the soft palate. The tumor extends over the glossotonsillar groove into the base of the tongue and the edge of the tongue if the posterior floor of the mouth is intact. The edge of the tongue is clearly affected on the free lateral surface. Exulcerated tumor here. Anteriorly only the marginal area is infiltrated. The width of the tumor increases dorsally. Significant infiltration of the base of the tongue. Almost half of this is palpatorily infiltrated. Inspection of the vallecula. This is again free of tumor, as is the lateral wall of the pharynx. Palpatorily clear cervical lymph node metastasis as a conglomerate on the left. The rest of the pharynx and the endolarynx are clear. PEG tube was therefore initially inserted. Insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Problem-free pre-scanning into the stomach. After good diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual suture pull-through method. Subsequent repositioning of the patient. First start with the enoral resection. Here, the tumor is first cut around with the electric needle. Then further dissection using the dissection technique. The left edge of the tongue is released while maintaining a safety distance of approx. 1.5 cm. Resection up to the edge of the tongue. Release of the tumor and lateral displacement, additional release of the part of the tonsil region. Deposition hard on the uvula, taking the anterior palatal arch with it. Resection up to the alveolar ridge while maintaining the safety distance. Partial removal of the pharyngeal muscles. Subsequent partial exposure of the soft tissue of the neck. Macroscopically, complete in sano conditions on all sides, as well as in the area of the sedimentation margins in the area of the mucosa. Release of the glossotonsillar groove and circumscribed involvement of the posterior floor of the mouth. Here, the tumor moves slightly into the depth, also poor overview in the area of the base of the tongue, therefore no further transoral resection is performed here. The area resected so far is completely covered with margin samples and diagnosed as in sano in the frozen section diagnostics. Now reposition for neck dissection on the left. To do this, make a curved skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is partially displaced. Free preparation of the muscle. When exposing the muscle, a clear infiltration can be seen approximately in the middle of the course. Therefore, after exposing the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is exposed caudally and later cranially on the mastoid. After dissection of the borders, the internal jugular vein is now exposed. This shows that the metastasis clearly infiltrates the venous angle. Longer infiltration of the internal jugular vein and the outlet of the facial vein. Careful release of the metastasis in the area of the veins to preserve the superior thyroid vein and the cranial facial drainage. After removal of the internal jugular vein and mobilization of the metastasis, which is also partly located in the cervical plexus, a further extensive metastasis of approx. 4 x 5 cm is now visible behind the internal jugular vein. This infiltrates the internal jugular vein at the back, hence the caudal separation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure and preservation of the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Caudal evacuation of level V, also here several nodes, so that level V b is also evacuated. Here without visible visualization of the thoracic duct, but lymph leakage. Selective bipolar coagulation, if lymph leakage persists, later repositioning of the tissue and in case of incomplete reduction, application of TachoSil and TaboTamp. Evacuation and completion of the neck preparation with evacuation of level I b and level II a. The accessorius nerve was already resected in the 1st metastasis. After exposure of the entire digastric muscle, resection of the muscle, careful removal of the submandibular gland from the surrounding tissue, carefully preserving the cranially preserved facial branches. First expose and preserve the facial artery. This and the lingual artery are later dissected and removed. After releasing the submandibular gland with uncinate process from the floor of the mouth, tunneling to the resection area. Partial resection of the mylohyoid muscle with widening of the pharyngotomy. Entering the posterior floor of the mouth. Widening of the pharyngotomy and successive release and mobilization of the tumour. The entire soft tissue covering the outside of the tumor in the area of the floor of the mouth and cervically is removed. Exposure and exposure of the base of the tongue after extending the pharyngotomy caudally. Now a good overview and macroscopic complete resection of the base of the tongue. Due to the alteration and manipulation of the tissue, only a thin ridge remains between the tumor part in the tonsil region and the tumor part at the base of the tongue after excision of the tumor. The site is marked with a corresponding suture and the tumor is sent for definitive histology. This is followed by the taking of marginal samples, completely covering all edges. These are diagnosed in the area of the base of the tongue caudally, close to the tumor, with discrete residual infiltrates. Due to the thickness of the post-resectate, however, a minimum safety margin of 9 mm is required here. Otherwise, all other tumor margin samples are clear, so that an R0 situation can be assumed here. Now measure a lobulated graft measuring approx. 13 x 9 cm in total. Turn to graft harvesting from the right thigh. Here, after identification of the main perforator and 3 further secondary perforators by Doppler sonography, marking of the graft. Medial incision. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and secure identification of the rectus femoris muscle. Slinging of the muscle. Strictly subfascial dissection. Identification of the pedicle vessel. Performing an extension incision. Further dissection of the pedicle and isolation. Release of the fascia above the intermedius portion. Complete cutting of the graft. Removal of the fascia lata. Caudal fascio cutaneous graft. Most of the perforators run with a small intramuscular course. Therefore use of a muscle cuff. Careful protection of the perforators. Isolation on the vascular pedicle and preparation of a strong artery and two draining veins with good confluence if the flap is properly vitalized. Deposition of the graft. Careful wound inspection. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure with local balancing plasty in the area of excess skin. Neck dissection on the right side and plastic tracheotomy were performed at the same time. Neck dissection on the right: skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the digastric muscle after exposure of the submandibular gland. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Preservation of the middle thyroid vein and the facial vein. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the hypoglossal nerve and the superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Evacuation of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and evacuation of level V with protection of the cervical plexus branches. Finally, wound inspection and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Tracheostomy: Insertion approx. 1 cm below the tracheostoma. Cut the skin and subcutaneous tissue horizontally. Exposure and ligation of the anterior jugular vein. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Entering the linea alba. Exposure of the anterior surface of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Exposure and transection of the thyroid isthmus after perforation. Complete visualization of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and careful incision of the tracheostoma on all sides. In the case of small dehiscence for neck dissection with extensive resection, the paralaryngeal muscles are later adapted with the subcutaneous tissue so that reasonably tight conditions can be created here. The patient is then reintubated, initially onto an 8 mm tube and later onto a cannula with an inner core. This succeeds without any problems. Suture fixation of the cannula. The transplant is then inserted. This is done step by step transorally and transcervically. Gradual incorporation of the graft. This works well with a good fit. Good volume filling in the area of the base of the tongue. Intact conditions. The resection area extends caudally into the vallecula and in the area of the pharynx up to the entrance of the piriform sinus. After complete incision, dissection of the flap vascular pedicle. Thrombosis of the partially detached superior thyroid artery is now evident. Despite cutting back the artery, no equivalent blood flow and clear thrombosis. Therefore ligation. Also thrombosis of the detached facial and lingual arteries. Dissection of the transverse cervical artery. This has a widely tortuous course. Free dissection of the artery, providing good opportunities for rotation. Perform the arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. This works very well. Tight conditions and immediate venous return flow. Now first dissection of an upper thyroid vein. This now shows clear thrombosis. Repeated irrigation with heparin does not lead to any relevant reflux. The facial vein is now dissected in the caudal direction. There is a branched course with palpatorily clear flow. After opening, the flow is regular so that this vein can now be used for connection after maximum mobilization of the artery. Performing the venous anastomosis with Coupler 3.5, which works well. Moderate tension conditions in relation to the arterial anastomosis. Regular flap vitality on inspection. Final inspection of the wound surfaces. Despite all the measures in level V b, there is still moderate lymphatic leakage after the above measures have been carried out, here with TachoSil and TaboTamp. Due to the arterial anastomosis via the arteria transversa cevicis, no further transpositions were necessary. Insertion of a guided 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. At the end of the operation, regular flap vitality and transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT3 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left with approx. 2/3 resection of the base of the tongue. Due to the extensive metastasis and aggressive local growth, adjuvant therapy is certainly urgently required. Please leave the cannula in place as long as possible postoperatively, for approx. 6 to 7 days, if the tracheostoma is clearly close to the left side of the neck with complex anastomosis. Depending on the left cervical lymph leakage, please start with conservative treatment. Strict avoidance of pressure bandages. Leave the 10 Redon drain in place until the flow rate is significantly reduced. Pull the Redon drainage by the surgeon. If the wound is healing properly, perform an X-ray gruel on the 10th postoperative day. Due to the extent of the tumor, the reconstruction and the patient's constitution, prolonged swallowing rehabilitation is to be expected. Depending on recovery of the general condition, planning of thoracic surgery to repair the round lung tumor.","Resection, Neck dissection, Plastic tracheotomy, Free flap (ALT), PEG placement

Exposure of the hyoid bone. Removal of the hyoid bone. Skeletonization of the larynx so that in the anterior region .............. Release of the piriform sinus on both sides. Then enter the mouth with the large Langenbeck spatula and lift the base of the tongue. Perform the pharyngotomy at this point. Pull out the epiglottis and open the pharynx along the epiglottis. This is very easy on the right side, on the left side the tumor appears to have grown into the medial area of the piriform sinus, so the mucosa must be removed more generously here. The entire larynx is detached so that it is only attached to the trachea and the cricoid cartilage. The larynx is removed below the cricoid cartilage and sent for a frozen section. The pathologist can no longer detect any tumor in the edges of the incision and the specimen is therefore resected in sano in the frozen section. Then transition to insertion of a Provox prosthesis. Entry with the trocar and creation of a tracheoesophageal fistula and insertion of a size 10 Provox prosthesis using the pull-through method. Then perform a posteromedial esophagomyotomy on the left side. Perform a myotomy on the sternocleidomastoid muscle to flatten the tracheostoma. Performing the pharyngeal suture with single button sutures. Perform another pharyngeal suture over the first pharyngeal suture, also with single button sutures. The constrictor pharyngeal muscle is then adapted as well as possible. This cannot be done in all places so that the pharynx does not narrow, but so that the largest part of the 3rd pharyngeal suture is still covered. Insertion of 2 Redon drainage tubes. Cut out the skin on the tracheostoma, as it is massively macerated by the previously placed tracheostoma. Then suture the skin to the trachea. Fold back the apron flap and complete the mucocutaneous anastomosis in the tracheal area and close the wound in two layers. Please do not feed orally postoperatively and carry out an X-ray gruel swallow after 10 days, then build up the diet when the pharyngeal suture is tight.","Laryngectomy, Neck dissection, and Tracheotomy with Voice Prosthesis

Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the pharynx and larynx area. In the pharynx, an extensive exophytic mass can be seen in the area of the oropharynx, in the area of the tonsil lobe, infiltrating the anterior and posterior palatal arch and parts of the soft palate. The other pharyngeal areas and the larynx are unremarkable. Sterile washing and draping. Start with neck dissection on the right and left side in parallel. Right side, start with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Skin incision so that the large cystic metastasis is cut around. A large area of skin must also be resected. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the caudal region. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and exposure of the capsule of the mass. Dissection of the lower part of the internal jugular vein. Then take over by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and further release of the mass. The mass must be pushed away from the carotid artery. This is achieved without any problems in the area of the common carotid artery. In the bulb area, it can be seen that the external carotid artery is infiltrated by the tumor. The internal jugular vein is then ligated and the mass removed, taking with it the sternocleidomastoid muscle with which the mass has grown together. The hypoglossal nerve is also infiltrated and must be severed as well as the accessorius nerve. The plexus branches of the cervical plexus can be preserved. The vagus nerve can also be preserved. Ultimately, the entire neck preparation with the metastasis is removed en bloc. Only the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery as well as the vagus nerve and the border cord remain. At the same time, perform the neck dissection on the left side through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Neck dissection on the left: Skin incision, transection of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Subplatysmal dissection and elevation of the apron flap. Suturing of the apron flap. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissection along the muscle in depth until the cervical plexus is exposed. Identification of the omohyoid muscle and dissection along the muscle to the hyoid bone. Identification of the accessorius nerve and the digastric muscle. Dissection medially to the hyoid bone. Release of the submandibular gland, which is left in place during dissection. Identification of the hypoglossal nerve. This can be safely spared. Dissection along the vein from caudal to cranial and detachment of the neck preparation. Sending in levels II, III, IV and V in individual preparations. Irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer and completion of the neck dissection on the left side without complications. Insertion of the tonsil plug and inspection of the tumor region. Incision of the tumor region with a safety margin of at least 1 cm in the oropharynx using the electric needle. Dissection with the needle as well as with scissors and bipolar forceps. The preparation is obtained en bloc and is placed on cork for frozen section. In the frozen section, all margins and also basal R0. The tumor resection creates a defect towards the neck. The tumor itself had no contact with the large metastasis and was still separated from it by a thin layer of tissue. Now measurement of the defect and lifting of the radialis graft from the left forearm by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Lifting the radialis graft: Marking the graft on the distal forearm on the left side. S-shaped skin incision and proximal forearm. Exposure of the confluence and dissection of a superficial vein (cephalic vein) up to the radial flap edge. Incision along the marked skin incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the forearm fascia and subfascial preparation of the radialis graft. Care is taken to protect the external ramus of the radial nerve, particularly at the radial end. The ulnar artery can also be safely spared. Dissection of the distal section of the radial artery and ligation of the radial artery after prior control by clamping with a vascular clip. A good perfusion signal can be measured on the index finger during clamping. Then preparation of the radial artery graft from the depth under constant bipolar coagulation and placement of vessel clips on the perforator vessels. Dissection up to the crook of the elbow, reliable identification of the brachial artery, the ulnar artery and the interosseous artery. Separation of the radial artery after the exit of the interosseous artery. Separation of the veins and irrigation of the graft with heparin. Lift the split skin from the right thigh using <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Insertion of the graft from transcervical and transoral through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Creation of the arterial and venous anastomosis. Arterial to the superior thyroid artery, venous to the facial vein and a second vein. The anastomosis is located on the left side. The stalk was guided over the larynx to the left. Then skin suture in the area of the left side of the neck and a second graft must be lifted to close the right side of the neck. A pectoralis major graft was harvested from the right side for this purpose. To do this, cut around a skin island 8 x 4 cm medial to the nipple. Then dissect down to the thoracic wall. Lifting of the petoral muscle from the thoracic wall. Detachment of the attachment of the pecotralis muscle from the sternum and humerus. The pedicle is clearly identified. The graft is pulled through a tunnel representing the theoretical deltopectoral flap. The deltopectoral flap was not lifted off, but only tunneled under medially.

Entering with the esophagogastroscope. Pre-viewing into the stomach. Inconspicuous conditions on all sides. Perform the PEG insertion with good diaphanoscopy using the thread pull-through method. This is successful without any problems. Entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the hypopharynx and larynx. In the laryngeal region, a whitish deposit can be seen on the anterior third of the left vocal fold, which extends to the anterior commissure. Advance the microscope and remove this deposit while protecting the vocal folds. Microlaryngoscopically, the deposit looks like a leukoplakia. There is no indication of a polyp. Then insertion of the retractor and inspection of the tonsil region. On the right side, a crater-shaped change can be seen at the lower pole of the tonsil. The tonsil itself is also rough. Start of tumor tonsillectomy with incision of the mucosa and exposure of the upper pole. Removal of the tonsil, taking some of the musculature from the tonsil bed and taking part of the base of the tongue with it. This guarantees a sufficient safety margin. The lateral border to the neck is still intact. The tonsil is suture-marked to the frozen section. Unfortunately, the previously biopsied squamous cell carcinoma can no longer be found in the frozen section, but the margins are definitely clear, i.e. definitely an R0 situation. After consultation with the pathology department, the squamous cell carcinoma is to be looked for more precisely in the final histology. Neck dissection performed in the meantime. Transverse skin incision for this. Separation of the platysma. Formation of a platysma flap. Then expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. Then free preparation of the vein. Level II shows a very large metastasis, Level II b shows several smaller ones and Level III and IV also show enlarged, coarse lymph nodes. Removal of the neck specimen en bloc while sparing the plexus branches. The large metastasis in level II can be easily detached from the internal jugular vein, but its tip extends very far towards the border of the oropharynx, creating a very small, 0.5 x 0.5 cm fistula to the oropharynx. This fistula is sutured over several times and the stylohyoid muscle and the posterior belly of the digaster are sutured over it for safety. A tracheotomy is then performed. For this, a skin incision is made below the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the musculature. Entering the linea alba. Pushing the muscles aside. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Insertion of an 8-bore tracheal cannula. Suturing of the 8 mm tracheostomy tube. Then re-inspection of the oropharynx. The wound area is very large, so that the tracheostomy is definitely justified. Stitching over tissue in the potential fistula area. The operation was completed without complications. No oral food for 5 days please. If there are signs of fistula, open the neck. Insertion of a flap and irrigation so that the saliva can drain and then wait, as the fistula is really very small.","Resection, Neck dissection, and PEG placement

Positioning of the patient. Laryngoscopic insertion of the flexible esophagoscope into the esophagus. Mirroring under visualization into the stomach, where a regular folded relief can be seen. If the diaphanoscopy is positive, the PEG tube is placed in the typical position using the thread pull-through method. This was successful without any problems. The patient was given an antibiotic cover intraoperatively. When withdrawing the esophagoscope, careful inspection of the esophageal mucosa, which is normal and inconspicuous. Dressing is applied. Reposition the patient for transoral laser resection. To do this, adjust the supraglottic plane with the spreading laryngoscope. The tumor extends laterally over the entire right arytenoid cusp up to the pharyngoepiglottic fold and the medial piriform sinus wall. The tumor is cut around with the CO2 laser and carefully dissected in a circular fashion with a sufficient safety margin. Vascular inflows are repeatedly monopolar coagulated during the dissection. Part of the pharyngoepiglottic fold is successfully preserved. It is also possible to preserve most of the cartilaginous arytenoid and only partially resect it. The tumor certainly does not reach the tip of the piriform sinus and can also be removed here with a sufficient safety margin far above the esophageal entrance level. In the area of the Arys, take a representative sample of the edge, which is described intraoperatively as tumor-free. In the area of the other resection margins, the tumor appears to be resected far in sano, so that only marginal samples are sent for final histology. These completely depict the tumor resection. Subsequent subtle hemostasis using monopolar coagulation. Dry wound conditions and very good aspect. If the wound conditions are dry and the arytenoid is standing, the tracheostomy can be omitted here. The patient should be fed via the PEG tube for the first few postoperative days. Then slowly build up the diet with porridge. Transfer the patient for neck dissection on both sides. Start with the neck dissection on the right side. Make an incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissect in depth in layers and expose the cervical vascular sheath. Separate the neck preparation over the cervical vascular sheath. A conglomerate of enlarged lymph nodes can be seen in the area of the vein angle. Exposure of the resection borders with the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digaster. Exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve. Long-distance dissection of the cervical vascular sheath with long-distance dissection of the vagus nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve, hypoglossal nerve and vagus nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Subsequent resection of the lateral neck preparation together with the accessorius triangle. Removal of the hypoglossal triangle and then the ventral neck preparation. The final result is a resection of levels Ib to V. All outlets of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery can be preserved during dissection. Careful irrigation of the wound. Dry wound conditions. Insertion of a size 10 Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure dressing. Neck dissection of the left side. Almost identical procedure here. This also results in the dissection of levels Ib to V. All vessels in the sense of the branches of the internal jugular vein and the external carotid artery can also be preserved here. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. No conspicuous nodes were found in the area of the left neck during dissection. Dry wound conditions. Irrigation of the neck and insertion of a size 10 Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure dressing. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Completion of the procedure.","Laser resection, Bilateral neck dissection, PEG placement

Tumor is incised on all sides with a safety margin of more than 1 cm and removed. Goes to pathology marked with a suture. In addition, a marginal sample from the soft tissues is also sent to the frozen section as a craniobasal marginal sample. Here in the frozen section all specimens are healthy. Thus R0 resection. Repositioning for neck dissection on both sides: skin disinfection, draping. Start with the right side: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Large cranial metastasis. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal and external carotid artery, internal jugular vein and vagus nerve as well as the accessorius and hypoglossal nerves. Subsequent development of the dorsal neck preparation. Knots can be detached from all structures, sometimes with some difficulty. Development of the dorsal neck preparation ........................., clearing also level V a and b. Subsequent development of the anterior neck preparation with visualization and preservation of the superior thyroid artery and hypoglossal nerve. Here now also revision level I b. Here, some lymph nodes in front of and behind the submandibular gland, including its capsule, are also removed. This ultimately results in partial level I and II to V removal. Neck dissection on the left: This is performed in the same way as on the right side, exposing the structures described. Levels II to IV are removed here in a typical manner. Significantly enlarged cranial lymph nodes are also seen here. Then hemostasis and irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution and layered wound closure and insertion of a Redon drain. Subsequent PEG insertion: This is performed with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Advance the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach. No abnormalities on rough examination. A 9 mm abdominal wall probe is inserted in the typical manner. Then fixation to the abdominal wall. Now an enoral check: the site is unremarkable after an extended tonsillectomy without bleeding.

The exphytically growing tumor in the area of the right tonsil region can be seen, passing over to the base of the tongue towards the valecula. The piriform sinus on both sides, the visible larynx and the base of the tongue on the left are unremarkable. Oedematous mucosa was probably noticed on CT. Now detailed consultation with the anesthesiologist regarding the intraoperative procedure. Due to the small mouth opening, the tumor can only be extirpated by splitting the lower jaw. Therefore, senior physician <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the maxillofacial surgery department will be informed later about the mandibular division. First of all, start again with the PEG placement. Very difficult insertion of the flexible esophagoscope into the upper esophageal opening. Due to the very narrow conditions, it is finally possible to enter the oesophagus. Advance into the stomach. Inconspicuous conditions there. Good diaphanoscopy. Puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube. This cannot be pulled through, so check again with the MLE tube. There is a snag in the area of the tube. The tube is therefore removed again from the cranial side. Careful insertion of the flexible endoscope again. The esophagus is unremarkable. No evidence of perforation, advancement into the stomach. No bleeding there either, unremarkable conditions. Another puncture of the stomach and now problem-free insertion of the PEG tube. Perioperative administration of Unacid i.v.. Continue this postoperatively. Now start of neck dissection on the right side with preparation for splitting the lower jaw. To do this, make a skin incision in the area of the lower lip, moving onto the chin, onto the submandibular region and finally into the scar for neck dissection from the earlobe to the supraclavicular region. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, the facial vein and individual smaller veins. Exposure of the vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, digastric muscle, posterior vena cava. Very difficult dissection of metastatically altered lymph nodes from the jugular vein in the cranial part. Further dissection of the posterior neck preparation up to the supraclavicular region. There, the preparation was removed and repositioned to prevent a fistula. Now dissection of the hypoglossal nerve and the submandibular gland. Dissection of the anterior neck preparation with exposure of the external and internal carotid artery as well as the superior thyroid artery and the facial artery. The submandibular gland is also removed. To do this, dissect from the facial vein towards the mylohyoid muscle and cut and ligate the excretory duct. Removal of the submandibular gland. Neck dissection is also carried out in regions I and II a and b. All lymph nodes in the area of the facial vein medial to the mandible are removed and also included in the preparation. Now call in <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the maxillofacial surgery department. He first fits a plate in the area of the lower jaw with eight screws. The lower jaw is then split in a staircase between the canine and the first molar. After opening the lower jaw, the muscles of the floor of the mouth are cut through and dissected in the direction of the tumor. Now very difficult resection of the tumor, initially in the area of the laternal tongue and the base of the tongue. Then further laterally into the upper retromolar region towards the hard and soft palate. Here, a large part of the hard and soft palate falls down to the uvula. Dissection of the tumor then in the depth of the pterygoid muscle. The tumor can be further detached here. It is now possible to remove the tumor in toto in the block with great effort. Circular marginal samples are taken and sent for frozen section. Result: All marginal samples are considered to be tumor-free, and the biopsy from the left valecula, which was also performed, shows no evidence of tumor. An A0 situation can be assumed. Now reposition the patient. Removal of the ALT. Then perform the neck dissection on the left side. Also make a skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, from the earlobe to the jugulum. Dissection of the muscle, exposure of the internal jugular vein, the vagus nerve and the accessorius nerve. Dissection of the accessorius triangle after exposure of the digastric muscle, posterior vena cava. Dissection of the neck preparation caudally. Deposition supraclavicularly after repositioning. Finally, dissection of the facial vein, the external and internal carotid arteries and the hypoglossal nerve. Complete the anterior neck preparation, including the submandibular gland. Complete hemostasis with H2O2 swabs and bipolar coagulation. No more bleeding. Insertion of a Redon drainage, subcutaneous suture, skin suture and wound dressing. In this area. Now perform the tracheotomy. Y-shaped skin incision in the longitudinal direction. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue, exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Opening of the same in the area of the linea alba, exposure of the thyroid isthmus and the cricoid cartilage. Separation and transection of the thyroid isthmus. The trachea is now exposed and opened. Creation of a Björ flap. Opening of the trachea so that an 8 mm tube can be inserted without difficulty. Re-intubation of the patient and epithelization of the tracheostoma with non-absorbable sutures and simultaneous application of skin sutures in this area. Now the ALT taken from the thigh, which is sized accordingly, is fitted into the tumor resection area. Incision with several Vicryl sutures, initially in the area of the naso- and oropharynx. Very difficult conditions here. However, the flap now fits very well. Suturing in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, extending to the base of the tongue and the mandibular region as well as in the retromolar region. Very good fit of the flap. Now primary suture in the area of the floor of the mouth, both the musculature and the mucosa. Call in <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the MKG. He closes and sutures the lower jaw and reattaches the perforated plate with eight screws for fixation. Very good fit. Occlusion fits. Now suction of wound secretions in the neck area and exposure of the superior thyroid artery and a large neck vein, which are well suited for anastomosis. First anastomosis of the artery. The artery is first anastomosed at the end. There are several leaks, so that the anastomosis is first cut once again and in the second attempt an anastomosis is achieved under microscopic control. Very good flow in the area of the artery. No leakage of blood. Repeated flushing with heparin. Finding the venous limb of the flap and dissection of a jugular vein. Using the coupler, the two venous ends can be approximated and anastomosed end-to-end. Very difficult dissection. Repeated irrigation with heparin. The venous return flow increases significantly over time, so that the arterial limb functions very well. After performing the coupler anastomosis, venous return is also very good. Flap well perfused. Adaptation of the anastomosis in the neck area. Now again thorough hemostasis with H2O2 irrigation and bipolar coagulation. No more bleeding. Insertion of Redon drains, subcutaneous and skin sutures. Closure also in the area of the lower lip and chin. No bleeding at the end of the operation. Detailed consultation with the anesthesiologist. Repeated administration of Unacid. Please pass this on postoperatively, paying particular attention to abdominal problems due to the two PEG insertions. Detailed consultation with the anesthesia department. The patient is intubated and ventilated and transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. This is followed by the surgical report for lifting the ALT flap of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. After identification of the landmarks, doppler sonographic identification of the main perforator and three small secondary perforators. After measuring the graft configuration for soft palate and tongue base. Initial medial incision and separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue, visualization of the rectus femoris muscle, strictly subpartial preparation. Reliable identification of the muscle, visualization of the very strong main perforator, therefore limitation to the main perforator. Identification of the strong vascular pedicle. Complete cutting of the graft. This shows a purely fasciocutaneous graft. A relatively thin graft can therefore be lifted here. Completely recut, taking the fascia lata in the graft area with it. Careful protection of the main perforator, leaving a small muscle cuff in the area of the perforator outlet. Isolation on the vascular pedicle, exposure of the confluence of the veins, exposure of the strong artery. Protection of the ramus obliquus and, if the vitality of the graft is excellent, removal of the graft. Careful wound inspection, insertion of a 10-gauge redon drain and careful multi-layer wound closure. The graft is then implanted transmandibularly.","Resection, Neck dissection, Free flap coverage (ALT)

Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Cranial exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the posterior neck area with careful protection and exposure of the cervical plexus roots. Macroscopically no conspicuous nodules here. Careful hemostasis. Turning to the opposite side. Now the same primary procedure on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle while preserving the external jugular vein. Free preparation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland and exposure of the digastric muscle. Clearing out the anterior neck preparation while carefully protecting the superior thyroid artery, hypoglossal nerve and the slender facial vein. Complete the neck dissection after exposing the accessory nerve in the case of conspicuous nodes in the jugular-facial angle, exposing the cervical plexus roots, the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve corresponding to the opposite side on the left. Resection up to level V b. Careful check for lymphatic leakage. Dry conditions here. Careful hemostasis. Turn to tumor resection. Detachment of the infrahyoid musculature. Skeletonization of the larynx on the right side. Careful and complete release of the piriform sinus. On the left side, the attempt to detach the thyroid cartilage horn already reveals an adhesion or direct adherence to the tumor; if partially opened here, the suture is marked in the sense of a suture closure for later marking and covering of the margins. Skeletonize the cricoid cartilage and trachea while exposing and detaching the thyroid gland. Now enter enorally in the area of the vallecula on the right side, widen along the aryepiglottic fold and proceed in a mucosa-sparing manner. After widening the pharyngotomy, a good overview is now obtained. As described above, the tumor infiltrates caudal to the tonsil. Incision with a safety margin. Somewhat vulnerable conditions in the area of the glossotonsillar groove, otherwise macroscopically all around in sano incision of the tumor. Good control of the deep infiltration. Supply and removal of the lingual artery on the left side. Largely sparing of the postcricoid mucosa and removal of the tumor macroscopically in sano. The marginal specimen is now largely removed from the specimen. The site already described in the area of the thyroid cartilage horn on the left or the pharyngeal side wall here is additionally covered in the area of the soft tissue. In addition, in situ marginal sampling of the described vulnerable area completely in the base of the tongue up to the tonsil lobe. In the frozen section diagnostics, all tumor samples are now diagnosed as dysplasia and carcinoma-free, therefore an R0 situation can be assumed here. Careful hemostasis. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Defect reconstruction. Inspection of the defect. There is a hypopharyngeal defect starting at the soft palate up to the esophageal entrance. More than half of the pharyngeal mucosa is missing on the soft palate and in the upper part of the hypopharynx. Primary suturing is not possible in this area. A quarter to a third is missing in the distal area at the entrance to the esophagus. Primary suturing is still acceptable here. Decision to reconstruct the defect with an anterolateral transfemoral graft from the right. Intraoperative demo again to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Then turn to the thigh. First Doppler the perforating vessels. Five good perforator vessels can be identified, three of which can be claimed as main perforators. Mark the graft 12 x 7 cm so that the doubled perforator vessels are centrally located in the area of the graft. Incise the upper edge. Expose the fascia and the rectus femoris muscle. Exposure of the intermedius muscle and the sulcus. Exposing the descending ramus, the circumflex femoral artery and locating the outlets of the perforating vessels. This was successful without any problems. The perforating vessels are dissected from the pedicle to the periphery in the direction of the muscle and skin. Cut around the entire graft and remove the distal end of the stalk. Then develop the graft while protecting the perforator vessels. Some muscle is left around the perforator vessels on the posterior surface. Deposit the pedicle relatively far proximally. A good artery and two veins can be elevated. The nerve is severed. Bipolar coagulation. Insertion of a Redon drain and direct wound closure in the area of the thigh. Now turn to the pharyngeal defect. First conditioning of blood vessels. The vascular situation is very poor. There is only a stump of the superior thyroid on both sides. There is virtually nothing left of the venous connecting vessels except for an external jugular vein and the internal jugular vein. The stump of the superior thyroid on the left side is conditioned as well as the external and internal jugular veins. First fitting of the transplant. Sutures are placed in the area of the oropharynx and hypopharynx on the left side. Suturing in the graft. This is very difficult as the patient cannot recline the head and the graft has to be inserted very far cranially on the soft palate and at the base of the tongue. Finally, complete pharyngeal closure by the graft and primary pharyngeal suture in the distal area. Then conditioning of the flap vessels and start with the anastomosis of the artery. This is successful without any problems. Then anastomosis of the external jugular vein with a graft vein. This is very difficult due to a large difference in caliber. This difference in caliber can only be partially compensated for by cutting the graft vein at an angle. Another vein must be placed end-to-side on the left internal jugular vein. This is also not easy. In the end, very good pedicle pulsation and extremely good reflux in the veins. At the end, the tracheostoma is sutured. The apron flap is folded back. Redon drains inserted beforehand. Graft control from transorally. Good graft perfusion here. The patient goes to the intensive care unit ventilated. Please continue 3 x 3 g Unacid for 24 hours postoperatively as well as daily flap checks according to the usual schedule.

Inspection of the trachea with the O° scope and the endolarynx. No abnormal findings here, the trachea appears clear up to the bifurcation. Problem-free orotracheal intubation by the surgeon. Inspection of the endolarynx with the Kleinsasser tube. Here, the pocket folds on both sides are unremarkable, as are the arytenoids on both sides. Postcricoid region without irritation, inconspicuous mucosa. The piriform sinus can be freely unfolded on both sides, no evidence of tumor growth, smooth mucosa. The vocal folds show smooth, inconspicuous mucosa on both sides. Now inspection of the epiglottis and the vallecula, here also unremarkable findings. The base of the tongue is unremarkable on inspection and palpation. Inspection of the oral cavity. Inconspicuous vestibulum oris, tongue also inconspicuous on inspection and palpation. Left glossotonsillar groove unremarkable. Soft palpation of the floor of the mouth. Now inspection of the oropharynx. Left tonsil region unremarkable, posterior pharyngeal wall smooth. Inspection of the right anterior palatal arch reveals an approx. 1.5 cm large, whitish deposit, coarse, palpable. The glossotonsillar groove does not appear to be involved in the process on palpation. Tonsil slightly coarse on the right, but not primarily tumor-suspect. Inspection of the nasopharynx using 70° optics, showing inconspicuous mucosal conditions. All findings are reproduced and confirmed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Performing the esophagogastroscopy: Easy insertion of the flexible endoscope into the esophagus and visualization of the esophagus into the stomach, where a regular folded relief can be seen. After distension of the stomach, more detailed inspection of the mucosa. This appears atrophic overall. No evidence of ulcer or tumor growth. After aspiration of the insufflated air, careful reflection and examination of the esophageal mucosa. A slightly hypertrophic mucosa was found in the area of the esophagogastric junction, otherwise the mucosal conditions in the rest of the esophagus were unremarkable. Decision by <CLINICIAN_NAME> to perform an excisional biopsy of the suspected tumor lesion as a right-sided tonsillectomy. Tumor resection through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Insertion of the oral spatula. The tumor in the area of the anterior palatal arch on the right is carefully excised with a safety margin of 0.5 cm. The anterior palatal arch falls, resection up to the alveolar ridge, the periosteum remains covered by soft tissue. In addition, a small part of the base of the tongue is removed. The posterior palatal arch remains completely intact. The excision also includes careful removal of the tonsil. Bipolar coagulation of the lower tonsil pole and finally separation of the complete preparation. This is sent to histology marked with a thread. Macroscopically, the tumor appears to be removed from the healthy tissue. An additional lateral margin sample is taken in the area of the alveolar ridge. Hemostasis with H202 swab and bipolar coagulation. Recheck of the surgical site, no source of bleeding visible. Conclusion: cT1 cN0 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right.

After appropriate preparation, oropharyngoscopy is performed once again: the ulcerated tumor can be seen here, which appears to be limited to the tonsil but extends laterally on palpation. Insertion of the PEG tube After entering the stomach and postoperative diaphanoscopy, the tube is inserted under visualization. This is done without any problems. Application of a wound dressing. Infiltration with local anesthetic in the neck area. Performing the tracheostomy: To do this, sharply cut through the skin and subcutaneous fatty tissue. Push apart the prelaryngeal muscles, undermine the isthmus of the thyroid gland and expose the pretracheal lamina. Then opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp and easy reintubation of the patient. Placement of the lower stoma sutures for mucocutaneous anastomosis. Then sterile washing and draping of the neck, arm and right thigh. Start with the neck dissection on the right side. Here, while protecting all non-lymphatic structures, regions I to V are evacuated after exposure and skeletonization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Neurolysis of the accessorius and hypoglossal nerves and re-embedding of the nerves. The superior thyroid, lingual and facial arteries are then exposed at their exit from the external carotid artery, thus shifting the external carotid artery laterally until the tumor can be safely bypassed. The lingual artery on the right side cannot be preserved as it runs through the middle of the tumor, so it is removed. The hypoglossal nerve is completely skeletonized and can be preserved until the end. On palpation, the tumor extends to just above the hyoid bone. The pharynx is then opened caudal to the tumor and cranial to the hyoid bone in the area of the lateral hypopharyngeal wall. The tumor is then successively developed completely from the transcervical side under visual control and resected with an appropriate safety margin. Histology is then taken from the mucosal margins. These are all found to be tumor-free on frozen section histology. Subsequent measurement of the defect with a 7 x 5.5 cm defect. Transition to neck dissection of the left side. This is performed in the same way as on the right side after visualization and skeletonization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, including displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the accessory nerve and hypoglossus. Here too, all non-lymphatic structures are spared and regions II to V are removed. Closure of the left side of the neck using multi-layered sutures after insertion of a Redon suction drain. Application of a pressure dressing. Elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap boundaries (7 x 5.5 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the pronator quadratus and flexor pollicis longus muscles with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vascular clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Covering of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. After appropriate development of the radial lobe graft, it is inserted transcervically into the defect. The radialis flap is then sutured transorally into the right oropharynx. The last caudal sutures in the area of the base of the tongue and the lateral hypopharyngeal wall are performed transcervically, resulting in complete tension-free closure of the defect. Check again transorally. The two anastomoses are then performed. First, the arterial anastomosis is performed after appropriate preliminary preparation of the superior thyroid artery. The large caliber vein, which accommodates the superficial as well as the deep drainage area of the flap, is attached to the internal jugular vein in an end-to-side anastomosis. No bleeding visible on final check with vital graft. Insertion of a Redon suction drain as well as an Easy-Flow drain. Multi-layer wound closure on the right cervical side. Application of a pressure dressing. Control of the flap transorally, whereby the graft is absolutely vital. Re-intubation of the patient onto an 8-gauge Rügheimer cannula, which is fixed to the skin. Application of a neck bandage. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Conclusion: Transcervical resection of a tonsillar carcinoma on the right side with selective neck dissection on both sides. Defect coverage via a microvascularly anastomosed radial artery flap graft from the left forearm. The arterial anastomosis is made via the superior thyroid artery. The venous anastomosis forms an end-to-side anastomosis to the internal jugular vein. Defect coverage on the left forearm via a split-thickness skin graft from the right thigh.

Intraoperative cT2 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. The immediate preoperative ultrasound showed a cN1 neck status.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, the patient is positioned. First, the tumor is inspected enorally. An exophytic tumor is seen in the area of the right tonsil with macroscopically clearly carcinomatous extensions towards the soft palate to the right parauvular region. Partly island-like tumor growth. The tumor extends towards the buccal and alveolar ridge, does not reach the maxilla. No deep infiltration of the soft tissues of the cheek, superficial growth also in the area of the alveolar ridge. The dorsal floor of the mouth is infiltrated via the glossotonsillar groove and the posterior floor of the mouth, also submucosal tumor growth towards the edge of the tongue. The right edge of the tongue is infiltrated over approximately half the length, approximately Ľ deep infiltration. Tumor growth to just before the posterior palatal arch. The posterior pharyngeal wall is free, as is the caudal pharyngeal side wall towards the entrance to the piriform sinus. Overall, the extent is clearly cT3. PEG insertion is performed first. This is done with the gastroscope. Careful endoscopy into the stomach. With excellent diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. The patient is then prepared for definitive tumor resection. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. First start with transoral resection. The tumor is completely marked and cut around with a safety margin of approx. 1 cm in the area of the oral cavity and 1.5 cm in the area of the tongue. All suspicious mucosal changes localized in the marginal area are removed. This results in a subtotal resection of the soft palate. Removal towards the upper jaw and soft cheek parts. Exposure of the pterygoid muscles. Clearly safe and free tissue conditions in depth. Incision of the alveolar mucosa. This is done sharply down to the bone. Detachment of the mucosa with removal of the periosteum. Resection of the posterior floor of the mouth. Resection of the right edge of the tongue. Resection up to the base of the tongue. Total approx. Ľ resection of the tongue. Part of the submandibular gland is removed transorally in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth to maintain a safety margin. The lingual nerve must also be resected during tumor resection. With macroscopic in sano resection of the tumor, marginal specimens are taken from the specimen that completely depict the primary tumor. These are completely resected as tumor-free in the frozen section diagnosis, therefore an overall R0 situation can be assumed here. The graft is now measured. The neck dissections are then carried out. The neck dissection of the right side and the tracheotomy were performed in parallel with the graft elevation from the left forearm. The neck dissection of the left side is performed first. To do this, make a curved skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid and digastric muscles. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Free dissection of the internal jugular vein with exposure and preservation of the facial vein. Dissection of the anterior neck preparation with careful preservation of the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerves. Subsequent release of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. No caudal evidence of lymphatic leakage. Clinically no highly suspicious masses on the left side. After careful wound inspection, after wound irrigation, with dry wound conditions and insertion of a 10 Redon drainage, careful, two-layer wound closure. Subsequent repositioning for neck dissection on the opposite side. The procedure is basically the same here. Skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid and digastric muscles. Clearing out the anterior neck preparation while carefully protecting the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. A facial vein is not developed here. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Complete dissection of the internal jugular vein. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Evacuation of level V while protecting the cervical plexus branches. Level II revealed a lymph node measuring approx. 2 x 2 cm, round and therefore suspicious, otherwise subcapsular release of the submandibular gland. Resection of the remaining gland after, as described above, resection already by transoral resection. Careful release of level I b, here several lymph nodes measuring up to 1 ˝ cm. Now resection of the digastric muscle. Overall, a relatively wide shaft is now created enorally, approx. 3 transverse fingers wide. Careful wound irrigation and wound inspection. First turn to the plastic tracheotomy. To do this, make a skin incision at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Cut through the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring. First creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap, this is relatively vulnerable, therefore a tracheal window is created. The trachea is then sutured in the usual manner using the back-stitch technique. Subsequently, intubation is first changed to a Woodbridge tube and later to a size 8 low cuff cannula. The radialis graft is then lifted from the left forearm. After the graft has already been measured enorally with a special soft palate and tongue edge configuration, a graft measuring up to 10 x 10 cm is marked. Positioning over the radial artery while protecting the retinaculum. Application of the tourniquet. Radial incision of the graft, taking the cephalic vein with it. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the superficial radial nerve ramus and preservation of the complete nerve in its course. Ulnar visualization of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. Identification of the distal vascular pedicle. Removal of the vascular pedicle after ligation. Strictly subfascial release with clipping of distal pedicle branches. Proximal dissection. Exposure of the ulnar artery. Exposure of the radial vein and artery. Exposure of the common interosseous artery. It is now apparent that the cephalic vein does not have a pronounced connection to the deep venous system, therefore several strong accompanying veins are elevated in relation to the graft. A total of 4 graft veins were elevated. After reopening the tourniquet, regular hand perfusion and excellent graft perfusion. Careful hemostasis of the graft and forearm. Subsequent removal of the vital graft after ligation of the feeding and draining vessels. The graft is then carefully implanted transorally. Overall good fit and intact conditions on all sides. Overall, somewhat laborious insertion conditions due to the size of the defect. In conclusion, however, a good result. Transcervical pedicle positioning. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery. There is also a superior thyroid vein and the strong external jugular vein. After conditioning the flap vessels, perform the arterial anastomosis with Ethilon 8-0. Subsequently, create tight relationships. Select 2 strong, returning venous vessels. Anastomosis of a vein to the stump of the superior thyroid vein. Also anastomosis to the external jugular vein. Subsequent regular graft perfusion. Regular flow from the vessels with a positive smear test, so that a 10 Redon drain is inserted on the right cervical side if the graft perfusion is regular. Subsequent careful, two-layer wound closure. Now to the treatment of the left forearm. First, careful, two-layer wound closure after final wound inspection. Then insertion of the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the right groin. Careful trimming of the full-thickness skin. Final good fit. Subsequent application of a hydrogel and Mepilex dressing and application of the stretcher splint functional position. Now for full-thickness skin harvesting from the right groin. Trimming of a piece of full-thickness skin measuring approx. 14 x 10 cm. Strict cutaneous lifting. Final thinning of the graft. Subsequent extensive subcutaneous mobilization down to the abdominal fascia and the fascia lata. Careful hemostasis. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure under very low tension conditions. Final inspection and completion of the procedure with a vital graft, without any indication of complications. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT3 cN1 G2 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Defect reconstruction using a microvascular anastomosed radialis graft. Postoperatively, please carry out an X-ray gruel swallow on the 8th to 9th postoperative day, after which a diet can be set up depending on swallowing function.","Transoral tumor resection, Neck dissection, PEG placement, Free flap coverage (Radial), Tracheotomy

Therefore indication for the above mentioned surgery. First attempt at PEG insertion: Pre-mirroring of the esophagoscope into the stomach. Even after several attempts, diaphanoscopy could not be achieved, so that the PEG placement seemed too risky. A feeding tube is therefore inserted. Tracheostoma placement: The thyroid isthmus is exposed via the caudal end of the zigzag incision. This is clamped off and supplied using puncture ligatures. Enter the inter-cartilaginous space between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a wide-stemmed Björk flap. Now repositioning for tracheostomy and fronto-lateral partial laryngeal resection: injection of a total of 20 ml xylocaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck and prelaryngeally. Prelaryngeal zigzag incision leading into the tracheostomy. Expose the infrahyoid muscles. Push off the soft tissue. Splitting of the infrahyoid musculature.

Thyrofissure with the wheel saw, sawing out a triangle that begins just below the incision. This is followed by dissection of the perichondrium from the remaining thyroid cartilage on both sides. No tumor infiltrates as already described in the CT are visible here either. Entering the larynx cranially. Overview of the tumor. Overview also relatively difficult via direct view, so that the tumor is finally transected medially. The tumor can now also be seen with a good overview of its subglottic extension. The tumor is initially removed on the left with a safety margin of several mm on all sides, whereby the resection is also carried out slightly subglottically. Resection also includes 2/3 of the left vocal fold including the ventriculus laryngeus and parts of the pocket fold. On the right, the tumor was also macroscopically resected with a safety margin of several mm on all sides. Here, a clear part of the subglottic area was resected. The resection extends to the arytenoid cartilage, which is partially resected. The cranial pocket fold is also resected. Caudally, the upper edge of the cricoid cartilage is exposed. Both specimens are marked with sutures and sent for frozen section. Margin samples from the arytenoid region, from the interary region to the left and from the lateral and cranial sides are also sent in. Preparation on the left completely healthy. On the right, subglottic to cranial and in the arytenoid region not in healthy tissue. Also marginal specimen in the interary region with CIS and marginal specimen cranial with CIS, also marginal specimen in the arytenoid region with CIS. Therefore, a 5-6 mm wide strip is resected again subglottically, covering the entire mucosa from the left paramedian to the posterior wall. This is thread-marked to the frozen section. No more infiltrates in the frozen section. A resection is also taken from the cranial area with a subsequent marginal sample. No more infiltrates in the frozen section. A resection is taken from the interary area as well as a further marginal sample, which extends to the left arytenoid cartilage. Here, mild to moderate dysplasia, but no CIS. Another extensive marginal sample is sent in from the ary area, which again includes parts of the arytenoid cartilage and surrounding soft tissue. Still carcinoma in situ infiltrates here. Another marginal sample is therefore sent in. This includes all cartilage and soft tissue parts up to the upper edge of the cricoid cartilage up to the mucosa of the postcricoid region, which, however, remains intact. The remaining marginal sample is sent for final diagnosis. If this marginal sample is positive, a laryngectomy is probably unavoidable for oncological reasons. Mucosa from the postcricoid region is sutured to the cricoid cartilage with two 3.0 Vicryl sutures to improve epithelialization. Subsequently, remnants of the pocket ligament are fixed to the left side of the thyroid cartilage via a drill hole. The thyroid cartilage is readapted cranially via drill holes. Perichondrium with attached soft tissue is successively adapted with Vicryl 4.0 single button sutures until complete soft tissue closure over the cartilage is achieved. The infrahyoid musculature is then sutured over the perichondrium. The wound is closed in layers with epithelialization of the previously inserted tracheostoma. A 9 mm tracheostomy tube is then inserted. Neck dissection on both sides: Beginning with the right side: Curved incision in front of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissection of the fat lymph node package. Exposure of V. jugularis interna, exposure of A. carotis communis, A. carotis interna, A. carotis externa and A. thyroidea superior. Visualization of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. Successive development of the anterior neck preparation with visualization and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve and superior thyroid artery. Subsequent development of the dorsal neck preparation with preservation of the branches of the cervical plexus. In level 2, cranial lymph nodes clearly suspected of malignancy. Neck dissection is then performed on the left side: in principle, this is performed in the same way as on the right side. The structures mentioned are also visualized. Levels 2-4 are evacuated. Irrigation of the entire wound area on both sides and careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain in each case. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Intraoperatively started antibiotic treatment with clindamycin should be continued for at least 1 week with 4 x 300 mg/die. Wait for final histology. If residual histology from the right arytenoid region is tumor-free, radiation therapy should be discussed postoperatively in the residual laryngeal region. In the case of extensive resection in the arytenoid region, dysfunction of the swallowing function and protracted swallowing rehabilitation are to be expected, so this should be initiated as early as possible. In addition, control MLE should be performed in approx. 3 months. If histology in the arytenoid region continues to show carcinoma, a residual laryngectomy cannot be avoided for oncological reasons. The patient should then undergo speech rehabilitation.","Partial laryngeal resection (Leroux-Robert), Neck dissection

Histological confirmation of a papillary carcinoma in situ as part of a panendoscopy and sampling on <2016> in domo. There is now an indication for resection. In addition, at the beginning of the operation, an approx. 1 cm large, flat, whitish thickened mass was noticed on the underside of the tongue on the front left, which was also removed. The indication for the above-mentioned procedure is therefore given.","First bring the patient into the operating room and actively identify the patient. Then carry out the team time-out. Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. The surgeon now positions the patient. Inspection and palpation of the oral cavity and tongue. As described above, there is a 1 cm large mass on the underside of the tongue on the left anterior side. Furthermore, the papillomatous mass on the glossotonsillar fold on the right side measuring approx. 2 x 1 cm. Directly anterior to this, clearly hyperkeratotic, leukoplakically altered underside of the tongue and tongue surface in the posterior third of the tongue reaching up to the gingiva, which appears suspicious and is directly related to the papillomatous mass. Therefore, excision of the papillomatous mass with the leukoplakic mucosal change in toto. Marking using bipolar. Subsequent excision in toto using a monopolar needle. Several marginal samples are taken (surface of the tongue, undersurface of the tongue, posteriorly and at the base of the wound). Excision of the mass on the anterior underside of the tongue and, after bipolar hemostasis, suturing in this area. After one hour, the frozen section is made: Here, high-grade dysplasia is seen focally in the posterior margin. Therefore, a large incision (2 x 1 cm) is made here and then a marginal sample is sent for final histology. The result is an approx. 5 x 3 cm wound area on the right posterior third of the tongue, soft palate, tonsil lobe and gingiva. Only anterior adaptation of the wound edges using individual Vicryl 3.0 SH sutures. Subsequent bipolar hemostasis and, under dry conditions, completion of the operation without complications.

Overall, after completion of the diagnostics, cT2 cN2b cM tongue margin carcinoma on the right in the area of the underside of the tongue or the anterior floor of the mouth on the right. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was recommended.","First inspection of the primary tumor region after transnasal intubation and preparation by the anesthesia colleagues. Positioning of the patient. The ulcerated tumor described above is seen in the area of the underside of the tongue and the anterior floor of the mouth on the right side with a largely endophytic tumor component and complete fixation of the underside of the tongue on the right side corresponding to the preoperative clinic. No infiltration of the alveolar ridge. No infiltration of the left-sided floor of the mouth. The tumor is now cut around with a safety margin of a good 1 cm in the area of the anterior alveolar ridge. Here, the mucosa is pushed away from the bone, otherwise wide in sano resection in the area of the tongue, growth towards the outer muscles of the floor of the mouth, but these are not infiltrated. Exposure of the muscles of the floor of the mouth, no direct contact with the metastasis in level I on the right side. Macroscopic and palpatory in sano resection of the tumor, which is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics and is resected in sano on the specimen. Scarce area basally towards the tip of the tongue with otherwise clearly in sano resection. For this reason, a resection is performed here to extend the safety margin, which is then used for definitive histology so that a safe in sano resection is finally available. Measurement of the defect. Turn first to the neck dissection and tracheotomy. Start with the right side. Submandibular incision. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation and dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland and exposure of the digastric muscle. This reveals a moderately displaceable, high-suspecting mass located in front of the submandibular gland, which lies against the mandible but still shows some displacement here. Exposure and dissection of the facial vein, which drains into the anterior jugular vein and the internal jugular vein. Excision of the submandibular gland, including level Ib, here some small but coarse and therefore conspicuous nodules. For resection of the metastasis, incision on the mandible on the periosteum. Push off the periosteum. However, the metastasis can be detached here. Deposition of the anterior venter of the digastric muscle if there is clear infiltration. Also circumscribed infiltration of the anterior floor of the mouth. Therefore clear perinodal spread here. En bloc entrainment, here from level Ia. Hypoglossal nerve, lingual nerve, lingual artery and facial artery can be preserved. Now free preparation of the internal jugular vein after exposure of the accessorius nerve. Dissection of the accessorius triangle and dissection of level V while carefully preserving the cervical plexus branches and exposing the common carotid artery and vagus nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein reveals a highly visible mass on the common carotid artery extending anteriorly into the jugulofacial angle. Careful dissection of the vein. There is a circumscribed infiltration of the mouth of the facial vein. This is therefore removed. The vessel to the anterior jugular vein is also removed. Complete and expose the internal jugular vein while maintaining cranial continuity and completing the neck dissection. The tunnel is created enorally. Create a tunnel measuring approx. 3 QF for stem positioning. Approach the neck dissection on the left side. Here also submandibular incision, cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue, exposing and cutting through the platysma. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and preservation of the external jugular vein and on the opposite side. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland, taking the capsule with it. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Free preparation and preservation of the facial vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful exposure and protection of the cervical artery of the superior thyroid and the hypoglossal nerve and preservation of the facial nerve draining into the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Complete according to level V, exploration of the sonographically described mass in level Vb. An oval, but rough and therefore suspicious mass measuring approx. 1 cm is actually found here. This is extirpated and level Vb is completed. Careful treatment of some leaking lymphatic fluid. Finally, absolutely dry conditions. Even after multiple inspections, the wound is finally irrigated, followed by insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. The tracheotomy is then performed in the case of post-thyroidectomy. Horizontal incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring, forming a horizontal visor tracheotomy. Subsequent suturing of the mucocutaneous anastomosis, later problem-free reintubation on a low cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. The defect is then measured. After tumor resection, this resulted in resection of the anterior third or anterior half of the right-sided tongue and resection of the anterior floor of the mouth. Due to the slender proportions, the decision was made to elevate and cover the defect with an anterolateral transfemoral graft. After doppler sonographic identification of the main perforator and marking of the anatomical landmarks, doppler sonographic identification of 2 secondary perforators, marking of the graft measuring a total of 6 x 8 cm with a special mouth floor configuration. Subsequent medial incision, cutting of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and securing of the rectus femoris muscle. Subcutaneous release while protecting the vascularized intermuscular septum. Performing a release incision after identifying the pedicle vessels. An oblique branch running steeply caudally and a further upper oblique branch can be seen. Identification of the main perforator with musculocutaneous course. Dissection of the main perforator. Initially, it can be seen that one of the secondary perforators extends from the main perforator; later, during dissection, the second secondary perforator can also be seen extending from the main perforator. After tracing the perforator, it can be seen to extend from the oblique upper vessel, leaving a small muscle cuff at the outlet of the perforator. Complete cutting of the graft after preparation of the vascular pedicle. Conditioning of the pedicle vessels and removal of the vital graft. Careful hemostasis in the area of the leg. Subsequent insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure with resection of excess skin. The graft is then incorporated transorally. This succeeds well and with sufficient volume filling in the area of the tip of the tongue and the missing lateral tongue. Positioning of the pedicle vessels, conditioning of the superior thyroid artery. Performing the arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. Subsequent conditioning of the graft vein. Performing a venous anastomosis with the Coupler system on the superior thyroid vein in the correct pedicle position and graft perfusion. Subsequently, regular graft perfusion and positive spreading phenomenon and regular pedicle pulsation, so that subsequent careful wound closure on the right cervical side, subsequent termination of the procedure without any indication of complications. Note: Due to the patient's documented refusal of a PEG tube, a nasogastric feeding tube was inserted. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with clindamycin, which should be continued for 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT2 oral floor carcinoma on the right side with a strikingly aggressive and discontinuous metastatic pattern. Intraoperative cN2c neck status possible, therefore prompt adjuvant therapy should be initiated here.

Entry with the laryngoscope and charging of the piriform sinus. Entering with the flexible gastroesophagoscope and advancing into the stomach. Air insufflation into the stomach and elevation of the upper body by approx. 30 %. Perform positive diaphanoscopy. PEG placement in the usual manner using the suture pull-through method without complications. Now repositioning of the patient. Injection of Suprarenin. Sterile wiping and draping. Horizontal skin incision over 2 cm just below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection of the infralaryngeal muscles. Split the infralaryngeal muscles in the midline and dissect down to the cricoid cartilage. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus and sharp transection of the isthmus after bipolar coagulation. Identification of the anterior tracheal wall. Creation of a visor tracheotomy in the 2nd to 3rd intratracheal fissure. Insertion of an 8-gauge cannula after epithelialization of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Then tumor resection transorally by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: insertion of mouth retractor. Exposure of the tumor. The tumor is incised on all sides at a distance of at least 1.5 cm. This results in an almost complete hemiglossectomy. The sublingual gland is resected, as are larger parts of the floor of the mouth and larger parts of the base of the tongue. The preparation is sent in toto and thread-marked for a frozen section. Here all margins are healthy. Thus R0 resection. Subsequent neck dissection. The undersigned first performs the neck dissection on the left side after sterile washing and infiltration with local anesthetic containing adrenaline. This is followed by a skin incision along the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection of the platysma flap and fixation in the usual manner. Subsequent skeletonization of the vascular nerve sheath. Identification and protection of the hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. Evacuation of regions II to IV. There is no caliber or other type of facial vein. Subsequent evacuation of region I after submandibulectomy. This already creates a defect in the enoral direction, where the flap will be inserted later. Dissection of the digastric muscle at its tendon. Subsequent skeletonization of the superior thyroid artery, which will later be used for anastomosis. Then transition to the operation on the right side. In principle, the same procedure is used here. There are no clinically manifest lymph node metastases on either side. Elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (8 x 6 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris.

During the initial operation, a suspicious finding was found in the area of the left upper tonsil pole. Pathohistologically, however, there was no evidence of a primary tumor. Therefore, initially suspected CUP syndrome and therefore further appropriate CUP diagnostics. The subsequent PET-CT showed no evidence of further metastases in addition to the metastatic conglomerate on the left side. Only a slight increase in the area of the left tonsil. There is now an indication for a left tonsillectomy and frozen section diagnostics. In addition, a modified radical neck dissection on the left side is indicated. Due to the sonomorphologic cN2b neck status and the unremarkable cervical PET findings on the right, a neck dissection on the right side does not appear to be indicated. The patient consented to the planned procedure.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carry out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Induction of anesthesia and intubation of the patient. Start of tonsillectomy. Insertion of the McIvor oral spatula while protecting the teeth, lips and tongue. Grasping the tonsil and medializing it. Mucosal incision in the area of the fold at the anterior palatal arch. Exposure of the tonsil capsule. Successive dissection along the muscles of the anterior and posterior palatal arch. Exposure of the lower tonsil pole. Bipolar coagulation of the pole vessels. Separation of the tonsil at the lower left pole. This is sent in for frozen section diagnostics. Perform a mucosoplasty. In the meantime, reposition the patient for neck dissection on the left side. Superficial skin disinfection. Infiltration anesthesia. Ablation of the surgical site and sterile draping. Marking of the planned incision from the mastoid over the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, curving caudally. Cut sharply through the cutis and subcutis as well as the platysma. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle as the caudal border. Exposure, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the accessorius nerve and the posterior digastric nerve as the cranial border. Turning to the cervical vascular sheath and exposure of the internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery. Successive detachment of the pronounced metastatic conglomerate from the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A clear displacement layer is visible here, so that intraoperatively no infiltration of the muscle must be assumed. In region II, the jugular vein is adjacent to the metastatic conglomerate. After laborious blunt dissection, however, it can be seen that a displacement layer is also present here. The vein therefore does not appear to be infiltrated by tumor even in the cranial sections. Therefore, successive sharp and blunt dissection and detachment of the metastatic conglomerate from the internal jugular vein. Subsequent successive development of the neck preparation from level IIb via level IIa, III and IV. Palpation reveals further metastases in the deep level IV as well as in level V. Level IV and V are therefore also cleared. A prominent thoracic duct can also be seen in deep level IV. This is grasped and ligated several times. Subsequent hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. There is no chyle flow here. Then develop the medial neck preparation. The superior thyroid artery must be ligated in advance, as there is a strong outflow in the direction of the tumor conglomerate. Finally, palpatory exploration of the wound cavity. There is no evidence of further metastatic nodes. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure with Vicryl 4.0 and Ethilon 5.0. Application of a pressure bandage. In the meantime, a rapid incision was made by telephone, stating that a tonsil carcinoma R0 was resected on the left side as part of the tumor tonsillectomy. A resection is therefore necessary. Final inspection of the tonsil lobe. If the wound bed is dry, the operation is completed without complications. Final consultation with the anesthetist.","Tonsillectomy, Neck dissection

Findings on CT correlated. Now entering with the Kleinsasser tube size B and adjusting the tumor. Tumor is now resected successively with a safety margin of between 0.5 and just under 1 cm. Laterally, the resection extends to the cartilage, anteriorly also dorsally to the arytenoid cartilage, which is resected slightly in the interlaryngeal area. Caudally, the resection extends to the cricoid cartilage. The tumor is removed and resected microscopically with a safety margin. The tumor is suture-marked. Due to the fact that the anterior and posterior margins are somewhat narrower, a glottic, subglottic and supraglottic margin sample is taken from the area of the anterior commissure and the adjacent soft tissue. Also marginal sample dorsally in the area of the arytenoid cartilage and the arytenoid fold transition. In the frozen section, all samples are tumor-free or the edges of the tumor are tumor-free. So R0 situation. Hemostasis follows. In the anterior region, the transverse artery in the area of the conus elasticus had to be bipolized during the resection; this will be repeated. In the dorsal area, the inferior laryngeal artery was treated with clips. No more bleeding here. Most careful hemostasis. No evidence of bleeding on final inspection. Exposure of the cartilage in the area of the anterior commissure and on the left in the entire area. Patient therefore received Sobelin 600 mg i.v. Please continue antibiotics for one week.

The above-mentioned surgery was therefore indicated.,"Introductory consultation with the anesthesiologist. After reclination of the head, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The described tumor is seen, which starts next to the uvula on the left, extends over the palatal arch and the tonsillar lobe to the base of the tongue. The tumor grows in the area of the cranial oropharyngeal side wall ulcerating in depth. Therefore, flap coverage is also indicated according to the CT findings. PEG placement is performed first: insertion of the flexible esophagoscope. Push through into the stomach. After creating the diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube in a typical manner without complications. Fixation of the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Then repositioning of the patient. Skin disinfection, sterile draping of all relevant surgical areas. Start with the neck dissection on the left: Skin incision curved in a typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure and preservation of the common carotid artery, internal/external carotid artery, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Also visualization of the branches of the cervical plexus. Development of the posterior neck preparation and later also the anterior neck preparation. This results in the removal of levels II-V. All branches of the cervical plexus were exposed and preserved. Neck dissection on the right: skin incision as on the opposite side. Exposure of all structures as on the opposite side. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. This results in a level II-IV neck dissection and smaller parts of V. All structures are exposed and preserved as on the opposite side. Tracheostoma creation: Small Kocher's cross-section. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature. Spreading of these. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Undercutting, clamping, severing and ligation using puncture ligatures. Exposure of the trachea. Preparation of a small wide-pedicled Björk flap. Epithelization of the same in a typical manner. Insertion of a laryngectomy tube. Tumor resection from the transoral and trancervical side, initially from the left side of the neck dissection. Dissection of the external carotid artery, internal carotid artery, vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve, accessorius nerve and internal jugular vein as well as the superior ganglion from the pharyngeal wall. Nerve vessels are dissected from the pharyngeal tube up to the base of the skull. No tumor infiltrates visible here. The submandibular gland is also extirpated. The lingual nerve is exposed and preserved. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the same. The digastric muscle is also resected. All important vessels and nerve structures are then looped using Vesselloops and pulled to the side. Transorally, the tumor is incised on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm. This results in the removal of the entire pharyngeal wall including the attached soft tissue up to the level of the piriform sinus entrance. Resection extends inwards to the base of the tongue. Approximately 20% of this is resected. The posterior pharyngeal wall is partially resected. The tumor specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section diagnostics. Similarly, marginal samples are taken from the palatal arch, from the pharyngeal wall medially, from the transition from the posterior palatal arch to the tonsil, from the lateral in the form of the uvula and a soft tissue marginal sample from the cranial-basal side. In the frozen section preparation, taking into account the marginal samples in healthy tissue. Unclear situation at the transition from palatal arch to medial pharyngeal wall. Therefore, another cranial-medial margin sample was taken from the pharyngeal wall at the junction of the tonsillar lobe and palatal arch. No tumor infiltrates in the frozen section here either. Thus a definitive R0 situation. The result is a defect on the palatal arch extending beyond the uvula, posterior pharyngeal wall, lateral pharyngeal wall up to the entrance of the piriform sinus and the base of the tongue and vallecula up to the epiglottis. A radial lobe is measured in terms of length, width and three-dimensional shape. The radial lobe is then elevated from the left forearm: Mark the radialis flap, which reaches 13 cm in length and 8 cm in maximum width. First lift the flap from the ulnar side. Then extend the incision into the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the vascular pedicle, exposure of the superficial vascular system. Then lift the flap from the radial side. Deposition of the flap distally and ligation of the radial artery cranially and caudally using 4.0 Prolene sutures. The flap is then lifted subfascially along its pedicle, including the superficial venous system. Outgoing vessels are bipolized or treated with clips, larger ones are ligated. Cranial view of the connection between the superficial and deep venous system. There is only a rudimentary venous outflow via the radial vein, which is divided into smaller vessels. These are clipped. The interosseous artery is very small and is clipped. The flap is removed at the brachial artery and two larger branches from the cephalic vein. The veins are ligated. The artery is supplied with a 6.0 Vascufil suture. Saturation during the elevation is always 100%, clinically no abnormalities. The flap is flushed with heparin. Subsequent insertion of the flap: insertion into the defect. Successive incorporation of the flap into the defect using 3.0 Vicryl single-button sutures, which is successful without tension. Flap suturing partially with sutures in place. Subsequent arterial anastomosis. The superior thyroid artery is selected. After conditioning the vessels, suture with 8.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. Conditioning of the two outlets of the cephalic vein. One outlet is anastomosed with an outlet from the facial vein. Anastomosis is performed after conditioning the vessels with a 2.5 mm coupler. The other outlet is then anastomosed with an outlet from the V. thyroidea media after conditioning the vessel ends using a 2.5 mm coupler. Again, after opening the vessels, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. This is followed by extensive irrigation of the neck wounds on both sides and careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain on both sides. Pressure dressing on both sides. Covering the forearm defect on the left: For this purpose, a 0.7-0.8 mm thick split-thickness skin graft is obtained from the thigh according to size. This is successively incorporated into the forearm skin defect. Application of a hydrogel-Mepilex dressing. Application of a loose compress dressing, wrapping with absorbent cotton. The arm is fixed in a Kramer splint in a functional position and wrapped with an elastic bandage. The arm was applied before the anastomosis suture. Arm always well perfused, saturation 100%. Finally, removal of the laryngectomy tube. Insertion of an 8 mm tracheostomy tube, which is fixed with sutures. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is intubated and ventilated and transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Final consultation with the anesthesia department. Please continue heparin perfusor 500 I.U./hour as started intraoperatively, also postoperatively for 5 days. Check the blood circulation of the flap clinically and via suture marking on the left side of the neck in a typical manner according to the plan. Please continue antibiotics as started intraoperatively with Unacid 3 g for 2-3 days. Feeding for approx. 10 days via the inserted PEG tube, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Determine adjuvant therapy according to the final histological findings in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

Somewhat granular mucosal conditions in the area of the postcricoid region, therefore choose a larger safety distance and demonstration to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who recommends a sparing resection in the area of the postcricoid region, otherwise coordination of the procedure. Further resection of the tumor on all sides with at least a 1.5 cm safety margin on all sides. Lateral to the tumor, removal of a soft tissue mantle, palpatorily no deep growth towards the soft tissues of the neck. In the meantime, tracheotomy has already been performed. Initially a visual tracheotomy. Re-intubation onto an LE tube. Now resection caudal removal of the tumor approx. 2-3 cm above the esophageal inlet. Removal of the trachea after previous snaring and removal of the resectate. The specimen now shows macroscopic removal in toto on all sides. ............. Hypopharyngeal carcinoma but now cover the tumor. Take contiguous mucosal samples over the entire resection area. These are thread-marked and later assessed in rapid diagnostics as completely free of tumor and dysplasia. A caudally tapering strip of mucosa is now visible, but with at least 4-5 cm of residual mucosa caudally to cranially. It was therefore decided to perform a primary reconstruction with the local mucosa. After palpation, perform a myotomy in the area of the upper oesophageal sphincter and insert an 8 mm provost prosthesis using the usual pull-through method with puncture about 1 cm caudal to the future tracheostoma edge and insertion of a nasogastric tube and meticulous mucosal suture with 3.0 Vicryl while inverting the .................... Caudal pharyngeal suture area and base of tongue on both sides, thin pharyngeal mucosa circumscribed on the right side, this is later reinforced with pharyngeal musculature with an overall well-preserved and strong tube. Now in the pharyngeal muscles and inversion of the submucosal pharyngeal suture. Finally, caudal suturing of the pharyngeal tube with the thyroid flap and final suturing of the infrahyoid muscles to the base of the tongue and over the pharyngeal sutures. The tracheostoma was sutured in place beforehand, with a second skin incision and circular suturing of the trachea. Finally, stable tracheostoma. Final wound inspection. Circumscribed meticulous hemostasis with generally dry wound conditions. Irrigation with Ringer's solution and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 mm Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Finally, reintubation to a 10-gauge tracheoflex cannula and completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics and Unacid 1.5 g; please continue this antibiotic treatment for 3 days postoperatively. The X-ray emesis was performed on the 8th postoperative day. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT4a cN2c G3 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the left. After receiving the definitive histology, presentation at our interdisciplinary tumor conference to plan adjuvant therapy.","Partial pharyngectomy with laryngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Provox Prosthesis, Endoscopy

No infiltration of the bone could be identified on CT, albeit with limited assessability. Therefore transoral resection planned and neck dissection.","Insertion of the oral spatula according to McIvor. Exposure of the tumor. The position of the tumor is shown, which grows from the soft palate in the cranial area and upper tonsil area towards the alveolar ridge and hard palate. First, the tumor is cut around the mucosal area with a safety margin of at least 1 cm in all areas. Resection includes the entire tonsil, anterior palatal arch, mucosa of the alveolar ridge and lower anterior parts of the buccal mucosa. The posterior molar is located at the tumor margins. It is therefore removed. The tumor extends to the alveolar ridge. Push off the bone here. Further removal of the tumor also basally. This is successful in the area of the tonsil or pharyngeal wall. In the area of the pterygoid muscles and the ascending mandibular branch, the tumor grows in depth. This reaches the ascending mandibular branch and clearly erodes it. Further displacement of the tumor from the bone. The inferior alveolar nerve is also infiltrated in the tumor and is removed. Tumor preparation is removed. Suture marking: Suture blue short-short anterior, alveolar ridge lateral short-long, anterior alveolar ridge medial long-long, marginal specimen ( tonsil medial ). Green suture: short-short medial ( hard palate ) short-long cranial at hard palate/cheek junction, long-long soft palate basal retrotonsillar. Suture purple: long-long basal at the level of the soft tissue on the hard palate, short-long soft tissue basal lower tonsil pole. In addition, marginal sample of soft tissue at the lateral alveolar ridge, marginal sample from the buccal fat plug and marginal sample from the buccal mucosa extending from the hard palate to the lateral aleolar ridge. Overall: Bone infiltration with significant bone erosion both in the area of the ascending mandibular branch and in the area of the alveolus in the last molar. Due to the situation, <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the maxillofacial surgery department was consulted. Findings confirmed by colleague. Joint decision to transfer patient to maxillofacial surgery, as removal of the mandible and surrounding soft tissue is required for rehabilitation. Primary RCT does not appear to make sense in the case of significant bone infiltration. Subsequent PEG placement. Insertion of the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach. No abnormalities were found on gross examination. After diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm stomach wall tube without complications. This is fixed to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Completion of the procedure without complications.

Oro-hypopharyngoscopy: Inconspicuous mucosal conditions in the oropharynx, base of tongue and tonsil region. Inspection and palpation unremarkable. Hypopharynx left inconspicuous. From the end of the oropharynx to the beginning of the hypopharyngeal entrance on the left, an exophytic tumor is visible, which fills the entire piriform sinus from the lateral wall over the medial wall and over the postcricoid area to the opposite side. Esophageal entrance free. The above-mentioned operation is therefore confirmed, although the indication for flap plasty can probably only be definitively determined intraoperatively. PEG placement: Advancement of the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach. No evidence of tumor on gross examination, but conspicuous hyperplastic ......stone-like mucosal conditions in the cardia and corpus, antrum flatter. Check-up by an internist recommended. A 15 mm abdominal wall probe is then inserted in the typical manner after diaphanoscopy. Fixation to the abdominal wall. Subsequent repositioning for neck dissection on both sides, laryngectomy. Injection not possible. Sterile draping after skin disinfection. An apron flap is first created subplatysmally in the typical manner up to the level of the hyoid bone and submandibular gland, whereby the capsule should be included in the neck preparation. Subsequent neck dissection, initially on the right side: visualization of the sternocleidomastoid anterior border, visualization of the omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. V. jugularis interna, facialis, A. carotis interna and externa as well as A. carotis communis. Exposure and preservation of vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve, accessorius nerve. Subsequent removal of the medial neck preparation, initially preserving the superior thyroid artery. Then develop the dorsal neck specimen, exposing and preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Careful hemostasis and irrigation with H202 and Ringer's solution. Overall evacuation level 2-5, whereby suspicious nodes were found in the cranial area level 2. Neck dissection on the left side: This is performed in the same way as on the right side. Level 2-5 clearance is also performed here, followed by laryngectomy and subtotal pharyngectomy. First, exposure and skeletonization of the hyoid bone and removal of the suprahyoid muscles. Removal of the prelaryngeal soft tissue, which is preserved as level 6. Subsequent dissection of the infrahyoid musculature from the hyoid bone and cutting caudally. On the left, problem-free skeletonization of the larynx by ...... of the superior chorda and dissection of the constrictor pharyngis muscle as well as dissection of the thyroid gland caudo-laterally. Dissection of the piriform sinus on this side. The superior thyroid artery is exposed and preserved. Subsequent dissection on the opposite side in the direction of the tumor. It becomes apparent that the tumor has most likely infiltrated the soft tissue next to the pharyngeal wall. Therefore, the upper pole of the thyroid gland is undercut and resected. In the area of the thyroid resection region, a suture is placed under and over the wall. The larynx is resected as a whole up to the thyroid gland, including the pharyngeal wall and upper thyroid pole. All soft tissue in the hyoid bone area is also resected pre-epiglottis. Now enter the left paramedian larynx. A tumor is revealed. This is resected successively with a safety margin of at least 1 to 1 ˝ cm in all directions. The entire pharyngeal wall on the right including the posterior wall is removed. A remnant of the posterior wall and the entire lateral piriform sinus wall remain. The entire postcricoid region must be resected in the direction of the esophageal opening, resulting in unfavorable and very narrow conditions. Before this, the thyroid isthmus, which is very thin, is cut through and the trachea is exposed and the trachea is opened in the 1st/2nd intercartilaginous space and sutured to the skin of the neck. The larynx with the entire pharyngeal wall on the right including the upper pole of the thyroid gland and the entire postcricoid region up to the esophageal entrance is then removed. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section examination. Carcinoma in situ on the left side in the frozen section. A 2-3 mm thick strip from the left resection margin is therefore cut again. Subsequently, another marginal sample approx. 2 mm wide is taken, which is also marked with a suture. The frozen section still shows mild to moderate dysplasia, no indication for further resection. Thus an overall R0 situation. What remains is a strip that is too narrow, barely 2-3 cm wide, particularly in the direction of the esophageal opening. Primary suturing does not seem sensible in terms of preserving the swallowing function. The decision was therefore made to cover the defect with a flap. Due to the patient's poor vascular situation, his secondary diseases and the favorable soft tissue conditions in the thoracic region, which allow a very thin flap to be elevated, the defect is covered using a pectoralis major flap from the right. First, the entire wound area was irrigated with H202 and Ringer's solution and the bleeding was carefully stopped. Then measure the size of the defect. Flap size is 10 x 8 cm. Corresponding trapezoidal shape in the direction of the esophageal opening. This is followed by elevation of the pectoralis major flap, provox creation and defect coverage in the pharyngeal region: after measuring the length of the pedicle, the defect is marked on the thoracic wall. Subfascial elevation of a bridge of the deltopectoral flap is then performed. Dissection under the pectoralis muscle and exposure of the vascular pedicle. Subsequently, successive incision of the skin island and development of the myocutaneous pectoralis major flap along the flap pedicle, taking into account the course of the vessel. Dissection up to the clavicle. Subsequent careful hemostasis in the thoracic region. Pull the pedicle through under the further deltopectoral skin bridge. Insertion of the skin island into the defect area. First myotomy and placement of the Provox prosthesis. For this purpose, the muscles on the left side in the area of the constrictor pharyngis muscle are successively cut with the scalpel and the scissors up to the mucosa. This allows better passage of the finger into the esophageal opening. Subsequent insertion of an 8.0 Provox prosthesis in a typical manner without complications. Insertion takes place 1-1.5 cm below the upper tracheal border. Then successive suturing of the pectoralis major flap into the defect, taking particular care to ensure that the passage into the upper esophagus is not too narrow. Tension-free suturing of the flap. Left lateral and cranial 2nd muscle suture over the flap. Muscle pedicle comes to lie over the suture on the right side. Careful hemostasis again. Irrigation with Ringer's solution. Skin closure in the neck area by placing the apron flap back with insertion of a Redon drainage in each side of the neck and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Insertion of a 9 mm tracheal cannula. Now wound closure in the thorax area. It turns out that the skin can no longer be mobilized in such a way that primary closure is possible. Therefore covering in the thigh area. Split skin 0.5 mm thick is removed with the dermatome. Primary closure in the thoracic region as far as possible. A residual defect remains, which is covered with split skin. A total of 2 Redon drains are inserted in the axillary area and next to the flap pedicle. Mepilex with Chitogel is applied to the thoracic wound and thigh wound as a wound dressing. The procedure was completed without complications. Overall cT3-4 hypopharyngeal carcinoma with infiltration of the postcricoid area and larynx. At least cN2b status. Patient goes to intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics for a total of one week with Unacid 1.5 g 3 x/die. Feeding via inserted PEG for 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Inserted feeding tube should remain in place for splinting.","TU resection, Neck dissection

Sterile wiping and covering of the patient and injection of supra in the area of the U-shaped incision. Start of the operation by tracheotomy. To do this, make an incision below the cricoid. Cut through the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infralaryngeal musculature and division of the musculature in the midline. Identification of the cricoid cartilage and sharp dissection of the cricoid cartilage. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus and coagulation of the same. After transection of the thyroid isthmus, identification of the anterior tracheal wall and sharp entry into the 2nd to 3rd intertracheal annular gap and creation of a tracheostoma in the usual manner using epithelializing single-button sutures. Insertion of an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube. Subsequent transition to transoral tumor resection. Once the tumor has been positioned, the tumor, which occupies the right tonsil lobe, is resected caudally starting parauvularly macroscopically in healthy musculature using the ultrasonic knife. Laterally, the resection margin extends to the soft tissue of the neck. Caudally, the glossotonsillar groove as well as adjacent parts of the base of the tongue must be included in the resected area. The entire resectate is then sent for a frozen section histological examination for orientation. This reveals narrow resection margins in the area of the tumor base as well as in the area of the base of the tongue. Therefore, a transoral resection from the base of the tumor is performed as far as possible, as well as an extensive resection in the area of the medial base of the tongue. These prove to be free of tumor on frozen section histology. Subsequent transition to neck dissection, initially on the right side. After making the apron flap incision, a radical neck dissection is performed here, as the large metastasis has already infiltrated the internal jugular vein together with the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the accessorius nerve. The vascular nerve sheath is therefore located caudally, the jugular vein is exposed and then cut off and severed. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is also cut caudally. The entire preparation is thus successively developed cranially with resection of parts of the cervical plexus. The hypoglossal nerve as well as the common carotid artery and external carotid artery can be dissected from the metastasis in a healthy layer. The cranial resection also includes the caudal part of the parotid gland. Finally, the internal jugular vein is exposed just below the jugular foramen, dissected free and also removed there. Creation of a Redon suction drainage. Transition to neck dissection on the opposite side. There is no evidence of a suspicious lymph node metastasis. Selective neck dissection is performed in regions II to V, sparing all non-lymphatic structures. Then skeletonize the lingual artery, which will later be used for anastomosis. On the right side, create the passage into the hypopharynx from the lateral side. With a good view of the caudal resection margin, tissue from the adjacent tongue base and the vallecula to the lingual epiglottis is resected again and examined using frozen section histology. This was also found to be R0. In addition, the external carotid artery is freed of all remaining fatty and connective tissue in the oropharyngeal direction in the sense of a further resection from the tumor base; this tissue is also ultimately found to be tumor-free on frozen section histology, so that an overall R0 resection can be assumed. Subsequent removal of a radial lobe graft of the appropriate size by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (6 x 10 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Covering of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Subsequent removal of region I with resection of the submandibular gland on the right side after exposing and sparing the ramus marginalis mandibulae. The radial flap is then inserted into the oropharyngeal defect and sutured into the defect starting transorally. The final sutures are placed transcervically from the caudal side. The vascular pedicle is then guided to the opposite side. Here the lingual artery is anastomosed end-to-end with the radial artery. The venous anastomoses are made through 2 veins of the radial flap in an end-to-side manner to the internal jugular vein. Finally, a Redon suction drain and a flap are placed in the left side of the neck in the usual manner. Folding back of the apron flap, completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis of the tracheostoma and two-layer wound closure in the usual manner. Suturing of the tracheostomy tube after reintubation of the patient and completion of the procedure and transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Placement of the PEG tube: Flexible pre-scanning with the gastroesophagoscope into the stomach. Identification of the anterior wall of the stomach and performance of a positive diaphanoscopy. Insertion of the PEG tube in the usual manner using the thread pull-through method without complications. Careful reflection and termination of the PEG insertion without complications. Conclusion: Combined transoral-transcervical tumor resection of an oropharyngeal carcinoma with extension into the glossotonsillar groove on the right side. Radical neck dissection on the right and selective neck dissection on the left, reconstruction of the oropharyngeal defect on the right with a microvascularly anastomosed radial flap graft from the left forearm, creation of a plastic tracheostoma and a PEG tube, anastomosis of the microvascular radial flap graft on the opposite side to the lingual artery and in an end-to-side manner to the internal jugular vein.","Right tumor tonsillectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Pedicled flap (Pectoralis major)

Subsequently, transition to transoral tumor resection. After adjusting the oropharynx with the tonsil retractor, a somewhat uneven mucosa can be seen in the area of the left tonsil. An exophytic or easily palpable tumor is not visible. If a caudal view of the lateral pharyngeal wall is possible with the retractor, a caudal tissue sample is taken to determine the extent of the carcinoma, which is not clearly visible. This sample proves positive in the frozen section histological diagnosis. Then start with monopolar tumor resection on the left side. The entire tonsil lobe is resected successively, starting at the parauvular left upper tonsil pole and removing the left anterior palatine arch and the adjacent posterior palatine arch with transition to the medial posterior hypopharyngeal wall. The entire musculature up to the soft tissues of the neck and the adjacent vessels is successively resected caudally. About 3/4 of the tumor is developed transorally downwards as far as possible. Subsequently, marginal sections are removed from the posterior wall of the hypopharynx, from the upper tonsil pole and from the lateral margin. Isolated tumor cell nests can still be found caudally in the area of the lateral margin, the remaining resected sections are tumor-free. Further excision will then be performed transcervically after completion of the neck dissection. Transition to neck dissection on the left side. A large fixed metastasis can already be palpated at the junction of regions II and III. After skin incision, dissection of the skin platysma flap laterally. The platysma is incised over the metastasis so that the skin can finally be moved laterally. Locate the vascular nerve sheath under the omohyoid muscle caudally. Trace the omohyoid muscle ventrally upwards. Then expose the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. Also expose the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. It can now be seen that the entire tumor block has even reached the caudal submandibular gland. Therefore, this is first removed by dissecting the facial vein and the facial artery while identifying and protecting the lingual nerve. In this way, the tumor block can be successively developed laterally starting at the submandibular gland while exposing and sparing the hypoglossal nerve. The external carotid artery, the carotid bifurcation and the common carotid artery are then exposed and released. The internal jugular vein is completely infiltrated, as are the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the accessorius nerve. Therefore, the internal jugular vein is deposited under the posterior belly of the digastric muscle after it has been found at the base of the skull. The internal jugular vein is also removed caudally in the area at the level of the clavicle. Dissection of the large tumor block and removal of the insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the tip of the mastoid. It is now apparent that the entire neck is full of hard nodular metastases down to the depth of the brachial plexus. The resection is therefore carried out as extensively as necessary and possible. The entire tumor block is successively resected radically, resecting all branches of the cervical plexus. Follow the tumor masses caudally, exposing and skeletonizing the phrenic nerve. The last metastasis is dissected free from the subclavian vein under traction. This leaves only the common carotid artery, the vagus nerve and the hypoglossal nerve on the left neck. Then widening of the opening in the neck and disluxation of the partially resected tumor. Then complete the tumor resection with parts of the base of the tongue and the remaining lateral to ................................. margin. This shows that the tumor has in principle grown through the lateral pharyngeal wall per continuitatem to the external carotid artery and can be detached from this in a healthy layer. After resection of an extensive section of the base of the tongue, as it is also affected by frozen section histology, all marginal sections of the base of the tongue as well as the remaining caudal and lateral hypopharyngeal wall are then tumor-free. Subsequent transition to elevation of the radial lobe graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (13 cm x 5.5 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Covering of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Now transition to neck dissection on the right side. Here, regions I-V are also selectively removed while preserving all lymphatic structures. Here too, a large lymph node metastasis is found in region II. The facial artery is then dissected beyond the lower jaw so that it can later be used for anastomosis. The V. facialis is also dissected as far beyond the mandible as possible while sparing the ramus marginalis mandibulae and cut caudally. After removal of the radialis graft, it is first sutured transcervically in the area of the base of the tongue and the caudal lateral hypopharyngeal wall at the level of the epiglottis and the vallecula. The remaining sutures are then performed transorally. After creating a transition to the opposite side, the flap pedicle is then transferred to the opposite side at the level of the hyoid. Here the arterial anastomosis of the radial artery to the facial artery is performed. The venous outflow is connected to the facial vein in an end-to-side manner via a vein in the flap. The 2nd humeral vein has a corresponding length so that it can be connected to the internal jugular vein on the right side in an end-to-side manner. A Redon suction drain and a drainage flap are then placed on the right side. Multi-layer wound closure. Completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis of the tracheostoma. Re-intubation of the patient. End of the operation, transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Resection of a tonsillar carcinoma on the left side cT3 with radical neck dissection on the left and selective neck dissection region I-V on the right side. Reconstruction with a microvascularly anastomosed radial flap from the left forearm, which is inserted into the orohypopharyngeal defect on the left side and whose stalk is anastomosed to the right vascular nerve sheath. Due to the extensive tumor findings, adjuvant radiochemotherapy is strongly recommended.","Resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy, PEG placement

PEG insertion: insertion of the esophagoscope into the stomach. No abnormalities found during a thorough examination. After diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube in a typical manner without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the tumor region. Insertion of the McIVOR oral spatula and inspection of the tumor region. The tumor starts on the soft palate parauvularly on the right and extends over the tonsillar lobe to the base of the tongue, it also grows into the edge of the tongue on the right side. Now sterile washing and draping. Start with transoral tumor resection. Here the operation is performed with an electric needle and partly with scissors and bipolar forceps. In the area of the base of the tongue, the overview is so difficult that it is no longer possible to operate transorally. Now create an apron flap and expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and submandibular gland. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and exposure of the hyoid bone and continuation of the tumor resection from transcervical. To do this, the digastric muscle must be cut and the tumor must be luted through from transoral to cervical. Then successively cut around the tumor in the tongue base area so that the tumor can be completely resected en bloc with a safety margin of 1.5 cm. The tumor preparation is placed on cork and marked as a whole for frozen section. All tumor margins are assessed as free. Now complete the neck dissection on the right side. For this, free preparation of the internal jugular vein, the facial vein and the external jugular vein. There are several large metastases in level II a and b. Part of the cervical plexus must also be removed as the metastases are fused to it and the accessorius cannot be preserved either. The border cord of the vagus nerve and the hypoglossal nerve can be preserved. Then send in the neck dissection level individually as part of the lymph node study. On the opposite side, neck dissection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is also visualized for this. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, the accessorius nerve and clearing of the neck levels II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. The neck levels are also sent in individually as part of the lymph node study. Repositioning for tracheotomy. Perform a visor tracheotomy between the second and third tracheal cartilage through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and create a mucocutaneous anastomosis. Lifting of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Parallel to this, lift the split skin from the right thigh with the dermatome 7.5 mm. Then dissection of the neck vessels under the microscope on the right side. The external jugular vein, the facial vein with one outlet and the superior thyroid artery are dissected. The lingual artery was resected as part of the tumor resection and is dissected as a stump for the anastomosis. Then transfer of the operation to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Elevation of the radialis graft: Marking of the graft (6 x 11 cm) on the distal forearm. Incision of the graft and transection of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue and the forearm fascia. Exposure of the confluence in the crook of the elbow and dissection along the cephalic vein to the radial flap edge. Integration of the cephalic vein into the graft. Raise the cephalic vein and expose the external ramus of the radial nerve. Ulnar preparation subfascially up to the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Locate the distal stump of the radial artery. Undermining with a clamp and clamping of the radial artery. A good perfusion signal can be recorded the entire time. Dissection of the radial artery and ligation of the stumps. Elevation of the radial artery flap from the wound bed, with constant bipolar coagulation of smaller vessels and placement of vascular clips. This is done while protecting the radial nerve. Dissection of the blood vessels in the crook of the elbow and removal of the flap, first of the artery and then of the vein. Lifting of the graft without complications. Wound closure using split skin from the lower leg by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Then insertion of the radial flap: The radial flap is inserted into the defect and successively sutured into the defect both transcervically and transorally, partly with the sutures in place. This is achieved without tension using 3-0 Vicryl single-button sutures followed by dissection of the superior thyroid artery and an outlet from the internal jugular vein as well as dissection of the external jugular vein. All vessels are conditioned for vascular anastomosis. After conditioning the radial artery anastomosis, this is then connected to the superior thyroid artery. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. Then conditioning of the cephalic veins. One is anastomosed with the external jugular vein using a 3.5 mm vessel coupler. After opening the clamps, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The second smaller part of the superficial venous outflow is anastomosed with the outlet from the internal jugular vein using a 2-0 coupler. Here too, good venous return after opening the clamps. Positive smear phenomenon. A small outlet, which corresponds to the confluence, is clipped. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Inspection of the flap shows good perfusion. Extensive irrigation and hemostasis. Wound closure in layers and epithelialization of the tracheostoma, insertion of a Redon drain on the left and 2 flaps on the right. The forearm was treated in the typical manner with a Mepilex swab dressing and fixed and attached to a Cramer splint. A hydrogel dressing was applied to the thigh area. The tracheostomy tube was fixed with sutures. The procedure was completed without complications. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue the antibiotic treatment started intraoperatively for approx. 1 week. Nutrition via the inserted PEG tube for 7-10 days. Then gruel and, if necessary, build up the diet. Monitoring of the flap for 5 days by Doppler or clinically. Heparin 500 E/h as a perfusor for 5 days. After receiving the final histology, presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), PEG placement

This is successful without any problems. Mirroring up to the carina. This is clear on all sides. In the area of the posterior tracheal wall, a small induration or protrusion can be seen paramedian to the left about 5 cm subglottically. This is not exophytic and does not appear primarily suspicious for malignancy. Then problem-free intubation by the surgeon. Positioning by the surgeon. Esophagogastroscopy is performed first. Enter with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Mirroring into the stomach without any problems. Here, food residues are clearly visible, but after aspiration of these, the mucosal conditions are unremarkable on all sides. On endoscopy, clear mucosal changes in the sense of reflux esophagitis are noticeable. Otherwise, however, no exophytic masses. Now enter with the small bore tube. Inspection of the hypopharynx. The hypopharynx is clearly visible up to the esophageal entrance, even the postcricoid region is clear without exophytic masses. No suspicious changes in the area of the base of the tongue, vallecula and epiglottis. Adjustment of the endolarynx. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions without exophytic tumor growth. Inspection of the oral cavity. A coarse, whitish, circumscribed change in the right glossotonsillar groove is seen in the area of the transition to the alveolar ridge anteriorly on the edge of the tongue, the mucosa is slightly reddened and uneven and leads to clearly leukoplakic changes in the area of the edge of the tongue, transitioning to the floor of the mouth, with whitish, non-wipeable coatings. The decision is made to excise the suspicious, indurated mass, which, however, does not move into the base of the tongue on palpation, while at the same time taking the suspicious mucosal changes anteriorly. Now first insert the mouth retractor and mark the resection margins with the electric needle. Dissection with scissors, removing the mucosal changes in the area of the tumorous changes. Removal of the mucosa and the underlying submucosal tissue up to the former tonsil lobe or base of the tongue. All preparation steps under careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. The preparation is now marked with sutures. It extends from the right glossotonsillar groove over the alveolar ridge to the anterior third of the right edge of the tongue, passing over to the floor of the mouth. This is followed by thread marking in the anterior (long/long) and lateral (short/short) directions. Representative edge samples are then taken in the area of the anterior edge of the tongue as well as halfway along the area of the floor of the mouth transition and the back of the tongue medially and finally a resection in the area of the cranial tonsil lobe. Then renewed careful inspection and hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Insertion of hydrogen and Ringer swabs. Meticulous hemostasis. Finally, absolutely dry wound conditions.

Histology revealed a carcinoma in situ on the right alveolar ridge and a G3 differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and carcinoma in situ on the right anterior palatal arch. Post-resection with intraoperative frozen section diagnostics was discussed at the interdisciplinary tumor conference.,"Team time out and induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues with intubation. Dental status determined. Insertion of the Mc Ivor oral spatula and exposure of the right oropharynx: A slightly rough, spherical protrusion with smooth mucosa, approx. 0.8 cm in diameter, can be seen in the area of the former ablation on the anterior right palatal arch. Laterocaudally, the alveolar ridge is somewhat exposed after previous surgery. In addition, there is a leukoplakia on the right posterior palatal arch, which was not present 4 weeks ago, measuring approx. 3 x 6 mm longitudinally oval. No other new mucosal abnormalities in the rest of the oropharynx. Infiltration of the anterior and posterior right palatal arch with local anesthesia, Ultracaine 2% with the addition of Suprarenin. Now excision biopsy of the leukoplakia on the right posterior palatal arch with a 5 mm safety margin using a scalpel and pointed scissors. Suture marking still in the surgical site at 12 o'clock (cranial) and at 9 o'clock (lateral). The frozen section examination according to the telephone announcement by the pathologists shows a 2 cm large carcinoma in situ in the resectate, whereby a marginal formation in the frozen section at 12 o'clock cannot be ruled out, thus recommendation for subsequent resection, which takes place later. First, the already planned resection on the anterior palatal arch on the right: with a safety margin of approx. 5 mm, the raised, rough mass is cut around with the scalpel and pointed scissors on a smooth mucosal surface. Here too, suture marking in the surgical site at 6 o'clock (caudal) and 9 o'clock (lateral). The required size of the resection results in a defect in the anterior palatal arch, which is later adapted. According to the pathology department, the frozen section examination shows an invasive carcinoma of 0.2 cm originating from the CIS, which forms the cranial margin and also a moderate degree of dysplasia laterally, whereby it cannot be clearly distinguished from the CIS in the frozen section. Therefore recommendation for resection here as well. Preoperative demonstration to the previous surgeon <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Now case discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, also based on the tumor conference decision, see file. Now indication for subsequent resection at the above-mentioned sites in accordance with the pathological recommendation, this time for definitive histology as well as an additional biopsy on the left anterior palatal arch in macroscopically unremarkable conditions to clarify whether a carcinoma in situ is also present here in the current case of field carcinomatization. Then discussion at the tumor conference and no PEG placement today. Now follow-up resections: Posterior palatal arch on the right: cranial resection of an approx. 5 mm wide strip of mucosa using a scalpel and pointed scissors. This is marked with sutures in the operating theater, both medially and cranially. Send in for definitive histology. Right anterior palatal arch resection: resection of a 5 mm wide strip of mucosa using a scalpel and pointed scissors, covering the entire area from medial to cranial to laterocaudal, triple suture markings. Sketch/photo with all markings see file. Finally, the right anterior palatal arch is adapted into the wound bed with Vicryl 4-0. No bleeding. In addition, biopsy of the left anterior palatal arch. No bleeding. Finally, insertion of a nasogastric feeding tube due to the extensive resection defect in the right oropharynx. Position control under direct vision and auscultatory with air insufflation. The procedure was completed without complications. Conclusion: Post-resection of the anterior right palatal arch for invasive squamous cell carcinoma originating from a carcinoma in situ and excisional biopsy of the posterior right palatal arch for carcinoma in situ; frozen section control. An additional resection of both sites was performed and will be followed by definitive histology. In case of suspected field carcinoma, biopsy of the left anterior palatal arch in a pale mucosal area. Procedure: Discussion in the tumor conference of the definitive histologies of the frozen section and the post-resectates. A PEG was deliberately avoided (see above). A PEG should only be inserted if radiochemotherapy is definitely indicated. Nasogastric tube in the right oropharynx for 3-5 days depending on the findings.","Excisional biopsy

For this reason, there is an indication for renewed microlaryngoscopy and an attempt at partial resection according to Leroux-Robert.","Transferring the patient to the operating theater and positioning the patient. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department and performance of the team time-out. If the tooth status is poor, insert the mouthguard and insert the small irrigation tube. The tube is removed for this purpose. Inspection with 0° optics. Here you can see an exophytic mass affecting the entire left vocal fold and extending into the laryngeal ventricle and the subglottis. The anterior commissure is also infiltrated and the anterior 3 mm of the right vocal fold. With Cormack I, the patient can also be adjusted very well with the size C small bore tube. However, due to the infiltration of the anterior commissure, the mass is not laser resectable. Now demonstration of the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who advises a partial resection of the larynx according to Leroux-Robert. For this reason, placement of the accesses and the permanent catheter from the anesthesia. Injection, sterile ablation and draping. Marking the landmarks. Skin incision in a zigzag shape and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature and separation from it in the linea alba. Exposure of the larynx from the thyroid incisura to the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the larynx in the sense of a dissection of the periosteum. Now saw open the larynx paramedian on the right side and cut the ligamentum conicum at this point. Open the larynx and inspect it. The larynx is opened paramedianally on the right side in order to be able to resect the anterior commissure and the anterior part of the right vocal fold. No tumor is now macroscopically visible here. The larynx is stretched open and the tumor is followed to the left side. Here the tumor is successively removed with the pointed scissors and the 15 mm scalpel as well as bipolar coagulation at a distance of approx. 1 cm. Basally, the thyroid cartilage is completely exposed and freed from the periosteum with the Freer. This is done without any problems and can be pushed off easily. Now successive further dissection of the tumor under suture marking and taking of the marginal samples during the resection. The proc vocalis of the arytenoid cartilage is infiltrated in the posterior region. For this reason, add <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. As the remaining part of the arytenoid cartilage can remain in place and swallowing should therefore be possible and a tracheostomy should be avoided, the vocal process is removed and the remaining arytenoid cartilage is left in place. Now take circular margin samples. Make 4 drill holes through the thyroid cartilage. Careful hemostasis and waiting for the frozen section. This was found to be tumor-free everywhere, with infiltrates only visible in the paraglottic space on the left side. This is resected again and circular margin samples are taken again. These are again sent for frozen section and are tumor-free. An R0 situation can therefore be assumed in the frozen section. It must be expressly mentioned here that the resection was performed with restraint at the express wish of the patient in order to protect the arytenoid cartilage and avoid a permanent tracheostomy. A further resection would have led to an opening of the pharynx and thus to a laryngectomy, which the patient also refused. In the current R0 situation, suture the right vocal fold anteriorly to improve vocal fold tension and successive hemostasis. Pharyngeal mucosa is visible on the left side, but is intact. Insertion of fibrin glue. Now suture the ligamentum conicum to the thyroid cartilage and insert a Keel. Closure of the prelaryngeal musculature as well as the subcutaneous fatty tissue and skin after insertion of a flap. Now insertion of a nasogastric tube and demonstration of the findings to the anesthesia colleagues. End of the operation. Conclusion: V.a. cT2 cN0 cM0 transglottic laryngeal carcinoma on the left side. Neck dissection on both sides was omitted due to the cN0 neck status after consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The frozen section showed an R0 resection. The final histology should be awaited and the patient should be presented at the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","MLE (Microlaryngoscopy and Endoscopy), Attempted partial laryngeal resection (Leroux Robert)

The tumor was found to be laser resectable at the pre-panendoscopy. Histologically squamous cell carcinoma. The above-mentioned operation was therefore indicated.,"First positioning of the head, insertion of the mouthguard and insertion of the MLE tube size C and D alternately. The tumor, which is located in the area of the left vocal fold, is revealed. Compared to the previous assessment, the tumor is significantly larger and the growth is not only limited to the vocal fold, but also extends in the direction of the morgue sinus and is significantly more broad-based in the anterior commissure. The tumor is now resected with the laser at the back of the healthy area. Resection extends cranially to above the left pocket crease, resection is performed at the same height in the anterior commissure. Resection extends to the cartilage due to the significantly enlarged tumor growth. Adjustability of the anterior commissure, with relatively voluminous tumor, significantly more difficult. The tumor is therefore reduced in size and removed using the piecemeal technique. This significantly improves the overview. Resection extends slightly over the commissure to the right side at the very front. Detachment of the tumor. Dissection of the cartilage in the area of the anterior commissure. Destruction of the cartilage is evident here and tumor growth into the cartilage, therefore indication for an external procedure. The patient is repositioned and a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline is injected. A Z-shaped skin incision is then made prelaryngeally, ending in a Kocher collar incision. Dissection to the prelaryngeal muscle. This is split in the middle. A pZZZZcondral flap is dissected from the left over the anterior commissure. The cartilage is not infiltrated or even perforated on the outside. A median thyrotomy is created by cutting out a triangle or box-shaped piece of cartilage to the left. Cartilage is resected from the right paramedian to the left via the possible infiltration zone on the inside. Overview now improved. Mucosal remnants with tumor residues lying in front of the cartilage are also resected. Also soft tissue on the left caudal side in front of the cartilage. Co-resection of the ligamentum conicum. Marginal samples are taken in the area of the anterior commissure caudally from the area of the thyroid membrane, caudally on the left in the subglottic area, thread-marked in the arytenoid area, the soft tissue basally, supraglottically in the middle in the area of the anterior commissure, supraglottically on the left thread-marked as well as in the area of the right pouch ligament and vocal cord on the opposite side. All marginal samples go to the frozen section. Relatively little epithelium in the supraglottic center frozen section, but only slight dysplasia visible here. With a currently comprehensible R0 status, mucosa is again removed from the cranial area to be on the safe side, here already at the lower edge of the petiolus. However, this marginal sample is sent for final assessment. The removed cartilage and the fragmented tumor are also sent for final assessment. This is followed by careful hemostasis. The tracheostoma is created after the thyroid gland has been severed in the isthmus area. This is treated with stitches. Visualization of the trachea. Creation of a broadly pedicled Björk flap in the 2nd/3rd intermediate cartilage. Epithelialization of this. Subsequently, closure of the thyroid cartilage via drilled holes. The perichondrium flap is then placed over the thyrofissure and covers it completely. Fixation with 4-0 Vicryl single button sutures on the soft tissues caudally and on the perichondrium on the opposite side. Cranial suture of the soft tissues also with 4-0 Vicryl single button sutures with 4-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Then suture the infrahyoid musculature above with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Then insertion of a flap. Layered skin closure in the typical manner. After lateral tracheotomy, an 8 mm tracheostomy tube was inserted. The procedure was completed without complications. Overall cT2 laryngeal carcinoma of the left vocal fold, growing into the anterior commissure. Therefore switch from transoral laser resection to frontolateral partial laryngectomy. Overall signs of a relatively fast-growing tumor. Microscopically R0 resection intraoperatively. Postoperative swallowing test, if problems persist insertion of a gastric tube and temporary feeding via this. Then presentation to the voice and speech department to initiate swallowing training as soon as possible. However, the swallowing function should not be impaired by the defect in the larynx area. Wait for the final marginal samples and discuss the further procedure at the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Endoscopic laser resection, Tracheotomy

In addition, the patient has a history of papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid gland on the right with complete thyroidectomy and central neck dissection in 2013 and has noticed a mass under the tongue since <2016>. Mirror findings revealed an exophytic mass on the anterior floor of the mouth on the left side in addition to several leukoplakic changes. There was also an exophytic mass in the piriform sinus on the left side, hence the indication for the above-mentioned procedure. In the tumor conference, the surgical procedure was concluded as the patient was not suitable for primary radiochemotherapy due to renal insufficiency.","Induction of anesthesia and intubation transnasally via the anesthesia colleagues. Then first resection of the carcinoma of the floor of the mouth with the monopolar needle, bipolar forceps and scissors. The specimen is placed on cork, including edge samples for a frozen section. Carcinoma in situ is still visible in 2 places, on the lateral edge of the tongue at the transition to the floor of the mouth and in the middle on the underside of the tongue. On the underside of the tongue, a further 2 x resection is required until the edges of the carcinoma in itu are free. This results in an 8 x 5 cm defect in the floor of the mouth and the underside of the tongue. The ostium of the Wharton's duct on the left side is also covered by the tumor, as is the duct, so that no duct probing could be performed here and the duct and ostium as well as parts of the sublingual gland were resected. The remaining parts of the gland are coagulated in a bipolar fashion and later left open. The right ostium of the Wharton's duct is not affected by the tumor resection. Now turn to the neck. Creation of an apron flap in the usual manner, then parallel neck dissection on the right <CLINICIAN_NAME>, on the left <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Right: visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland, the cervical vascular sheath, hypoglossal nerve, accessorius nerve and vagus nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Then removal of the neck preparations IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Then release of the submandibular gland and evacuation of neck levels Ia and b. Several enlarged lymph nodes are seen in all levels, but none of them are macroscopically suspicious. Left: Visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the digastric muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular muscle. Exposure of the accessorius and hypoglossal nerves. Now exposure and dissection of the internal jugular vein. Clearing out the neck levels I-Va while sparing the plexus branches. Here too, several enlarged lymph nodes, but none of them macroscopically suspicious. Now turn to the larynx. The larynx is released on both sides. To do this, the hyoid bone is removed, releasing the infrahyoid muscles, which are beaten downwards. Then place the oblique laryngeal muscles and release the upper thyroid cartilage horn. Then release the piriform sinus and the thyroid cartilage on both sides. Be more careful on the left side due to possible tumor infiltration through the pharyngeal wall. Then enter with the Kleinsasser tube and inspect the localization of the tumour again. Then incision of the pharynx above the tumor 2 cm safety margin. Opening of the pharynx. This shows that there are 2 separate tumors. One on the lateral pharyngeal wall, which is 1.5 cm in size with a central ulcer, this ulcer runs through the entire pharyngeal wall. Then medially, a superficial tumor affecting the mucosa on the arytenoid cartilage and in the medial area of the piriform sinus. Both tumors are next to each other, but have healthy mucosa in between. However, they are so close together that both are resected in one block. Then marginal samples are taken and the specimen is sent to the pathology department on cork. All margin samples are R0 in the frozen section, without carcinoma in situ. Now perform the laryngectomy. Proceed from caudal to ventral. Deposition of the larynx at the cricoid cartilage, then dissection along the cricoid cartilage and the entire laryngeal skeleton in a cranial direction so that the larynx is completely released with maximum mucosal preservation. Removal of the vocal folds for the research laboratory and sending the laryngeal preparation for pathology. The base of the tongue was then released and the dorso-lateral left myotomy performed. Prior to this, a Provox Vega prosthesis was inserted in the usual manner. Then three-layer pharyngeal suture by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, insertion of 2 Redon drains and return to the mouth. The defect on the underside of the tongue is covered with split skin. The split skin comes from the right thigh. Stitch incisions are made through the split skin and sutures are applied. At the end, a compress is sutured and the entire procedure is completed without complications. Please present the patient to the tumor conference to plan radiotherapy.

CT showed no evidence of infiltration of the thyroid cartilage in the anterior commissure area. Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery was indicated.","First of all, MLE once again: positioning of the tumor. This sits broadly in the area of the anterior vocal fold, sits broadly in the area of the anterior commissure, extends subglottically and extends almost to the middle of the vocal fold on the right, but here superficially. Tumor also extends anteriorly somewhat to the supraglottic and left anterior transition towards the ventriculus laryngis. However, the free mucosal margin is still clearly visible. The next step is laser resection with a 4 watt pulsed laser; the tumor is removed in several fractions. Complete resection of the left vocal fold up to the arytenoid cartilage is performed, including the subglottic slope up to the cricoid cartilage as well as the laryngeal ventricle and parts of the left pouch ligament at the front. The supraglottic area is also resected in the front. Resection extends to the right, here the anterior part of the vocal fold is resected according to the real superficial extent of the tumor. In the anterior area, extending to the right and left, the thyroid cartilage is exposed from the supraglottic area down to the cricoid cartilage. Cartilage areas macroscopically free. Removal of the soft tissue is possible without visible tumor contact. Marginal samples are now taken from the subglottic area, from the cricothyroid membrane area and from the anterior commissure area. A marginal sample is also taken from the entire surface of the right vocal cord. In addition, a left dorsal marginal sample from the arytenoid region, left caudal, left cranial and left basal. In the frozen section, except for the left dorsal margin sample, in which carcinomas are still detectable in situ, all margin samples are healthy. Therefore, the resection in the arytenoid region is now carried out again with the laser, including parts of the anterior arytenoid cartilage. In addition, a strip of mucosa from the entire posterior area is sent in again as a marginal sample for the frozen section. No more infiltrates detectable here. Thus R0 resection status. Careful hemostasis is performed with supratabs and monopolar. No bleeding at the final inspection. Completion of the procedure without complications. Overall extensive laser resection of a cT2 carcinoma. The thyroid cartilage and cricoid cartilage are exposed anteriorly and laterally, more on the left than on the right, as is the cricothyroid membrane. For this reason, the patient was given Sobelin intraoperatively. Antibiotics should be continued for about 1 week. Postoperatively, due to the extent of the tumor and after laser resection, control MLE is essential after 10 to 12 weeks.","Laser resection of laryngeal carcinoma

In the tumor follow-up, CT imaging reveals a flat contrast agent image on the left edge of the tongue. The patient suffers from postradiogenic esophageal stenosis and laryngeal stenosis and is permanently tracheostomized. Based on the findings, the above-mentioned operation is indicated. Preoperatively, a sample was taken from the suspected tumor area on the left edge of the tongue. This revealed a squamous cell carcinoma.","Transferring the patient to the operating theater. Carrying out the team time-out with the anesthesia colleagues and induction of intubation anesthesia by the colleagues. Induction of anesthesia through the existing tracheostoma. Now attempt panendoscopy. The patient is extremely difficult to view with the small bore tube due to the severe postradiogenic changes. No abnormalities in the hypopharynx and supraglottic larynx as far as can be assessed. The glottis cannot be adequately assessed, nor can the esophageal opening. A flexible gastroesophagoscopy is not performed as the mucosa is very vulnerable to contact and the lumen is very narrow. Closer inspection with the small flexible scope reveals an almost obliterated esophageal lumen. The placement of a nasogastric tube is also frustrating after several attempts. The tumor is now resected at the edge of the tongue on the left side with a safety margin of approx. 1 cm. Removal of the specimen under constant blood control using bipolar coagulation forceps and palpatory control. Now mark the suture and send the specimen for frozen section examination. After receipt of the frozen section findings, it is found that there is still carcinoma forming the margin in the specimen in the area of the posterior and medial margin (up to the central specimen). The decision is now made to perform a resection. The resection is performed from posterior to mid-medial and the specimen is again sent in thread-marked for histological frozen section examination. The 2nd frozen section is now reliably tumor-free. In summary, an R0 resection can therefore be assumed. Subtle hemostasis using bipolar coagulation forceps and completion of the procedure without complications. Finally, inspection of the fistula at the upper lateral edge of the tracheostoma on the left side. This shows a fistula channel approx. 2-3 mm wide, which is sharpened with the curette after obtaining a sample biopsy and a granulation-promoting dressing material is inserted.

Then diaphanoscopy in the area of the stomach on the left in the area of the left costal arch and then percutaneous puncture and then placement of the trocar and a PEG tube is placed via this in a typical manner using the thread pull-through method. A gastric tube is then placed. Now form an apron flap. This is lifted at the level of the hyoid bone and fixed in place. A neck dissection is then performed on the right. Expose the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath (common carotid artery, jugular vein, vagus nerve). Caudal of the neck dissection preparation is now dissected cranially for approx. 2 cm. The accessorius nerve is now exposed cranially. The digastric muscle and the hypoglossal nerve are overlaid by a large metastasis, which is carefully removed from the surrounding connective tissue and the jugular tissue. The hypoglossal nerve is then safely identified. The lateral neck dissection specimen is now developed and removed from cranial to caudal while protecting the cervical nerve plexus as much as possible. Now the medial part of the common carotid artery is exposed and the bifurcation is sought out and the external carotid artery is traced further. Identification of the superior thyroid artery.

The neck dissection is now completed medially and the common carotid artery is shown. The carotid bifurcation is identified. The external carotid artery is further traced with the superior thyroid artery clamped, severed and ligated. The hyoid bone is then sought out and freed from surrounding connective and fatty tissue. The prelaryngeal muscles (sternohyoid and thyrohyoid muscles) are dissected ventrally up to the level of the supraclavicular region. The hyoid bone is then removed in toto. The posterior horn of the thyroid cartilage is then identified. Identification of the vascular nerve bundle (superior laryngeal artery and the vein accompanying the superior laryngeal nerve) are identified on both sides, clamped, severed and ligated. The hypopharynx is then bluntly released from the thyroid cartilage on both sides. The larynx is then mobilized laterally. The tracheotomy is now performed. Identification of the thyroid isthmus. Clamp it and stop it. The trachea is incised transversely at the level of the 3rd/4th tracheal cartilage and the trachea is fixed caudally to the skin. Now enter the pharyngeal tube. Identification of the epiglottis, which is dislocated. This reveals the tumorous infiltration described above. The larynx is now incised along the aryepiglottic fold on the right and left. The two incisions are now joined below the arytenoid region. Now develop the hypopharyngeal tube and tilt the larynx ventrally. The trachea is then cut out cranially in the form of a tongue. Careful hemostasis is then performed. Samples are taken from the edges for frozen section diagnosis (circular incision around the defect and marking of the defect). The frozen section diagnosis does not reveal any evidence of carcinoma infiltration, so that an R0 situation can be assumed in the present case. Placement of TachoComp, followed by suturing of the muscle layer above the pharyngeal tube. The prelaryngeal musculature is readapted. Subsequent careful irrigation of the wound. Placement of Redon drains. Subcutaneous suture. Skin suture. Suturing of the tracheostoma. It is now apparent that there is probably a dermal nevus on the right supraclavicular side, which is incised and sent for histopathological processing. A tracheostomy tube was then placed. The patient is then admitted to the intensive care unit postoperatively. F a c i t : Laryngectomy, neck dissection on both sides for cT3 laryngeal carcinoma on the right. After receiving the histology, the patient should be presented to the interdisciplinary tumor conference for evaluation of postoperative radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy.","Laryngectomy, PEG, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy

No evidence of malignancy here, only leukoplakia. Then, with progression of the mass, new sampling and panendoscopy <2014>, therefore indication for tumor resection. The tumor is now clearly progressive.","Induction of anesthesia and intubation by anesthesia colleagues. Performing flexible oesophagoscopy and gastroscopy and inserting a PEG using the thread pull-through method. This can be done without any problems with good diaphanoscopy. Insertion of a covered retractor and looping of the tongue. Inspection of the tumor. A tumor at least 4 cm in size can be seen on the middle third of the tongue margin. The tumor extends to the floor of the mouth, but does not involve the anterior floor of the mouth or the base of the tongue. Incision of the mucosa using a monopolar needle with a safety margin of 1 to 1.5 cm. Removal of the tumor using scissors, bipolar forceps and palpation. The tumor penetrates deep down to the midline of the tongue. The tumor can be removed in its entirety. The tumor preparation is thread-marked in its entirety for frozen section. This is clearly an R0 situation. Due to the large resulting defect, the decision was made to cover the defect with a radialis graft to improve function. Therefore neck dissection on the left side. Neck dissection on the right side is not performed due to the lack of infiltration of the base of the tongue and anterior floor of the mouth and a cN0 neck status on the right side. Transverse neck incision. Exposure of the platysma. Formation of a cranial and caudal platysma flap.

Release of the neck preparation Leves II a/b as well as III, IV and V, while sparing the plexus branches. Level V is integrated into the neck preparation, as some lymph nodes could be found here. Release of the submandibular gland and removal of fatty tissue in level I b. Dissection of the digastric muscle and formation of an enoral tunnel. Lifting the radialis graft. Drawing of the radial artery. Marking of the graft. Cutting around the graft. Incision of the skin up to the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the venous star in the antecubital fossa with basilic vein, cephalic vein and the confluence between the superficial and deep venous system. Exposure of the superficial ramus, the radial nerve with its splitting. This can be completely preserved. Exposure of the radial artery. Ligating and separating the radial artery.

The histology revealed a p16 positive oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left, which is why the above-mentioned procedure was indicated. Clinically, there is still a scarred and partially suspicious area in the area of the oropharynx and it cannot be guaranteed that the entire tumor was removed during the generous biopsy. Hence the indication for resection.","Transfer of the patient to the operating room. Active patient identification. Introductory consultation with anesthesia colleagues.

Entering the esophagus with the flexible instrument. Identification of the anterior wall of the stomach. Perform a positive diaphanoscopy. Now insertion of the PEG tube in the usual manner using the thread pull-through method without complications. Repositioning of the patient in a slight head reclination position. Then insertion of the tonsillectomy tube and re-inspection of the region. As described above, a scarred area was found. Then insertion of the DaVinci retractor and introduction of the robotic arms and the camera. The scarred area is now removed superficially in one piece using the robot. Suspicious mucosal tissue is still visible at the caudal edge, which is why a second resection is performed here. The resectate and the complete resectate are thread-marked for the frozen section. All margins free in the frozen section. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection. Inject Supra into both sides of the neck in the course of the skin incision.

Dissection along the sternocleidomastoid muscle in depth. Identification of the digastric muscle and the accessorius nerve. Freeing the digastric muscle from the surrounding lymph node tissue. Identification of the submandibular gland. Sharp dissection along the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial and mobilization of the neck preparation. This allows the carotid artery and vagus nerve to be safely protected. Safe protection of the hypoglossal nerve. Detachment of the neck preparation from cranial to caudal in the usual manner without damaging the nerve/vascular structures. Followed by wound irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer.

Computed tomographic transglottic carcinoma with clear erosion of the thyroid cartilage and here cN0 neck status. Sonographic evidence of cN1 neck status with conspicuous lymph nodes in level Ib on the left side. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure with laryngectomy was recommended. There is a history of partial parotidectomy on the right in 1965.","After bronchoscopic intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, positioning of the patient. Entry with the small bore tube under dental protection and inspection of the primary tumor region. The oral cavity and oropharynx are unremarkable. Likewise the hypopharynx with inconspicuous postcricoid region and free piriform sinus as well as free esophageal entrance. There is now a tumorous protrusion in the endolaryngeal region, especially on the right anterior side, with a barely adjustable glottic plane. In conjunction with CT imaging, confirmation of the initially described extent and indication for laryngectomy. Placement of a nasogastric feeding tube. Incision and elevation of a broad-based apron flap. This reveals extensive subcutaneous scarring on the right side, with a history of parotidectomy, which extends to the entire neck area. The neck dissection is now initially performed as a revision of the right side. Release of the markedly scarred sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland and exposure of the digastric muscle, which is also scarred. A long scarred cervical vascular sheath can also be seen. Removal of the anterior neck preparation and preservation of the external carotid arteries and the hypoglossal nerve. Initial exposure of the facial vein. This is later removed for tumor resection. Exposure of the upper pole of the thyroid gland on the right side. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein with careful removal of scars. Towards the lateral neck preparation, regular tissue is visible again. Careful exposure of the cervical plexus and clearing to level Va. Significant cranial scarring again. Despite careful visualization and preparation, the accessorius nerve cannot be visualized and was presumably resected during the previous operation. Later, the upper horn of the thyroid cartilage and the hyoid are visualized. Significant scarring here as well, questionable after radiotherapy or more extensive previous surgery than can be determined from the history. Careful lateral release of the thyroid cartilage and release of the piriform sinus. Anterior exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea and lateral dissection of half of the thyroid gland. Turn to the opposite side. No preliminary treatment here. Exposure and preservation of the external vein and auricularis magnus. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland and visualization of the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the V. facialis, A. thyroidea superior, N. hypoglossus and Ansa cervicalis. Tracing of the thyroid vessels and also dissection of the left thyroid lobe. Dissection of the left lobe of the thyroid gland. Dissection of the internal jugular vein after exposure of the accessorius nerve. After free dissection of the cervical vascular sheath, exposing the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve, completion in the direction of level V, with careful protection and preservation of the cervical plexus branches. Finally, in the case of sonographically conspicuous findings, exploration and evacuation of level Ib. To do this, release the submandibular gland. Cranial dissection of the nerve-conducting connective tissue. Careful exploration. Removal of the facial lymph nodes. Careful exploration. There are no suspicious changes here. Lymph nodes are also found dorsally and anteriorly to the gland. No further measures after final palpation. Finally, if the wound is dry, expose the thyroid cartilage horn on the left side. Finally, removal of the upper laryngeal bundle. Release of the piriform sinus and now detachment of the infrahyoid musculature. Here, the larynx appears to be coarsely widened, especially on the right side, and when the infrahyoid muscles are lifted, they are compressed and there is a questionable tumor breakthrough. It was therefore decided to leave the infrahyoid muscles completely on the laryngeal skeleton. Even if the relationship between the thyroid and hyoid is unclear, the hyoid should be removed and the soft tissue detached en bloc. Enter the pharynx in the area of the vallecula. Exposure of the epiglottis. Extension of the resection to protect the mucosa. As described above, there is no growth extending beyond the larynx in the area of the mucosal level. Careful release of the piriform sinus. Postcricoid release. Now a good overview of the tumor, which extends in the area of the larynx, especially on the right side, towards the thyroid cartilage, partly also towards the pre-epiglottic space and here, at least palpatorily, there is a suspicion of a thyroid cartilage rupture. Entry into the trachea and intubation. Removal of the first tracheal ring, creating a dorsally elevated trachea. The preparation now shows wide resection margins in relation to the mucosal level, with only a narrow area in the region of the raised infrahyoid musculature when the trachea breaks through. Therefore, an edge sample is taken at the situs, at the closest distance to the infrahyoid musculature left here. The frozen section shows this to be tumor-free, so that an R0 situation can be assumed here. A size 10 Provox prosthesis is now placed, with cranial puncture of the trachea and placement of the Provox voice prosthesis using the usual pull-through method. Finally, good positioning. Sparing right lateral myotomy in otherwise wide conditions and already visible reflux. No further measures in the area of the upper esophageal sphincter. Separation of the sternal insertions of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and subsequent careful two-layer pharyngeal closure. Careful wound inspection. If the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Careful two-layer wound closure with incision of the tracheostoma. Subsequent reintubation to a size 10 low-cuff cannula. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT4a transglottic laryngeal carcinoma with right emphasis. Please continue antibiotics for 24 hours with Unacid 3 g. Perform an X-ray pre-swallow on the 8th to 10th postoperative day. Please present at our interdisciplinary tumor conference. Determination of any pre-irradiation carried out in the case of conspicuously extensive scarring on the right cervical side.","Laryngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Provox Voice Prosthesis

Performing transoral tumor resection with the CO2 laser. The resection margins extend from the roof of the pocket fold on the right side to the level of the pocket fold on the left side, completely eliminating the epiglottis. Removal of representative marginal samples. These are sent in for a frozen section and are found intraoperatively in such a way that the tumor border to the healthy tissue is less than 1 mm in the right side. Therefore, in the case of close in sano resection, a further resection is performed in the area of the right settling area in the area of the pocket crease as well as dorsally and also on the dorsal left side. These marginal samples are sent in again for frozen section and are still assessed intraoperatively as all tumor-free. Subtle hemostasis. Removal of the bulb. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection on both sides: start with the neck dissection on the right side. If a lymph node metastasis has been removed, slight scarring here, therefore more difficult preparation conditions. Carry out neck dissection levels I b to V. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and the accessorius, vagus and hypoglossal nerves. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve, vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. The resection is performed while preserving all branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery. In the area of the venous angle, where the metastasis had initially been removed in a first procedure, further lymph node conglomerates are visible. Enlarged lymph nodes can also be seen in levels II and III. All levels are completely removed. Subsequent subtle hemostasis. Insertion of a Redon drain. Multi-layer wound closure. Transition to the left side. Identical procedure here. Here, too, long exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the vagus nerve, accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Here too, the resection ranges from level I b to level V. Preservation of all vascular structures. The extent of the resection is identical to the opposite side. Subtle hemostasis. Insertion of a Redon drainage. Multi-layer wound closure. Performing the tracheotomy. Modified Kocher incision. Exposure and separation of the pretracheal musculature. Opening in the midline. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. After this has been carefully coagulated, cut through it. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Performing the tracheotomy between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp. Preparation of a Björk flap. Circular suturing of the tracheostoma and insertion of a size 8 tracheostomy tube. Further ventilation via the tracheostomy tube as the operation progresses. Insertion of the flexible endoscope into the stomach.

Inspection of the hypopharynx on the left side with the size C small bore tube. The tumor described above is unchanged in size, which predominantly extends to the lateral wall of the hypopharynx and slightly to the piriform sinus wall. Otherwise there is no tumor. The medial piriform sinus wall is certainly not affected by the tumor. Removal of all instruments. Repositioning of the patient for tumor resection. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Incision with cutting around a platysmal flap. Dissection of the platysma and the platysmal flap. A large lymph node conglomerate can be seen laterally and on the vein, which extends to the vein angle. This is dissected down from the vein. The cranial part shows that the vein is clearly infiltrated by the tumor, which is why the decision is made to resect the vein. Therefore, long dissection of the vagus nerve and the carotid artery. Exposure of the internal jugular vein at the base of the skull. Ligation of the internal jugular vein at the base of the skull and detachment of the vein. This also releases the large lymph node conglomerate. Subsequent removal of levels I b, II, III, IV and V. It can also be seen that the caudal part of the accessorius nerve is infiltrated by lymph node metastases as it passes through to the trapezius muscle. Resection of the nerve here as well. The nerve is preserved in the cranial part in the innervation area of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Long-term dissection of the nerve here. Displacement and re-embedding at the end of the operation in the sense of neurolysis. Preservation of the plexus branches during dissection. Release of the larynx. Release of the pharynx. Resection of the lateral part of the thyroid cartilage. This provides a good view of the pharynx. Separation of the constrictor pharyngis. Opening of the pharynx lateral and caudal to the tumor. From here, under good visibility, cut around the tumor with a macroscopically sufficient safety margin. Remove frozen sections after assessing the specimen. These are still declared tumor-free intraoperatively. Therefore pharyngeal suture with single button sutures. Closure of the constrictor pharyngeal muscle with continuous sutures. As the pharynx could be closed with local mucosa without tension, suturing of the platysmal flap was not necessary. Repositioning of the platysmal flap. Multi-layer wound closure.

Furthermore, there is a post-operative laser resection of a carcinoma in situ of the left arytenoid region with neck dissection in 2006, which is why the above-mentioned procedure is indicated.","Initially beginning with a pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy. An exophytic mass is seen, starting at the pharyngo-epiglottic fold, which extends to the left arytenoid, infiltrates the entrance of the left piriform sinus and extends to the opposite side in the postcricoid region. Now imaging with narrow-band imaging and confirmation that laser resection is not possible here, even after consulting the CT findings. Then enter with the flexible oesophagoscope and pre-scan into the stomach. Here, conditions were unremarkable on all sides. Now perform the PEG insertion using the thread pull-through method with good diaphanoscopy. Then sterile washing and draping. Create an apron flap in the usual manner. Start with neck dissection on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle of the submandibular gland. Then clearing of the neck levels IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches and sparing the hypoglossal nerve and the accessorius nerve. Unfortunately, the lingual artery and the superior thyroid artery must be removed. Level IV shows a high-lying thoracic duct. This is partially injured during neck level removal and chyle flow occurs. In this case, the duct with the vein opening is cut off and covered with Tachosil. This is performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Then turn to the opposite side and neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Clearing of the neck level while sparing the plexus branches of the hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. The cervical vascular sheath was exposed and spared on both sides. The lingual artery can remain on the right side, but unfortunately the right superior thyroid artery must also be removed. The facial artery and ascending pharyngeal artery are still present on both sides and would theoretically still be available for a free flap transplant. Now release the hyoid bone and release the larynx by detaching the cervical vascular sheath and the thyroid gland from the larynx. Separation of the infrahyoid muscles and entry into the pharynx from the right side. Disluxation of the epiglottis and inspection of the tumor, which is as described above. Mucosal changes extend along the left hypopharyngeal side wall into the base of the tongue. Now incision of the mucosa at the edge of the epiglottis up to the postcricoid region and removal of the larynx, taking a large part of the pharynx on the left side with it. Initially, only a very narrow mucosal strip of the posterior wall of the hypopharynx remains. The esophageal opening itself is free and does not need to be resected. Marginal samples are taken. Here, extensive carcinoma in situ with partial transition to a microinvasive carcinoma can still be seen, particularly in the area of the left hypopharynx. Therefore, a resection must be performed here. Due to the resection, a complete pharyngectomy is performed in the caudal region. Extensive carcinoma in situ with partial microinvasion in the resected area. Therefore, further resection so that only a small amount of mucosa remains in the cranial and middle area of the hypopharynx and a transplant must be inserted in any case. After consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the decision is made to use a pectoralis major graft. A pro vox prosthesis is not inserted, even after consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, as the pharyngeal reconstruction must be carried out completely with the pectoralis graft and there is no longer any mucous membrane capable of vibrating. Now lift the pectoralis major graft. To do this, measure the defect and lift and mark the graft 10 x 12 cm. A bridge is constructed in the area of the deltopectoral flap. The pectoralis major graft is lifted from the thoracic wall. Holding sutures are inserted and the graft is released, leaving the pedicle in place, and pulled upwards under the bridge. Mucosal sutures are then placed in the area of the esophageal inlet and also in the area of the base of the tongue and the cranial hypopharyngeal descending edge. The graft is then pulled in secondarily over the inserted sutures and knotted in place. The remaining parts of the remaining mucosa are connected to the graft to create a neopharynx through a tubed pectoralis major flap. A nasogastric tube was previously inserted for splinting. The stalk of the pectoralis major flap is positioned exactly on the chyle fistula so that it is also covered. Insertion of 3 redone drains in the thoracic region and one redone drain in each neck region. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue postoperative antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Please provide fat-free nutrition with periamine for 3 days. Due to the size of the defect and the very large graft incision, there is a high risk of fistula, also because the pectoralis major flap is very large and has the lowest blood supply in the cranial area. If there is a risk of fistula, please open the neck and irrigate at an early stage. Otherwise, if there is no risk of fistula, take an X-ray vomit on the 12th postoperative day and carefully build up a diet. The patient must be presented to the tumor conference for planning of postoperative radiochemotherapy.","Laryngectomy, Caudal pharyngectomy, Modified radical neck dissection, Permanent tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Pedicled flap (Pectoralis major)

Sonography revealed a fluid-filled cystic mass with suspicious sonomorphology. Therefore, <2017> an unremarkable panendoscopy and a lymph node extirpation in level II on the left was performed. Histologically, this revealed a p16 positive lymph node metastasis of a squamous cell carcinoma, and the subsequent PET-CT showed a suspicious accumulation of contrast medium in the area of the left tonsil. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about this before the operation.","Initial head positioning by the surgeon. Insertion of the McIVOR oral spatula and adjustment of the left tonsil tube. Macroscopically inconspicuous .............. Tonsil, in particular no evidence of growth of the suspected carcinoma beyond the tonsil on inspection. Marking of the resection margins in the area of the anterior and posterior palatal arch using a monopolar needle. Tumor tonsillectomy is then performed using the dissection technique, including a muscle margin of the palatoglossal arch and parts of the anterior and posterior palatal arch and the base of the tongue in the area of the lower pole. The tonsil is extirpated in toto and sent to the frozen section marked with a suture. The diagnosis of a squamous cell carcinoma resected in sano, but only just R0 towards the base of the wound. In the meantime, head repositioning for neck dissection on the left. After lymph node extirpation in level II on the left, approx. 1.5 transverse fingers wide and thus relatively far superior, a horizontal scar is seen. An attempt is initially made to integrate this into the course of the neck dissection, but this is too close to the lower jaw and would also result in a cosmetically unfavorable, very anterior course of the further incision. It was therefore decided to make a new incision in this area, far posterior to the posterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Injection of a total of 8 ml xylocaine with added adrenaline. Skin disinfection and sterile draping. Skin incision down to the platysma. Exposure and ligation of the external jugular vein. Subsequent dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve. Caudal dissection and exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Superiorly, the digaster muscle is exposed through the scar tissue and dissected about halfway anteriorly. Condition after previous operation, difficult conditions. Now dissect the vascular nerve sheath. The neck dissect is dissected in one piece up to level IIa, set down cranially in level IIa, cut caudally under the accessorius nerve. The cervical anus is then located and dissected from inferior to superior and laterally, with successive clean dissection of the neck dissectate from the scalene musculature while protecting the anus. This is successful without any problems. Now caudally, at the end of level IV, separation of the neck dissectate after bipolar coagulation and ligation. Now, after anterior dissection of the outlet of the facial vein and the angle between the facial vein and the internal jugular vein. Dissection of a further lymph node and a small amount of fatty tissue. Subsequent wound irrigation and meticulous hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. There is no evidence of residual fatty tissue or lymphatic tissue in the surgical area. Therefore, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and two-layer wound closure in the typical manner. Head repositioning in the reclination position and insertion of the McIVOR oral spatula. Adjustment of the left tonsil lodge and removal of a total of five marginal samples, which are sent for frozen section. Minute hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. By <CLINICIAN_NAME>, prophylactic caudal and lateral repositioning in the tonsil bed. All marginal samples were found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleagues. Thus repeated inspection. Dry conditions. Removal of the inserted ball swab. Insertion of a nasogastric feeding tube, under visualization in the typical manner.

Now tongue base carcinoma, histologically squamous cell carcinoma on the left, extending to the midline. Second tumor after radiotherapy in childhood. Therefore above mentioned surgery indicated.","First, pharyngoscopy/laryngoscopy again and confirmation of the extent. The tumor is located in the base of the tongue on the left, reaching at least to the midline. The tumor extends to the glossotonsillar groove or the tonsil. This confirms the indication for surgery with flap coverage. First PEG placement: insertion of the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach. There, after creating the diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm stomach wall tube without complications. Sterile dressing. Subsequent repositioning for tumor resection and flap covering: First skin disinfection and injection of a total of 15 ml Ultracaine with adrenaline into the area of the planned apron flap and sterile covering of all surgical areas. Start with dissection of the apron flap: This is performed via the typical skin incision and by elevating the tissue subplatysmal to the level of the hyoid bone or submandibular gland. Subsequent neck dissection on the left: Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, digastric muscle and omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the infrahyoid muscles. Depiction of the common, internal and external carotid artery, internal jugular vein and facial vein. An external jugular vein is only very thin and is coagulated. The auricular nerve is exposed and preserved. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, cervical nerve and accessorius nerve. Clearing level II to V a, with preservation of the cervical plexus. Subsequent combined tumor resection: start transorally. Tumor is palpated. Cut around the tumor with a distance of at least 1.5 cm on all sides. Resection extends beyond the midline. Resection includes the floor of the mouth, the lingual nerve is initially exposed, but must be resected later due to its proximity to the tumor. Mucosa is resected up to the alveolar ridge along the glossoalveolar groove. Lower parts of the tonsil are resected together with parts of the caudal palatal arch. Counter-operation from the transcervical side to resect the tumor in the base of the tongue while sparing the lingualis on the opposite side. Resection is performed with exposure of the lingual artery on the right side. Resection is performed in the vallecula to the left, taking the mucosa of the lingual epiglottis with it. Resection extends to the piriform sinus entrance. Cranially again up to the lower part of the palatal arch. The specimen is removed and thread-marked. An additional marginal sample is taken from the glossotonsillar groove from the floor of the mouth to the alveolar ridge to the lower edge of the tonsil. This is also thread-marked for the frozen section. In the frozen section, the tumor is basically removed on all sides in healthy tissue, but slightly higher-grade, approximately medium-grade dysplasia caudally in the direction of the vallecula, higher-grade dysplasia cannot be ruled out with certainty. Therefore resection is recommended again. An approx. 1 cm wide strip is resected, including the lateral parts of the epiglottis, the entrance of the piriform sinus up to the posterior pharyngeal wall. This goes to the frozen section marked with a thread remote from the tumor. Confirmation that this marginal sample is tumor-free at the markings remote from the tumor. Thus overall R0 resection with regard to the primary. There is now a defect in the area of the vallecula and pharyngeal side wall up to the tonsil lobe as well as in the floor of the mouth and in particular in the body and base of the tongue. Radial flap is planned after measuring the required three-dimensional dimensions. Neck dissection on the right: This neck dissection is performed in the same way as on the left side. Here too, clearing of levels II to V a. Then tracheotomy: After cutting through the thyroid isthmus and supplying it with puncture ligatures, visualization of the trachea. Entry into the trachea and creation of a broadly pedicled, visor-like, modified Björk flap. This is initially epithelized caudally. Insertion of a laryngectomy tube. Now remove the radial flap from the left forearm: mark the flap in the required three-dimensional size. Maximum length 11 cm, maximum width 7 ˝ cm. First cut around the flap ulnarly and lift subfascially. Then extend the incision into the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the superficial venous system. Only obliterated residual veins are visible here, with an insignificant volume, but still connected to the deep venous system. Visualization of the vascular pedicle. This shows a larger radial vein after confluence. Now first elevation of the superficial venous system from subfascial. Dissection of the radialis flap now from the radial side and elevation from the radial side. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. Caudal exposure of the radial artery. After clamping and sufficient waiting time, always 100% saturation. Deposition of the radial artery. The artery is treated with 4-0 Prolene stitches. Lift the radial artery flap with the pedicle subfascially along the course of the pedicle. Outgoing, smaller vessels are clipped or treated with bipolar coagulation. In the antecubital fossa, the relatively small radial artery is exposed as far as the entrance to the brachial artery. The confluence can be followed a little further into the antecubital fossa. The flap is then removed. The small, rudimentary cephalic veins are also removed and ligated proximally. The relatively thin radial artery is supplied twice using a clip. The confluent radial vein is ligated after removal. Flush the flap with heparin solution. Subsequent insertion of the flap. This is generally very difficult due to the very narrow mouth opening. The flap is successively worked into the defect with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures according to the preforming. Difficult suturing due to the limited space available. Finally, the flap is sutured in all dimensions sufficiently. Tension-free, complete closure. The stalk is carried forward into the left side of the neck. The connecting vessels are then shown here. The superior artery and the facial vein are selected first. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery and the radial artery. Suture with 9-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, initially very good blood flow and good venous return. Insufficient pulsation in the course, possible vascular spasm or thrombosis. Therefore opening of the superior thyroid artery. No blood flow recognizable here, even after dilatation. Either spasm or thrombosis near the outlet. Closure of the superior thyroid artery with clips, as was previously done in the distal area of this artery. Additional ligation. Subsequent exploration of the linguofacial trunk. The facial artery, which was previously preserved, is already thrombosed. Overall, the relatively poor vascular status after chemotherapy was confirmed. The lingual artery can be visualized, the ligature is removed and the artery is shortened. Afterwards, there is good blood flow from this artery. Therefore, the radial artery is now reapproximated to the lingual artery. This is done with 9-0 Ethilon single button sutures. Again, good arterial flow and also good venous return. Therefore, the veins are now conditioned. The facial vein is conditioned with confluence of the radial vein. Selection of a coupler size 2.5 and anastomosis of the veins without any problems. Good venous return. Subsequent irrigation of the entire wound area. Careful hemostasis. Successive wound closure with insertion of a flap on the left and a Redon drainage on the right and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Suture marking in the area of the vascular pedicle for sonographic Doppler control. The flap is then checked again. This shows that there is no blood flow after the puncture. This means that there is again insufficient perfusion via the arterial vessel. The wound must therefore be reopened on the left side. Visualization of the pedicle. Here, too, there is no longer any continuous pulsation, which means that there is another thrombosis. Opening of the artery. No sufficient blood flow recognizable here, similar to the superior thyroid artery previously. Thus, again suspected thrombosis or vasospasm. Even after dilatation, there is no longer sufficient blood flow from this vessel. The flap is flushed with heparin solution until it comes out of the venous vascular system and is recognizable again. Shortening of the vessel in the area of the linguofacial trunk. Very good blood flow here again. The radial artery is dissected like a fish mouth and anastomosed again with the now significantly larger lumen using 9-0 Ethilon single button sutures. Again, after opening the clamp, good blood flow, good venous return. Now follow the perfusion for approx. 1 hour. Here finally permanent arterial pulsation, which also provides signals with the Doppler, in contrast to the previous anastomoses. Puncture of the flap shows good perfusion. This time the anastomosis appears to remain permanently open. Therefore, wound irrigation, careful hemostasis and closure, with insertion of a new flap on the left side. Suturing of the cannula. Flap check again after skin closure. Now good blood circulation. Insertion of a 7 mm tracheostomy tube. The forearm was closed with a split-thickness skin graft taken from the right thigh. A 0.7 mm thick split-thickness skin graft was first removed from the right thigh. Hydrogel or hydrocholoid dressing is then applied here. The arm is then primarily closed in the proximal area and the split skin is successively incorporated into the defect in the area of the forearm. Care is taken to protect the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve of the median nerve and also to protect the ulnar artery. Octenidine-Mepilex dressing is then applied. Loose compresses are placed over this and fixed in place with absorbent cotton. Application or adjustment of a Cramer splint and fixation with a bandage. Positioning of the arm. Arm always well perfused with 100% saturation until the end of the procedure. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Heparin perfusor 500 units/hour must be continued postoperatively. Additionally aspirin 50 mg i.v., please repeat this the next day. Flap check every ˝ hour for the first 1 to 2 days, then according to the schedule for a total of 5 days. Antibiotics given intraoperatively should be continued for 1 week with Unacid. Nutrition via the inserted PEG tube. On the 12th day, approx. gruel swallow and then, depending on the gruel swallow or swallowing function, diet build-up or initiation of swallowing rehabilitation. Overall, in the case of radiochemotherapy for rhabdomyosarcoma, difficult situation with regard to the arterial anastomosis. Overall tongue base tumor cT2 to 3, defect coverage by radial flap. Please present at the interdisciplinary tumor conference after receiving the final histology.","Laryngectomy, Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

A decision to resect the tumor is discussed and determined in our interdisciplinary tumor conference <2014 Now indication for the above-mentioned operation.","First, the anesthesia colleague induces anesthesia and performs a rigid tracheobronchoscopy with 0° optics. The glottis, subglottis and trachea up to the entrance of the main bronchi show normal mucosal conditions, with no evidence of suspicious masses. After removal of the optics, intubation by the 1st surgeon. Flexible gastroesophagoscopy is then performed. The gastroscope is carefully advanced into the stomach under constant air insufflation. The stomach is then inspected and the mucosa is found to be normal in all areas, from the cardia to the pylorus. Then carefully withdraw the flexible gastroscope and inspect the esophagus from caudal to cranial, linea serrata and gastroesophageal junction 43 cm from the upper row of teeth. Caudal and middle part of the esophagus show slightly chronically altered mucosal conditions. Cranial ............................. of the esophagus are completely unremarkable. Then remove the flexible gastroscope and perform a direct pharyngoscopy using a size B small bore tube. After placing the mouth guard, carefully inspect the oral cavity and the oral vestibule. A relatively small, ulcer-shaped mass can be seen on the lower surface of the tongue paramedially on the right. On palpation, this grows endophytically into the body of the tongue. Next, inspection of the oropharynx. The soft and hard palate, palatal arches, posterior pharyngeal wall and base of the tongue are unremarkable. Switch to the size C small bore tube and inspect both piriform sinuses as well as the retrocricoidal area and supraglottis. Regular mucosal conditions here, no evidence of secondary malignancy. Removal of the small drainage tube without damaging the tooth and mouth structures. Placement of an oral retractor. The body and tip of the tongue are fixed with a suture and pulled out. The tumor is then exposed and the incision margins are marked at a distance of at least 1 to 1.2 cm from the tumor. After incision of the mucosa, careful suture marking was performed: 1st margin inferior, 3 o'clock long-long, 2nd margin lateral, short-long, 9 o'clock, 3rd margin medial, 9 o'clock, short-short. Then further dissection into the tongue musculature and maintaining the distance to the tumor of at least 1 cm. Careful dissection of the tongue muscles and careful hemostasis using ligatures and electrocoagulation. After removal of the tumor, a thin layer of muscle is removed caudally as a second sample. Both are sent for final histology. Careful hemostasis and securing of the Wharton's duct, which was not injured during the operation. Demonstration to <CLINICIAN_NAME> and discussion of the further procedure. Joint decision on primary wound closure. The wound edges are carefully adapted and the wound is closed primarily. Handover of the patient to the anesthesia colleagues. Completion of the operation without complications. Conclusion: A T1 squamous cell carcinoma of the lower surface of the right tongue is resected and an inconspicuous panendoscopy is performed in the same session without complications. Intraoperatively endophytically growing ulcer, 1 to 1.3 cm in size, which grows at least 3 to 4 mm into the body of the tongue. Resection with a distance of at least 1 cm in all directions. The tissue was sent for final histological analysis. Further procedure after receipt of the final histology. If tumor infiltration is more than 8 mm, a selective right neck dissection should be performed. Please allow soft food from the 2nd postoperative day. Continue antibiotics with clindamycin for the next 3 days.","Resection and Panendoscopy

Intubation transnasally by the anesthetist. Entry with the flexible gastroesophagoscope and endoscopy into the stomach. Inconspicuous conditions on all sides. If diaphanoscopy is good, perform a PEG insertion using the thread pull-through method. Enter with the Kleinsasser tube and inspect the tumor region. There is an exophytic mass in the area of the left piriform sinus on the lateral and anterior wall. The medial and posterior border of the left piriform sinus is not covered by the tumor. The postcricoid and arytenoid region of the larynx is free on both sides. The vocal fold level and the pocket fold level as well as the epiglottis are also not affected by the tumor. It was therefore decided not to perform a complete laryngectomy. Now injection of xylocaine-adrenaline mixture in the throat area. Sterile washing and draping. Creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Start with the neck dissection on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. It becomes clear that the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein cannot be preserved on this side, so switch to the right side. Carry out the neck dissection on the right side to ensure that the internal jugular vein can be preserved here. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. The entire length of the internal jugular vein can be preserved, including the outlet of the facial vein and the facial vein itself. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and the superior thyroid. Release of the medial neck block and then release of the neck block II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. This is successful without any problems. Then transfer to the opposite side and release of the medial neck block with detachment of a 5 x 3 cm metastasis in level II a. This is very difficult as the mass cannot be detached from the jugular vein. This is detached in the area at the border to level III. If the facial vein is very deep, the facial vein itself may remain intact. The sternocleidomastoid muscle must be partially resected and the accessory nerve must also be resected, as it runs directly into the tumor. The metastasis is now successively detached from the internal and external carotid artery. This can be done bluntly with the stalk to ensure that there is no infiltration of these vessels. Finally, the metastasis must also be bluntly detached from the vagus nerve and also from the hypoglossal nerve. Dissection in this area is generally very difficult. Ultimately, the metastasis is successfully detached from the nerves and vessels mentioned above and from the base of the skull. The remaining neck regions are then cleared out while sparing the remaining plexus branches. Entering the pharynx below the hyoid bone from the right side. Inspection of the tumor. This is localized as described above for pharyngoscopy. It is completely incised with a safety margin of 1.5 cm and is marked with a suture for the frozen section. The frozen section shows a complete R0 situation without carcinoma in situ, invasive carcinoma or dysplasia in the marginal area. As there is ultimately sufficient mucosa in the pharyngeal area, the decision is made to perform primary wound closure. This is usually carried out in two layers. As the mucosa is very thin in places and is somewhat under tension in some areas, the thyroid gland and the infrahyal muscles are stitched over the suture area. Finally, two Redon drains are inserted and a two-layer wound closure is performed. A tracheotomy was performed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage before the tumor resection. Creation of a visor tracheotomy without Björk flap. Epithelialization of the tracheal margins with the skin. Insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit in an awake state and should receive 3 days of intravenous antibiotics with Unacid and on the 10th postoperative day an X-ray vomit swallow, then if there is no fistula, removal of the nasogastric tube and implementation of the diet.

Retract the esophagoscope and enter with the small bore tube. Inspection of the oropharynx. This shows the previously described mass at the upper left tonsil pole. Mirroring forward to the posterior pharyngeal wall and hypopharynx. Inconspicuous on all sides. Inspection of the piriform sinus and the entrance to the esophagus as well as the postcricoid region and the arytenoid region. No tumorous masses. Adjustment of the glottic plane and inspection of the vocal folds and pocket folds including the anterior commissure. No abnormalities here. Insertion of the tonsil stop and inspection of the left tonsil lobe. A rough mass can be seen at the upper tonsil pole with transition to the anterior palatal arch. The mucosa is incised with a safety margin using the monopolar needle. Then further preparation with scissors and bipolar forceps. Removal of the tonsil including the mass with a safety margin.

Then inspection of the alveolar ridges. A suspicious change in the mucosa in region III/VII to VIII can be seen on the alveolar ridge on the lower jaw. This is biopsied. Then inspection of the alveolar ridge on the left side of the maxilla. There is actually no suspicious mass here, but as a contrast agent uptake was described in regions II/IV to II/VI on the CT, this region was also biopsied. Hemostasis by insertion of hydrogen swabs and bipolar coagulation. The operation was completed with dry blood, without complications. Conclusion: cT1 cN0 tonsillar carcinoma on the left. Neck dissection on the left side should be planned, if necessary with resection if the marginal samples are not healthy.

Subsequent positioning. First perform flexible esophagogastroscopy. For this, enter with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy visualization of the stomach. The stomach is inconspicuous and clear, as is the oesophagus on reflection. Now enter with the Kleinsasser tube under dental protection after inspection of the inconspicuous oral vestibule. Inspection of the oral cavity, including the floor of the mouth, tongue and soft palate. First inspection of the endolarynx. As described above, this is completely normal and clear, as is the hypopharynx, which can be easily adjusted up to the esophageal inlet and the tips of the piriform sinus. Inspection of the oropharynx. A clear tonsillar hyperplasia on the left with intratonsillar thickening and coarse changes is clearly suspicious, but based on the palpation findings it is more likely to be an intratonsillar tumor than a lymphoma. The rest of the oropharynx is unremarkable and free except for a left-sided circumscribed vallecula cyst. Demonstration of findings also on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequently, in case of cT2 tonsillar carcinoma, perform a right tumor tonsillectomy. For this purpose, incision at the anterior palatal arch with subtotal removal of the anterior palatal arch. Resection of the tonsil, leaving a muscle cuff on the tonsil. Mucosal resection distance of a good 1 cm on all sides.

Conclusion: Intraoperative high-grade suspicion of cT2 cN2a tonsillar carcinoma on the right. If this is confirmed histologically, neck dissection of the right side should be planned for a second time, as well as a CT thorax to complete the staging. If an R-1 situation persists despite further macroscopic in sano resection, a subsequent resection in the basal area with delayed neck dissection must be planned.

The panendoscopy performed in <2016> revealed a mass extending from the hypopharyngeal side wall on the left via the postcricoid region to the esophageal inlet. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.,"Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the hypopharynx and larynx. The tumor begins just below the tonsil lobe on the left side, extends caudally along the hypopharyngeal side wall, infiltrates the piriform sinus completely on the left side, infiltrates the postcricoid region on both sides and continues to grow into the esophageal entrance, infiltrating it caudally for approx. 2 cm. In addition, there is a demarcated oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left side, which exists on the side wall of the oropharynx independently of the hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Positioning of the patient. Sterile washing and draping, after injection and application of an apron flap in the usual manner. Start by releasing the larynx. To do this, the hyoid bone is released, then the infrahyal muscles are detached and the oblique laryngeal muscles are detached. Perform a tracheotomy below the cricoid cartilage and transfer to a laryngectomy tube. Detachment of the thyroid gland from the thyroid cartilage skeleton on both sides. This shows that the thyroid gland on the left side is also infiltrated. It is therefore first partially resected and later completely. The piriform sinus is then released on the right side; this is not possible on the left side. On the left side, it is already clear when the larynx is released that the tumor breaks outwards almost into the soft tissues of the neck. For this reason, a suture marker is placed at a questionable location and a representative sample is taken from the soft tissue, including a marginal sample. The marginal sample was tumor-free in the frozen section. Entering the pharynx from the right side. Disluxation of the epiglottis and resection of the mucosa and tumor with integration of the oropharyngeal carcinoma and resection of the esophageal inlet and removal of the larynx below the cricoid cartilage. The tumor is thread-marked in its entirety in the frozen section. All margins are free of tumor in the frozen section. In the area of the thyroid gland, the safety margin is less than 0.5 cm. Therefore, the tumor is resected again and the remaining thyroid gland is also removed and sent to the frozen section again, also thread-marked. Now everything is tumor-free. Measurement of the defect. The result was an 18 x 8 cm defect. A left lateral esophagomyotomy was performed very carefully and then the esophagus was incised in the middle to create a V-shaped entrance. The radialis flap will later be fitted into this V-shaped entrance. For this purpose, the radialis flap is also configured in a V-shape at the tip. Then lift the radialis graft. Lifting of the radialis flap by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Drawing the flap boundaries in the presence of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. An 8 x 16 cm graft is drawn in. S-shaped incision along the skin incision in the area of the proximal forearm. Incision of the distal flap borders with separation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection in the area of the venous confluence in the crook of the elbow and identification of the superficial and deep venous system. A pronounced cephalic vein can be seen, which is integrated into the radial flap margin, extending radially. After identification of the external radial nerve ramus, it can be safely spared. Ulnar skin incision down to the deep forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subfascial dissection of the flap from ulnar to radial. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum intact. Dissection up to the edge of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Identification of the vascular pedicle and application of a vascular clamp for approx. 10 minutes: during this time a good perfusion signal is continuously measured. Decision to place the flap on the distal radial stump. Clamping and cutting of the radial artery and the vena comitans. Ligation of the stent. Dissection of the vascular pedicle, also from the depths, with constant blood supply using bipolar coagulation and vascular clips. The radial nerve can be safely identified and protected on the inside of the brachioradialis muscle. Insertion of a retractor between the extensor carpi radialis muscle and the brachioradialis muscle. Dissection in the area of the bifurcation of the brachioradial artery. Now pull in <CLINICIAN_NAME> and remove first the artery and then the veins. The flap can be lifted without complications. The radial artery as well as a deep and a superficial vein are available for anastomosis. This is followed by elevation of an equivalent area of split skin from the right thigh through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the s-shaped, proximal skin incision on the forearm. Incision of the split-thickness skin graft in the usual manner. Application of a wound dressing and a dorsal forearm splint. Application of a wrap bandage. Neck dissection is performed on both sides at the same time as flap lifting. To do this, expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side, the omohyoid muscle of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Then free preparation of the cervical vascular sheath while preserving the facial vein and the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve as well as the accessorius nerve and then release of the neck preparation II a to V a while preserving the plexus branches. Then switch to the opposite side. Here too, expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Here too, free preparation of the internal jugular vein and the cervical vascular sheath. Then release the neck preparations II a to V a while protecting the plexus branches and the hypoglossal and accessory nerves. Deposition of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and closure of the wound on the forearm with split skin from the right thigh by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Reposition the patient and perform the arterial and venous anastomosis. The superior thyroid artery, the facial vein and an outlet from the facial vein are used for this. The cephalic vein and a vein of the deep venous system of the arm are anastomosed. The radialis graft is then inserted and reconstruction of the esophageal inlet begins. For this purpose, the V-shaped defect is reconstructed through the tip of the radialis flap, which is also V-shaped. To do this, sutures are placed and then the remaining graft is sutured in place. At the end, repositioning of the apron flap and suturing of the tracheostoma. A Provox prosthesis is not possible as the esophageal entrance was too deeply infiltrated and the anterior wall had to be reconstructed with the radial flap and this will also not be possible secondarily. At the end, insertion of two Redon drains and two-layer wound closure. The flap pedicle can be doubled in the middle of the neck. A skin monitor was not possible due to the short length of the stalk, but the flap can be checked via the Doppler and also at the base of the tongue via direct inspection. At the very end, the upper edge of the flap is punctured using a cannula. A good arterial blood return is seen immediately. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. After consultation with the surgeon, please continue with the X-ray paps and antibiotics for at least 24 hours.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Free flap (Radial)

An extensive exophytic mass was found, which covered the entire vallecula, infiltrated the base of the tongue on the left side and also infiltrated the lingual epiglottis up to the base. The tumor extends laterally to the pharyngo-epiglottic fold, but does not pass through it, so that the piriform sinus itself is free. Now add the flexible esophagoscope and endoscopy of the esophagus. Advance the instrument into the stomach. If the diaphanoscopy is positive, PEG insertion using the thread pull-through method and if the tent phenomenon is positive. The insertion is successful without any problems. Then suction out the insufflated air after fixing the PEG and withdrawing the esophagoscope. The patient is then repositioned. Now extremely laborious insertion of the TORS blocker. The tumor is only partially exposed. A complete overview is initially not possible due to the bulging base of the tongue. After insertion and docking of the DaVinci robot. Then first retraction of the base of the tongue. The full extent of the tumor can now be seen. Therefore, first traverse the tumor borders with the monopolar spatula. The tumor infiltrates the base of the tongue on the left side. Therefore, start resection at the base of the tongue. Extremely careful dissection here after the resection extends into the depths. However, the lingual artery is not exposed and remains intact. Then resection laterally and medially. Capture the tumor border in the vallecula. This crosses the midline here. Then further resection of the epiglottis. It can be seen that the tumor has almost completely infiltrated the lingual surface of the epiglottis, so that a complete epiglottectomy must be performed. The pocket folds and the endolaryngeal supraglottis are completely tumor-free. The two arytenoid cartilages are also spared from the resection and remain intact. The resection is then performed laterally via the pharyngo-epiglottic fold. Finally, the tumor can be incised in depth and resected in several parts using a piecemeal technique. Representative marginal samples are then taken from the medial as well as lateral, ventral, dorsal and deep settling areas. Some vascular stumps, particularly on the lateral pharyngeal wall, are first exposed and then clipped. A dry wound surface is then revealed underneath. All frozen sections are diagnosed intraoperatively by the pathology colleagues as tumor-free. If the wound is dry, the DaVinci robot is undocked. The patient was then repositioned for ipsilateral neck dissection on the left side. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline. Then incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth in layers. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the posterior digaster venter muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and subsequent insertion of the retractors. Then dissection of the glandular capsule. Clearing of the hypoglossal triangle with exposure of the hypoglossus while sparing all branches of the external carotid artery and internal jugular artery. Followed by a long dissection of the cervical vascular sheath with exposure and protection of the vagus nerve. Subsequent removal of the lateral neck preparation. Then clearing of the ventral neck preparation up to the upper edge of the thyroid gland. Here too, all vessels and nerves are protected. This results in a neck dissection level Ib, II, III, IV and V. A Redon drain is then inserted and the wound is closed in several layers. The patient is then repositioned, initially for tracheotomy. Here too, injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline. Then skin incision in the sense of a modified Kocher incision. Layer-by-layer preparation in depth. Dissection and ligation of several larger pretracheal veins. Then locate the midline and separate the muscles. Further layered dissection in depth. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Once this has been undermined, clamp off the thyroid isthmus on both sides and cut through it. The thyroid gland is then repositioned on both sides and the front of the trachea is exposed. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Then incision of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp. Opening of the trachea. Preparation of a Björk flap. Then suturing of the tracheostoma in the sense of a circular mucocutaneous anastomosis. The patient is then repositioned for neck dissection on the right side. The procedure here is identical to that on the left side. Here too, a skin incision is made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Expose the omohyoid muscle and digaster venter posterior muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and insertion of the retractors. Clearing of the hypoglossal triangle while sparing all branches of the external carotid artery, the internal jugular artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Long dissection of the cervical vascular sheath while sparing the vagus nerve. Dissection of the lateral neck preparation and the anterior neck preparation, again sparing all vascular and nerve structures. This also results in a level Ib to V neck dissection. Subtle hemostasis is also performed here. Then insertion of a Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. The patient is then intubated from the transnasal tube to the tracheostomy tube. This is done without difficulty. After applying a cervical pressure bandage on both sides, the procedure is completed. On the ipsilateral tumor side, several enlarged lymph nodes in the sense of an N2b neck status were found. The right side was clinically unremarkable. Therefore, this is at least a T3 hypopharyngeal carcinoma with a clinical N2b neck status. The final further procedure must then be decided at the interdisciplinary tumor conference after receipt of the final histology.","TORS resection, Tracheotomy, Neck dissection, PEG placement

Laser resection not possible due to extremely poor adjustability. Surgery primarily planned with tumor removal from the outside.","This is followed by bronchoscopic intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Followed by pharyngoscopy again: once again, the small bore tube size C and D is used. Although the tumor can be visualized, its extent is barely detectable with the small bore tube. This once again confirms the indication for an external approach. This is followed by repositioning, injection of a total of 20 ml xylocaine 1% with adrenaline in the area of both sides of the neck and sterile draping. Start with modified apron flaps: The right apron flap is lifted in a typical manner, slightly widened caudally on the left, in order to also develop a platysmal flap from this to cover the defect in the tongue base area if necessary. The flap is elevated to the level of the hyoid bone or the submandibular gland. Neck dissection on the left side: exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle anterior border. Dissection of lymph node fat packet. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein, internal/external carotid artery. Exposure of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve. Development of the dorsal neck preparation with exposure and preservation of the branches of the cervical plexus. Then develop the anterior neck preparation, exposing and preserving the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure and preservation of the cervical artery. This results in an evacuation of levels II to V on the left. Neck dissection on the right side: This is performed in the same way as on the left side, exposing the structures mentioned, which are also preserved. Level II to IV removal is performed here, followed by transcervical tumor resection: exposure and skeletonization of the hyoid bone. The pre-epiglottic fatty tissue is completely removed behind the hyoid bone. This is also removed from the right to the left of the epiglottis and integrated into the tumor preparation. Right paramedian entry into the larynx at the level of the epiglottis. The tumor can now be visualized, viewed with relative difficulty and successively removed by means of inspection and palpation. Tumor is incised on all sides with a safety margin of 1 to 1.5 cm and removed in toto. Two thirds of the epiglottis is freed from the lingual mucosa. The left pharyngeal wall is removed, the base of the tongue is removed by about two thirds, whereby the resection to the right is not too deep, so that the lingualis can be spared here. Resection extends in the area of the pharyngeal wall to just before the tonsil lobe. Tumor is removed and marked with a suture. Due to the relative proximity caudally in the area of the epiglottis, a strip of mucosa is removed from the epiglottis area, which corresponds to the rest of the epiglottis mucosa lingually. The tumor is removed in the frozen section towards all edges in the healthy area, but small focal in-situ infiltrations are still visible in the area of the mucosa sample of the remainder of the lingual epiglottis. Therefore, the tip of the epiglottis is removed, the left third and a thick strip of mucosa in the direction of the arytenoid fold and pharyngeal wall. This preparation is thread-marked and sent for frozen section examination, whereby the side remote from the tumor is marked. There are no more infiltrates here, so that an R0 resection can now be assumed. This results in a defect of two thirds of the tongue base mucosa area, the pharyngeal wall on the left, from the tonsil lobe to the hypopharyngeal entrance and supraglottic on the left including the aryepiglottic fold. The three-dimensional shape of the defect is measured. The radial flap is now elevated: Flap size is drawn in according to the three-dimensional requirements. The skin monitor is also drawn in. Then angle the arm and apply a tourniquet. Gradually develop the radial artery flap from subfascial, taking subcutaneous tissue with it, if necessary for the skin monitor. The radial artery is placed caudally and supplied proximally and distally using 4.0 Prolene puncture ligatures. Outgoing smaller vessels to the muscles are supplied with clips. Confluence of the radial vein, radial artery and cephalic artery can be exposed in the elbow area. A running cutaneous nerve can also be dissected and lifted along with the flap. After opening the tourniquet, good perfusion of the flap and the skin monitor. Deposition of the flap, whereby the outlet of the radial artery is treated with a 4.0 Prolene stitch. Veins are ligated. Flap vessels are flushed with heparin and placed in saline compresses. The flap is then sutured into the defect: Once the flap has been placed in the correct position, it is sutured successively using 3.0 Vicryl single-button sutures. Tension-free suturing with complete closure. Flap handle is passed through from left to right. The flap is connected in an end-to-end anastomosis between the radial artery and the superior thyroid artery using 9.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After releasing the clamp, good perfusion and good venous return. The flap vein and facial vein are then conditioned. After measuring the vascular lumen, the anastomosis is performed without complications using a 3 mm vascular coupler. After opening the clamps, good reflux, positive smear phenomenon. Overall good perfusion of the flap. Co-prepared cutaneous nerve is now adapted on the left side to the stump of the superior laryngeal nerve, which had to be sacrificed during tumor resection, using several Ethilon 9.0 sutures to sensitize the radial lobe. Subsequent tracheostoma creation: splitting of the thyroid isthmus and coagulation. This is very thin and rudimentary. Visualization of the anterior tracheal wall. Entering the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space and creation of a broadly pedicled Björk flap. Epithelialization of this. Re-intubation and insertion of a 9 mm tracheal cannula. This is followed by irrigation of the wound area with H2O2 and Ringer's solution, as directly after the tumor resection, as well as at the end of the entire operation, and careful hemostasis. Insertion of a Redon drain into each side. Repositioning of the apron flap. Skin incision at the level of the skin monitor and insertion of the skin monitor. This is fixed in the skin without tension using subcutaneous sutures and skin sutures. The wound is then closed in layers in the area of the apron flap and the epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Full-thickness skin removal from the groin: Depending on the size of the defect, a piece of skin, approx. 8 x 6 cm, is harvested from the groin as a full-thickness skin graft. This is thinned out. In the groin area, after mobilization of the skin, the wound is closed in layers and a Redon drain is inserted with minimal tension. After thinning, the removed full-thickness skin is sutured into the area of the forearm defect without tension. The forearm is closed in layers. A sterile Vacuseal dressing is then applied, which works with a suction of 75 mmHg. The arm is then wrapped in a Kramer splint using an elastic bandage. Then mark the localization for vascular control with the Doppler. The cannula is fixed with tape. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient received Unacid intraoperatively as an antibiotic. Please continue postoperatively for 1 week. Heparin at 500 units per hour, as started intraoperatively, continue for 5 days postoperatively. Feeding via the previously inserted PEG tube for approx. 10 days, then gruel swallow and swallowing attempt, if necessary diet build-up, but intensive swallowing training is certainly necessary here. Please contact the voice and speech department or speech therapist at an early stage. Overall cT2-3 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left, postoperative RT or RCT to be discussed after histological findings.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy

Due to the patient's poor general condition, primary radiochemotherapy is not an option, therefore the above-mentioned operation is indicated.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation via the patient's existing tracheostoma, the operation is first planned during pharyngoscopy. This reveals a right-sided, exophytic tumor, which extends in the area of the oropharyngeal side wall to the tonsil and then affects the pharyngoepiglottic fold, involves the entire right piriform sinus and also clearly affects the postcricoid region in the area of the right side, almost completely encloses the lateral piriform sinus laterally, but only slightly affects the posterior pharyngeal wall posteriorly. In the larynx, the epiglottis is partially affected, the right aryepiglottic fold, the right arytenoid cartilage and the pocket folds are completely affected. The tumor grows over the interarytenoid region into the postcricoid region. The left arytenoid cartilage and the left aryepiglottic fold are tumor-free, as are the vallecula and more than half of the epiglottis. Deep down, the left piriform sinus is completely free, but the entrance to the esophagus is stenosed and it is not possible to determine exactly to what extent the entrance to the esophagus is affected, but this can be assumed based on the fixation. Discussion of findings with <CLINICIAN_NAME> and procedure for surgery. First, formation of an apron flap, which extends from the tracheostoma to the far lateral side. Then create the apron flap, partly with the help of the BiClamp system. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides and form the apron flap up to above the hyoid bone. Now turn to the neck dissection of the right side. The very prominent, partially fixed lump can be easily palpated here. An attempt is first made to dissect the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein, but it quickly becomes apparent that they are completely infiltrated by the tumor. The decision is now made to perform a radical neck dissection. The posterior digastric venter muscle and the submandibular gland are exposed and isolated. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is then imaged in the cranial region. The accessorius nerve can also be identified here and initially spared. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is then resected in its caudal area and the same is done in its cranial area, taking care to spare the part of the accessorius nerve that goes towards the trapezius muscle. Now continue to form the lateral border of the neck. Deep exposure of the plexus branches and the scalene muscles in their lateral area. Then complete visualization of the internal jugular vein in its caudal and cranial course. Identify the hypoglossal nerve and spare the last one. The internal jugular vein is now ligated twice and separated cranially and caudally. Prior to this, the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve were identified and spared. In addition to the large tumor, which appears to be fixed towards the thyroid cartilage, there are also additional tumor conglomerates in level IIa. Now turn to the medial neck preparation. To do this, follow the omohyoid muscle anteriorly and the digastric muscle anteriorly. Then form the medial neck preparation along the thyroid cartilage muscles. This reveals a site between the thyroid cartilage and the hyoid bone where the tumor conglomerate is connected to the actual tumor per continuitatem. This site is cut and marked on both the thyroid cartilage and the tumor. The medial neck preparation is then followed up, sparing the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery, which is clamped. Then expose the carotid artery from caudal to cranial and also the vagus nerve from caudal to cranial. Now turn again to level II b and here further development of the lateral neck preparation from cranial to caudal while sparing the plexus branches. At the end, the entire neck preparation is formed in a large block. Now turn to the neck dissection of the left side. No large lymph node metastases are visible here, therefore expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Formation of the anterior border and visualization of the posterior digastric venter muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Identify the accessorius nerve and then form the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial. Here, after identifying and sparing the vagus nerve, the lateral neck preparation is formed while sparing the accessorius nerve and plexus branches. Then turn to the medial neck preparation. Trace the omohyoid muscle, trace the digastric muscle anteriorly and expose and skeletonize the submandibular gland and spare the facial vein. After identifying the hypoglossal nerve, the medial neck preparation is also formed, whereby the superior thyroid artery is also spared. Preparation for laryngectomy/partial pharyngectomy. Preparation of the tracheostoma. Exposure of the right thyroid gland from the trachea while protecting the blood supply. Then expose the cervical vascular sheath on the left side from the laryngeal preparation down to the vertebral body. Further cranial ligation of the bundle of the superior laryngeal nerve and skeletonization in the upper area with monopolar coagulation of the hyoid bone. Now the constrictor pharyngeal muscle on the left side of the thyroid cartilage is also cut with the monopolar and the upper thyroid cartilage horn is exposed. Then, with the help of the Freer raspatory, expose the piriform sinus from the inner side of the thyroid cartilage. Now turn to the right side. As described above, this shows a tumor breakthrough between the thyroid cartilage and hyoid bone, which is why the constrictor pharyngis muscle is not exposed here. Only the carotid artery is exposed from the laryngeal preparation. It can also be seen that the right lobe of the thyroid gland is severely regressively altered with cystic areas and a fixation to the tumor. For this reason, the right thyroid lobe is also isolated from the surrounding tissue, with the inferior thyroid artery and the middle thyroid vein ligated and ligated. The right thyroid lobe thus remains on the subsequent tumor specimen. Now, after previously skeletonizing the hyoid bone, the transoral localization of the epiglottis and the submucosal dissection along the left lingual epiglottis cartilage is performed through the neck. The pharynx is then opened on the left side and initially dissected along the left aryepiglottic fold. It can be seen that the tumor clearly involves the oropharynx on the right side, as already described above. The entire right hypopharynx is full of exophytic tumor. The resection is now extended to the right via the right base of the tongue, then to the right tonsil. Previously, the internal carotid artery was traced far to the cranial side in order to isolate it from the pharynx and the lingual artery was ligated and cut. The resection is now extended to the left via the aryepiglottic fold to the left arytenoid cartilage. However, the postcricoid region is affected up to the midline and cannot be preserved. An attempt is made to preserve the left piriform sinus, but it is suspected that the tumor is also growing submucosally through the thyroid cartilage to the left piriform sinus. A frozen section sample is therefore taken here, which is later found to contain tumor. The resection now continues caudally. On the right side, a good part of the posterior pharyngeal wall is resected, on the left side a little of the postcricoid region can be spared. The esophageal entrance is now reached. It can be seen here that the tumor infiltrates the esophageal entrance on its anterior and right side. The specimen is removed here and a marginal sample is also taken, which is later found to be tumor-infested. Another problem area is the base of the tongue, which is also infiltrated at certain points and, after consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, it is suspected that infiltrated regions repeatedly appear between the base of the tongue and the esophageal opening on the right side. Therefore, after careful assessment of the situation, <CLINICIAN_NAME> decided to perform a complete pharyngectomy and also a resection in the area of the esophageal inlet. Prior to this, part of the base of the tongue is resected and a frozen section is performed again, which is later found to be tumor-free. This is followed by pharyngectomy and a myotomy of the upper esophageal sphincter in the caudal region and a resection in the anterior and right-accentuated region. All frozen sections are later found to be tumor-free. Radial flap elevation and the formation of a complete pharyngeal replacement are now performed, which is dictated separately by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The resulting defect in the area of the left forearm is approximately 10 x 15 cm long and is removed with 2 strips of split skin, 0.7 mm thick, from the area of the right thigh and then painstakingly sutured in place. Finally, the Mepilex insert is applied to both regions, the thigh and the forearm, and the forearm is bandaged with a splint. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME> Patient with histologically confirmed incontinuitous growing cT4a laryngeal carcinoma on the right. Therefore above mentioned surgical indication. Flap coverage included in the surgical planning preoperatively. After completion of the pharyngectomy, the marginal specimens in the tongue base area and the circular marginal specimen in the esophageal entrance area were finally free of carcinoma. The circular pharynx must now be replaced. Now remove the radial lobe: mark a flap 9 or 10.5 cm wide and 15 cm long on the left forearm. Also mark a skin monitor island. Successive cutting around the flap at the marked borders subfascially, the flap is finally lifted from all sides. Lifting is performed with the skin monitor including the superficial venous system. Exposure of the vascular pedicle after dissection of the brachioradialis muscle. Finally, distal placement of the flap on the radial artery and vein. Here, 4-0 prolene puncture ligation is performed on both sides. Successive lifting of the flap along its pedicle, taking the superficial venous system and the skin monitor with it. Outgoing vessels are successively clipped or bipolized. Exposure of the deep and superficial vascular pedicle in the crook of the elbow. The radial artery is placed in front of the interosseous artery and sutured over. Finally, the cephalic vein and a further medially larger outgoing vein are removed in the direction of the basilar vein. The superficial and deep venous systems are connected and have an outflow via these two veins. The most careful hemostasis was performed in the area of the flap before the vessels were removed. Subsequently, careful hemostasis was also performed in the area of the forearm. Successive closure of the forearm, primarily in the cranial area. Depending on the skin defect, 0.7 mm thick split skin is now removed using the dermatome. This is successively sutured into the forearm skin defect. Complete tension-free coverage of the skin defect on the forearm. A hydrocolloid lavanide-Mepilex dressing is then applied. Loosely placed swabs are placed over this. Wrap the forearm in absorbent cotton. Wrap an elastic bandage around the splint. The arm is then inserted. This is followed by the total pharyngeal set using the radial flap: successive suturing of the flap, initially caudally with 4-0 Vicryl single button sutures, paying strict attention to sufficient residual lumen thickness at the neopharyngo-oesophagial junction. Passage is finally easy to pass with the finger. The esophageal entrance is plastically widened in the sense of a continuous myotomy with mucosal transection. The appropriately shaped radial flap is now sutured into the incision. Successive suturing of the flap also from the cranial side with Vicryl 3-0 single button sutures, whereby a tension-free closure is achieved at the junction of the base of the tongue or tonsil lobe and radialis flap. Laterally, the radial lobe is sutured to itself. Over-sewing in the lateral area and also caudally and cranially at the transition to the base of the tongue in a second layer. The vessels on the sides of the neck are then conditioned. The left side of the neck is selected. The superior thyroid artery is selected. After conditioning the arteries, the radial artery is sutured end-to-end with the superior thyroid artery using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow and good venous return. This is followed by 2 venous anastomoses between the main outlets and the facial vein. After conditioning the vein, the smaller vein is first anastomosed using a 2/5 coupler and finally the larger vein is anastomosed using a 3/0 coupler. In each case, after opening the clamps, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. At the end, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The pedicle is now placed in such a way that kinking of the vessels is largely prevented. For this purpose, the skin monitor is placed in the middle over the flap. This is followed by extensive hemostasis of the entire wound area on both sides. Redon drainage on both sides. Repositioning of the apron flap. This is opened medially and the skin monitor is sutured in place without tension. Subsequent successive closure of the neck wounds in layers with epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Finally, insertion of a 10 mm tracheostomy tube which is fixed with sutures. Postoperatively, the patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue intraoperative antibiotic treatment with Unacid for 1 week. Please continue heparin perfusor with 500 E/hour for 5 days. Feeding via PEG tube for 10-12 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Check the flap clinically on the skin monitor and by Doppler according to the scheme for 5 days. Overall, cT4a cN2c hypopharyngeal carcinoma with invasion into the larynx and continuous growth into the soft tissues of the neck. Postoperative RCT is certainly indicated, but this should be discussed again in the interdisciplinary tumor conference in view of the concomitant diseases.","Complete pharyngectomy and laryngectomy

Application of a wound dressing, forearm splint, completion of graft elevation without complications. This is followed by transoral tumor resection. The resection includes the anterior palatal arch and the lower 2/3 of the tonsil bed. It extends laterally up to the mandible and passes ventrally into the lateral base of the tongue and the base of the tongue to then extend over the adjacent hypopharynx and then also over the posterior wall of the hypopharynx. The submandibular gland is reached and visualized in depth. The specimen is marked and oriented accordingly on a cork plate before being sent in. In the frozen section histological examination, parts of CIS can still be found in the area of the posterior hypopharyngeal wall as well as in the area of the lateral resection margin in the area of the mandible/ transition to the palatal arch. Corresponding resections are performed here, which are then found to be tumor-free by frozen section histology. Overall, a defect of about 10 x 5 cm is created. The radial artery flap to be removed from the left forearm is the same size. Transition first to neck dissection on the left side. Here, regions I to V are removed while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. The tendon of the digastric muscle is then severed. Dissection of the superior thyroid artery first, which, however, proves to be of small caliber. The lingual and facial arteries are then dissected. Finally, the facial artery is removed from the mandible and beaten downwards and later used for anastomosis. Then create a passage into the oral cavity above the digastric muscle. Perform selective neck dissection of regions II to IV on the right side while preserving all lymphatic structures. There is no clinical evidence of lymph node metastasis on either side. After lifting the radial lobe graft, it is swung into the defect and sutured into the defect both transorally and transcervically. The facial artery is then anastomosed to the radial artery. Venous drainage is achieved through 2 veins at the end of the lateral anastomosis to the internal jugular vein. After completion of Redon wound drainage on both sides, the wound is closed in several layers. Finally, the patient is intubated with an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube. End of the operation, transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Transoral tumor resection of a tumor in the area of the glossotonsillar groove with defect coverage using a free radial flap graft from the left forearm, neck dissection on both sides, tracheostoma placement.","Resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy, PEG placement

Although there was initially no evidence of primary carcinoma, the follow-up ENT examination revealed tonsillar carcinoma. Sonographic evidence of cN2b neck status.","Firstly, inspection of the oral cavity: insertion of the tonsil plug and inspection of the tonsil region. On the left side, the tonsil is fissured with a small fibroma-like appendage. On the right side, the tonsil shows exophytic changes. A clear induration can be palpated, which extends to the lower tonsil pole. Macroscopically, a T2 tonsillar carcinoma is highly suspected. Then perform an enoral tumor resection: Resection of the tumor including the anterior palatal arch. Successive dissection of the tumorous mass with removal of the pharyngeal muscles; however, the posterior palatal arch can remain intact and is not infiltrated macroscopically or by palpation. Inclusion of the lower tonsil pole and a circumscribed area of the base of the tongue. The preparation is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. The fibroma-like appendage of the left tonsil is now removed. Enter with the small bore tube and re-inspect and re-inspect the hypopharynx and larynx. Here, inconspicuous conditions are seen in the region of the base of the tongue, the vallecula and the epiglottis, as well as inconspicuous conditions in the region of the hypopharynx with well-developed piriform sinuses, and the postcricoid region up to the esophageal opening is also clear. Adjustment of the endolarynx. Inconspicuous conditions here as well. The flexible esophagogastroscopy is then performed: easy to see through to the stomach. Inconspicuous conditions in the stomach area. Now, with excellent diaphanoscopy, insertion of a PEG tube. After a problem-free puncture of the stomach using the usual thread pull-through method. Inspection of the esophagus on reflection. Mucosal conditions are visible on all sides, but without any suspicious changes. The frozen section diagnosis now confirms the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. In the area of the medio-caudal marking, higher grade dysplasia is visible, otherwise the frozen section shows an R0 resection. A resection is now performed medio-caudally towards the base of the tongue and the posterior pharyngeal wall, extending to the vallecula. A final marginal sample covering the entire area is sent for frozen section diagnostics and later assessed as tumor-free. After resection, a barely covered, pulsating structure is found at the transition from the oropharynx to the hypopharynx, which could correspond to the internal carotid artery on Doppler sonography, but is otherwise located at the level of the exit of the lingual artery. Decision to explore as part of the neck dissection. In the case of dry enoral conditions, repositioning for neck dissection on both sides: injection with xylocaine and adrenaline. Start with the right side: To do this, make a skin incision by cutting around the previous scar submandibularly. Subcutaneous scarring in the area of the skin incision. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid after cutting through platysma remnants. A scar block extends into the depths in the area of the previous operation. Dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Then exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle and exposure up to the hyoid. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Pronounced scarring here too. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the facial vein. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve and successive removal of the anterior neck preparation. Pronounced scarring in the area of the anterior jugular vein. A clear tumorous mass is palpable caudal to the vein, which is located directly on the internal jugular vein and appears to infiltrate it palpatorily. A tumor cone also grows parallel to the vein cranially below the accessorius level. Further dissection of the vein. Pronounced scarring, but also clear evidence of tumor infiltration, so that the decision is made to resect the vein. Caudal exposure of the vein. Exposure of the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Removal of the vein after ligation and repositioning and cranial dissection. The mass infiltrates a few plexus branches. These are also resected. Now continue to expose the common carotid artery. Identification of the exit of the superior thyroid artery. Identification of the external and internal carotid artery. Cranial to the exit of the superior thyroid artery, a very strong vessel branches off and runs directly towards the resection area. Trace and visualize this vessel. In terms of caliber and localization, this vessel corresponds to the one seen enorally and is then removed after ligation and repositioning. Now successive dissection of the lymph node metastasis cranially. Cranial removal of the vein, also after ligation and repositioning. The accessor nerve can be spared. If there is significant scarring, there is infiltration of the tumor. Circumscribed with the sternocleidomastoid muscle, this is partially resected. The accessorius triangle has already been resected. Level Vb is now removed while carefully preserving the supraclavicular vessels. Final inspection and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure and turning to the opposite side: skin incision. Cut through subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma and creation of a platysmal flap. Exposure of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. These are spared (as on the opposite side). Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection and exposure of the accessorius nerve. Exposure and free preparation of the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Completing the dissection towards the hyoid. Exposure of the facial vein and preservation of the vein. Expose the digastric muscle posteriorly. Now successively expose the anterior neck preparation. Expose the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve as well as the cervical artery. Preservation of the structures. Further exposure of the facial vein and free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Cranial preparation. It can now be seen that the nervus accessorius runs behind the vein on this side. Careful protection. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and completion of level Va. If the wound is dry, irrigation of the wound and two-layer wound closure after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Now re-inspect enorally. Finally, meticulous hemostasis. The previously identified vessel can no longer be visualized by inspection and Doppler sonography. Now mucosal adaptation in the area of the vallecula and hypopharynx and, after final inspection, completion of the procedure. On the way to the recovery room, the patient can now be aspirated with fresh blood. In addition, saturation is only 90% with oxygen supply, so the patient is taken back to the operating room and reintubated. Re-inspection. A discrete, diffuse, venous hemorrhage is found, which is treated by meticulous hemostasis. Finally, absolutely dry wound conditions. Due to urgent indication by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and anesthesia, the patient is now tracheostomized. Repositioning of the patient. After infiltration anesthesia with xylocaine and the addition of adrenaline, a sparing, horizontal skin incision is made below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. An extremely thin thyroid isthmus is visible. This is bipolarly coagulated and severed. Further exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea and insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Performing a mucocutaneous anastomosis and subsequent problem-free reintubation to an 8-gauge tracheoflex cannula. Conclusion: At least cT2 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Performance of a modified radical neck dissection on the right with resection of the internal jugular vein and partial resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The patient should remain fasting for at least 3 to 5 days. After this, a diet should be started, initially with liquid food. Rapid decannulation should be aimed for. If possible, the first cannula should not be changed before the 4th postoperative day. Staging should also be supplemented during the further inpatient course. Due to the extent of the tumor, adjuvant therapy is certainly indicated.","Tonsillectomy, Neck dissection

Therefore, there is now an indication for transoral laser resection.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthetist, a microlaryngoscopy is performed first. Here the verrucous carcinoma of the entire left vocal fold can be confirmed. On the right, the findings are limited to the anterior third of the left vocal fold. Now setting with the Kleinsasser C-tube. Start resection with the CO2 laser at 3 watts in the posterior region, directly at the border with the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage. Then also partial resection of the pocket fold on the left side. The resection extends well into the subglottic area. Approximately 5 mm in front of the anterior commissure, the first part of the tumor preparation is resected. This is followed by repositioning with the Kleinsasser D-tube and removal of the remaining tumor up to the anterior commissure. The thyroid cartilage is resected from its inner side together with the perichondrium in this area. Hemostasis by means of monopolar coagulation, using the forceps and the suction cup. Now turn to the right side. Here there is a much less exophytic aspect, but more a restless mucosa, which is why a partial chordectomy is performed here, leaving parts of the ligament and the vocalis muscle intact. This extends approximately 8 mm posteriorly. After complete resection with the laser, the frozen section diagnosis is performed. Two strips are taken from the right side, one cranial and one caudal, and from the left side one anterior, one caudal and one posterior. A frozen section in the cranial region is not performed due to the resection of the pocket fold and the resulting large distance to the tumor. The frozen section diagnosis resulted in an R0 resection. After renewed careful hemostasis, the procedure is completed without bleeding and without complications. The patient should be presented at the tumor conference and undergo a follow-up microlaryngoscopy in 8 weeks. In addition, care should be taken to also perform a Dacron foil or Keel system in the event of synechiae of the anterior commissure.","Laser chordectomy left, Partial chordectomy right

Subsequently intubation and pharyngoscopy as well as laryngoscopy with the Kleinsasser tube (C-tube). An exulcerated tumor measuring approx. 4 x 2 cm was found in the area of the edge of the tongue and floor of the mouth on the left, from which a biopsy was taken for frozen section diagnosis. In addition, there is a leukoplakia behind the last molar on the left alveolar ridge of the mandible. The left tonsil also shows a discrete lesion, which is also biopsied. The previously described leukoplakia is removed by excisional biopsy. This is followed by esophagogastroscopy with a flexible instrument and placement of a PEG. After PEG placement without complications, enoral tumor resection is performed. Now the tumor is gradually bypassed with the monopolar needle at a macroscopic safety distance of 1 cm. As soon as the deep soft tissue gives way, a corresponding safety distance is maintained. The tumor extends from the anterior third of the tongue on the left over the entire dorsal edge of the tongue to approx. 1-2 cm into the base of the tongue. The tumor also reaches the glossotonsillar groove. After carefully moving around the tumor with the monopolar and removing the resected specimen, it is marked and sent for frozen section diagnostics. Neck dissection follows on the left side with a submandibular skin incision approx. 2 QF below the mandible and, after appropriate skin incision, preparation of the cranial and caudal platysmal flaps. Sparing of the external jugular vein and the auricularis magnus nerve. Dissection of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle up to the vascular nerve sheath. Dissection along the omohyoid muscle to the hyoid bone and along the diagstricus muscle to the laterobasis. Dissection along the internal jugular vein after previous exposure and securing of the accessorius nerve. Lifting of the level II, III and IV neck block while sparing all nerves and vascular structures. This is followed by the removal of level V with protection of the accessorius nerve, the cervical accessorius plexus and the cervical plexus. Enlarged lymph nodes are particularly evident in the area of level II. Level Va also shows enlarged lymph nodes in the cranial area. After careful removal of the corresponding regions, the submandibular gland is dissected and removed. The surrounding lymph nodes of region Ib are also carefully removed. Care is taken to protect the marginal ramus and facial nerve. Finally, the ligation of the lingual artery is performed due to the extensive partial resection of the enoral tongue. Irrigation of the wound, careful hemostasis and insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Suturing of the platysma, subcutaneous sutures and skin sutures. After the frozen section has revealed submucosal carcinoma infiltrates, the corresponding areas are resected again and final margin samples are taken. These final margin samples now reveal a carcinoma-free finding in the frozen section diagnosis. Once again, careful hemostasis is carried out before a tracheostomy is performed due to the extensive resection area, the associated risk of swelling and bleeding and the predicted difficulty in swallowing. This involves a jugular skin incision and dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and prelaryngeal muscles. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Undercutting of the isthmus and careful coagulation of the isthmus. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea, creation of a caudally pedicled suture in the sense of a Björk flap. Suturing of the Björk flap with 2 fixation sutures and a cranial suture of the stoma. Lateral skin sutures. Transfer to an 8-gauge Rüsch cannula with blocking.

This is not successful in the absence of diaphanoscopy, so a nasogastric feeding tube is inserted via the left nostril. Then insertion of the T-barrier and start of transoral tumor resection with the ultrasonic knife. The soft palate is resected almost completely on the right side. The resection then extends caudally on the posterior wall of the hypopharynx approximately in the median line. Laterally, pterygoid muscles and the fatty tissue of the soft tissues of the neck are reached. The tumor can thus be dissected out successively with an appropriate safety margin up to the glossotonsillar groove and at the base of the tongue and finally removed. Inspection of the specimen after removal. A muscular cuff is still present at the base of the tumor, but slightly less than at the edges. Therefore, a resection is performed from the muscles at the corresponding site. Samples are then taken from the margins around the defect. All histologies are examined using frozen section histology and are found to be tumor-free, including the main specimen. Subsequently, transition to neck dissection on the right side. The anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is skeletonized after a skin incision. Then skeletonize the digastric muscle and successively remove regions II to V while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. There is no indication of a suspicious lymph node. Subsequent evacuation of regions Ia and Ib including submandibulectomy. The defect is completed in the pharyngeal direction. The lingual nerve and the hypoglossal nerve are exposed and can be spared. Dissection of the superior thyroid vein for the subsequent anastomosis. Subsequent transition to the opposite side. Here, regions II to V are dissected in the usual way, preserving all non-lymphatic structures. Here too, there is no clinical evidence of a suspicious lymph node. Insertion of a Redon suction drain on the left side and two-layer wound closure in the usual manner. In the meantime, start lifting the radial lobe graft from the left forearm. The defect measures approximately 11 x 7.5 cm. After an S-shaped skin incision, the superficial vein is dissected distally. The two muscle bellies are then pushed apart with identification of the underlying vascular pedicle. This is dissected circularly. The flap is then first incised ulnarly down to the fascia and dissected radially down to the tendon of the flexor carpi muscle. Similarly, the flap is dissected radially while sparing the sensitive nerve. The pedicle and the entire flap are then detached from its base. The confluence is then dissected cranially, exposing the exit of the radial artery and dissecting two superficial veins beyond the antecubital fossa. The radial artery flap graft was then removed. In the meantime, the split-thickness skin was removed from the right thigh. This is then used to cover the defect on the left forearm. Now insertion of the radialis graft into the oropharyngeal defect. The graft is sutured into the defect transorally, whereby the cranial part is doubled in the area of the soft palate. The graft is then sutured caudally close to the base of the tongue. However, the last 5 sutures are performed transcervically from the right. The arterial anastomosis of the radial artery to the superior thyroid artery is then performed. The two veins of the left arm are then connected to the internal jugular vein using an end-to-side technique. Then carefully stop some bleeding from the flap until the blood is dry. Previously a Redon suction drainage into the right side of the neck. Insertion of an Easy flow drainage. Checking the patency of the venous anastomoses. Two-layer wound closure. In addition, the tracheostomy was performed between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Finally, after completion of the operation, sterile neck dressing and reintubation of the patient on a 9-gauge tracheostomy tube. Conclusion: Transoral resection of a tonsillar carcinoma on the right side and selective neck dissection on both sides with preservation of all non-lymphatic structures. Right oropharyngeal defect coverage with a radial flap graft from the left forearm. Defect coverage on the left forearm with split skin from the right thigh. Additional tracheotomy performed.

A sample was taken alio loco, which revealed a G2 squamous cell carcinoma. CT imaging of the primary was not conclusive due to dental artifacts. Sonography showed a cN0 neck status. The patient was informed in detail about the procedure and had sufficient time to ask questions.","After induction of anesthesia by the anesthesiology colleagues, first rigid tracheoscopy. The trachea is free of irritation up to the tracheal bifurcation. Subsequently intubation by the anesthesia colleagues and transition to flexible esophagoscopy. Under constant air insufgflation, pre-scopy up to the stomach, the mucosa is free of irritation even with inversion, no ulcer, no bleeding. Then aspirate the air from the stomach and carefully mirror back. No abnormalities in the esophagus. Subsequent low head position and mircolaryngoscopy. The vocal folds and anterior commissure are smooth and without irritation, as are the arytenoid cartilage and postcricoid region. The piriform sinus and vallecula are freely unfoldable, no mass. Tonsils and base of trachea also without irritation and free to palpate. Subsequent addition of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Snaring of the tongue and insertion of a covered mouth guard. A whitish mucosa with extensions and palpatory hardening, approx. 2x0.5 cm in size, is visible on the left edge of the tongue in the posterior third. The mucosa appears to be easily displaceable against the muscle. The area was then resected with an electric needle, suture marking at ant/post and superior. The mass was completely removed by palpation and inspection. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section examination. This revealed higher grade dysplastic cells in the superior margin up to 0.1 cm from the resection margin, which is why a further resection was performed here, which was then sent for final histology. Subsequent meticulous hemostasis using bipolar coagulation and adaptive sutures with Vicryl 4-0. Removal of the mouth retractor, removal of the tongue loop, dental status as preoperative. Conclusion: the patient underwent an excision biopsy for cT1 cN0 tongue margin carcinoma with alio loco confirmed squamous cell carcinoma at the left tongue margin. The frozen section resulted in a complete resection; in the case of higher grade dysplasia in the superior margin, a further resection was performed.

Due to the number and shape of conspicuous lymph nodes on both sides of the neck, which were described on CT, the indication for tumor removal and neck dissection on both sides was given in advance.","First, the patient is positioned and another panendoscopy is performed to confirm the findings. The findings are essentially unchanged compared to the previous examination, with the tumor extending as described above. Otherwise no indication of a secondary tumor. Then insertion of the Olympus oral retractor and adjustment of the tonsil lodge. Then insertion and positioning of the robotic arms. Use a monopolar spatula and Maryland forceps. Then expose the tumor. With a sufficient safety margin, start the resection on the anterior soft palate parauvularly. The resection is then performed along the posterior molar to the base of the tongue via the glossotonsillar groove. As the tumor cannot be reliably separated from the base of the tongue here, a small part of the base of the tongue is resected. The tumor is then developed and a partial resection of the posterior palatal arch is performed. The dissection is performed in such a way that a soft tissue margin remains on the tonsil capsule. There is no evidence of tumor infiltration in the area of the lateral tonsil capsule. After complete removal, the specimen is then thread-marked and sent for histopathological assessment. In the area of the scarce resections at the glossotonsillar groove and at the base of the tongue, additional marginal samples are taken, which are assessed as tumor-free in the frozen section. After tumor removal, the most subtle hemostasis is performed. Then absolutely dry wound conditions. Then removal of the oral retractor and removal of the surgical instruments. The patient is then repositioned for neck dissection on both sides. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline on both sides of the neck. Then start the neck dissection on the left side via a skin incision along the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then layer-by-layer dissection in depth after cutting through the platysma, exposing the anterior edge of the muscle. Then expose the cervical vascular sheath. Now dissect along and expose the cervical vascular sheath. A large conglomerate of lymph nodes can be seen in the area of the venous angle. The lymph nodes also appear clinically conspicuous here. Then dissection of level Ib while preserving the branches of the external carotid artery and the internal jugular artery. The capsule of the submandibular gland is not removed during dissection. Subsequently, further dissection of levels II, III, IV and V. Numerous lymph nodes already extend caudally along the cervical vascular sheath, so that the dissection is also carried out far caudally. When the specimen is placed in the caudal section, an opening of the thoracic duct can be seen, with fluid leaking out here. This area is then sutured over with a small amount of sternocleidomastoid muscle and the entire region carefully stitched over. Even when the intrathoracic pressure was raised via a peep by the colleagues in the anesthesia department, there was no further leakage of chyle. Subsequent subtle hemostasis and insertion of a Redon drain. Then two-layer wound closure. Now move to the right side. Here too, skin incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then layer-by-layer dissection in depth. Cut through the platysma, then expose the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the cervical vascular sheath. Subsequently, a clearly smaller conglomerate can be seen at the lymph node in the venous angle. Then evacuation of level Ib, sparing the branches of the external carotid artery and internal jugular artery. Level II and III were also removed. After no further suspicious nodes are found in the caudal region, which are also not described on CT, and the tumor is nowhere near the midline, no further clearing of levels IV and V is performed. Subtle hemostasis is then performed and a Redon drain is then inserted. Here too, subsequent two-layer wound closure. After bandaging, the procedure is completed and the patient is transferred to the recovery room after extubation.","Transoral robot-assisted tumor removal, Neck dissection

Decision to perform transoral tumor resection. Recheck of the vocal fold findings: Here the findings are rather inconspicuous. Based on the histology, decision to perform laser resection. Initial PEG placement 9 Charričre: insertion of the flexible esophagogastroscope. Inspection of the gastric mucosa and oesophagus and then placement of the gastric tube under strict diaphanoscopic control. Fixation of the holding plates and repositioning for laser resection: Here, the tumor is excised relatively superficially from dorsal to anterior after power with 5 watts and continuous mode of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. 2 anterior and dorsal margin samples are sent for frozen section histology. Here, dysplasia is still found in the dorsal part, and a new microlaryngoscopic ablation is performed in the dorsal part, well within the normal healthy area, for final histological assessment. Hemostasis with a supratip. If the wound is inconspicuous, repositioning for modified radical neck dissection on the right side: curved skin incision. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid after cutting through the platysma. No ligation of the external jugular vein, but lateral displacement to reduce lymphoedema. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. Now from caudal to cranial mobilization of the sternocleidomastoid. Locate the accessor nerve, which is found, dissected further cranially and spared in the further course of the operation. Establish the upper resection margin at the belly of the digaster muscle, which is followed ventrally. Now lateral to the internal jugular vein, place the caudal neck preparation in the area of region IV. No conspicuous lymph nodes here and from caudal to cranial, after exposing the vagus nerve and phrenic nerve on the scalenus muscles, consecutive development of the lateral neck preparation up to the accessorius triangle. Detachment of the same along the digastric muscle. Dissection of the submandibular gland, which is then deposited at the whartonian duct. The facial artery and facial vein are selectively dissected and spared. In the depth of the submandibular region (region Ib), removal of a conspicuous lymph node without capsular perforation. Careful hemostasis and dissection of the carotid bifurcation, especially the thyroid artery for subsequent vascularization. Now complete the ventral neck preparation and repeat hemostasis. Irrigation with H2O and repositioning for neck dissection on the left side: also here skin incision and dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and, while preserving the accessorius nerve, the jugular vein, exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and here a modified radical neck dissection of levels II, III, IV and V is performed. Here too, meticulous hemostasis and completion of the procedure on the left side of the neck. Now horizontal skin incision for tracheotomy. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue to the infralaryngeal musculature, blunt, partly sharp cutting of the same and mobilization of the thyroid isthmus. This is undermined, grasped with 2 clamps and treated with a tobacco pouch suture after transection. The tracheal lumen is now opened between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp. Formation of a Björk flap and transfer to a Rügheim cannula. Further ventilation is problem-free. Fixation of the cannula to the skin of the neck with 2 retaining threads. Now repositioning for tumor resection: After setting the tonsil stop, the tumor is now resected far into the healthy tissue with the electric knife, in some cases also sharply with the .................................... coagulation, initially from the anterior and posterior palatal arch, the cheek region is partly included and thus the tumor is resected far into the macroscopically healthy tissue. The tumor is detached from the hard palate with the freer, also from the mandible and traced further caudally into the depth of the lateral pharyngeal wall. Resection of the inner mandibular corticalis, which is sent with the tumor specimen. Now develop the entire tumor specimen transcervically and carefully stop the bleeding. Now take representative marginal samples from all 4 quadrants, which are found to be tumor-free in the frozen section assessment. Now reposition for radial artery flap harvesting: After abjuring and sterile draping, make an S-shaped incision from the antecubital region to the distal. Preparation of a skin graft corresponding to the defect and preservation of the same after preparation of a broad-lumen arterial connection and a venous drainage route. Inguinal skin harvesting: Spindle-shaped, adapted detachment of a full-thickness skin graft in the right inguinal region. Meticulous hemostasis and under slight tension, the primary wound closure is quite successful. A Redon drain is inserted beforehand. After irrigation with ............ solution of the graft, the forearm graft is subtly sutured into the defect. The superior thyroid artery is now dissected caudally transcervically and anastomosed to the arterial segment of the forearm flap. The venous segment is now connected with continuous suturing after selective ligation of several branches. There is very good perfusion without leakage. Intraoral control of the connected flap shows stable perfusion after pressure. In the meantime, long-term medication with the heparin perfusor is also started. Defect coverage of the forearm defect with the inguinal skin graft. Wound closure on both cervical sides after insertion of an 8-gauge Redon drain. After checking again that there is no bleeding in the flap area and perfusion, repositioning to remove a nasal atheroma: spindle-shaped skin incision with a skin spindle. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and removal of the atheroma in toto. Meticulous hemostasis using the above-mentioned skin spindle. In the absence of bleeding in the surgical area, wound closure with 5/0 Ethilon suture. Completion of the procedure after fixation of the tracheostoma on the cannula ligament. Check all drains.

The tumor originates from the medial hypopharyngeal wall, just extending laterally onto the arytenoid hump, but neither affecting the interary region nor the postcricoid. Laterally, the tumor extends in the entrance of the piriform recess along the anterior wall and just reaches the lateral side wall. The tumor is quite easy to move with the suction cup, in particular there is mobility towards the arytenoid cusp on the left. A deep infiltration of the cusp does not appear to be present here. The vocal cords are also clinically mobile on both sides. A PEG tube is inserted as part of the final esophagoscopy. The left-sided hypopharyngeal tumor is then adjusted with the Steiner tube. Adjustability is good. The tumor is then completely ablated with the CO2 laser under microscopic vision. The safety margin is at least 0.5 cm. The tumor can be easily removed from the deep layers, especially from the arytenoid cusp, in healthy tissue. Nevertheless, a final resection is taken from the left arytenoid hump and sent for final histology. Careful hemostasis. This is followed by repositioning for neck dissection, first on the left: For this, skin incision in a skin fold, 2 to 3 transverse fingers submandibularly. After skin incision, dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and exposure of the platysmal flap. Creation of platysmal flaps caudally and cranially.

Strict care is taken to ensure that the dissection is performed subperichondrally on the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage, thus sparing the piriform sinus as much as possible on both sides. Dissection of the prelaryngeal muscles at the level of the hyoid bone. Subsequent exposure of the free epiglottis margin and median pharyngotomy. Dissection along the lateral edge of the epiglottis on both sides and the aryepiglottic folds on both sides. Maximum protection of the pharyngeal mucosa in the area of the piriform sinus on both sides, transverse mucosal incision postcricoidally. Joining the lateral incision with this transverse incision and entering the region between the posterior wall of the trachea and the anterior wall of the oesophagus. Dissection caudally in this layer. Repeated hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Dissection of the thyroid gland from the side wall of the trachea on both sides, inspection of the specimen from the caudal side and easy removal of the specimen at the level of the already inserted tracheostoma. A tracheal cartilage clip is then resected and sent with the specimen for final histology. The anterior border samples are then taken: posterior edge of the tracheal sedimentation, postcricoid mucosa, medial wall of the right piriform sinus, medial wall of the left piriform sinus, base of the tongue. All marginal samples were found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleagues. Subsequently, cricopharyngeal myotomy in the typical manner. Subsequently, three-layer pharyngeal suture (thin submucosal connective tissue layer, transversely striated pharyngeal wall muscles, prelingual residual muscles). The pharyngeal suture is then reinforced using several cut pieces of Tachosil. Dry conditions. Placement of 2 Redon drains on both sides.

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment was indicated. Sonographically, a cN1 neck status on the right was suspected.","First confirmation of the extent. There is an exophytic tumor of the right tonsillar lobe, completely consuming the tonsillar lobe with transition to the soft palate up to the right-sided uvula base. In addition, the tumor extends slightly over the caudal tonsillar lobe, growth over the glossotonsillar groove to the free edge of the tongue on the right and here infiltration of an area of the tongue measuring approx. 3 cm with a penetration depth of approx. 1 cm. Infiltration also of the circumscribed posterior floor of the mouth. The PEG tube is inserted first. For this, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. With good diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach. The PEG tube is then inserted using the usual suture pull-through method. Transoral tumor resection is now performed. The tumor is cut around with a safety margin of 1 cm. Removal of the uvula and subtotal removal of the soft palate. Resection up to the buccal. Release of the tooth pocket of the posterior mandibular tooth; if close to the tumour, push off the periosteum here and thus achieve good mobilization in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth. The floor of the mouth is also resected with a safety margin of 1 cm. Resection of the tongue section with a safety margin of approx. 1.5 cm. Also safe in sano resection in depth. Basal resection up to the submandibular gland. The tumor area is now completely covered with marginal samples. These are all assessed as free of dysplasia and tumor. Only in the area of the base of the tongue is there an unclear change that cannot be further differentiated histologically. For this reason, a resection is performed later, which is again assessed as completely tumor-free and dysplasia-free. This results in a defect of the posterior floor of the mouth, the edge and base of the tongue, the lateral wall of the pharynx, the posterior wall of the pharynx and subtotally the soft palate. Therefore a clear indication for defect reconstruction. Neck dissection of the left side is performed first. To do this, make a skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid, digastric and omohyoid muscles. Exposure and release of the capsule of the submandibular gland. Subsequent evacuation of levels II a to V a with careful preservation of the facial vein, superior thyroid artery, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve as well as the cervical plexus branches. Final wound inspection. If the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Macroscopically, there are no suspicious nodules. Neck dissection is now performed on the opposite side. The procedure is basically the same here. However, in the area of the jugular facial angle, a coarse and therefore highly visible mass measuring approx. 2 cm can be seen. This can ultimately be extirpated while preserving the facial vein, without definite evidence of perinodal growth. Otherwise, after release of the submandibular gland, in addition to levels II a and V a, while sparing the structures already mentioned on the opposite side. Release of level I b. Here several macroscopic but not suspicious nodules. Subsequent extirpation of the gland. Partial resection of the digastric muscle and thus creation of a wide access to the enoral side, good overview. Protection of the hypoglossal nerve is possible. The radialis graft is now removed. After marking the graft specially configured for the tongue edge and soft palate, cut around the graft. Expose the cephalic vein. Exposure of the superficial ramus, radial nerve, which can be preserved. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle. Release of the radial artery. Strictly subfascial dissection. The cephalic vein shows no confluence with the deep venous system in the antecubital region, so it is clipped later and not used further. Exposure of a venous confluence and a further venous outflow. Exposure and preservation of the ulnar artery and common interosseous artery. Later, with a normal vital graft and normal blood supply to the hand, removal of the graft after ligation of the feeding and draining vessels. Careful hemostasis. Subsequent careful two-layer wound closure and insertion of the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the right groin. Application of the vacuum pump and application of the Cramer splint in the functional position for full-thickness skin harvesting from the right groin. For this purpose, cutting around an area of skin measuring a good 12 x 7 cm. Strict cutaneous elevation, subcutaneous mobilization. Insertion of a 10 Redon drain. Multi-layered subcutaneous wound closure and skin suture. The graft is now inserted. This is considerably more difficult due to the swelling that has now occurred. Overall, however, sufficient reconstruction of the defect is achieved, combined transorally and transcervically. Positioning of the stem. Preparation of the facial artery in the case of a very slender superior thyroid artery. Passage of the artery in anastomosis with 8-0 Ethilon. Finally, regular venous return via the draining veins. First condition the superior thyroid vein. Perform a venous anastomosis with the coupler system using a coupler size 3.0. There is now largely strong venous return via the second vein. The facial vein is therefore also conditioned and a further venous anastomosis is performed with the size 3.5 coupler. Regular circulation is then achieved. Positive smear tests and excellent graft perfusion, so that a size 10 Redon drain is subsequently inserted and the wound is closed in two layers. Due to the advanced swelling, a final protective tracheostomy is performed. This involves a skin incision at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and sucutaneous tissue. Entering the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior wall of the trachea. Dissection of the thin thyroid isthmus. Subsequent insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap. Subsequent problem-free transfer to a size 8 low-cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT3 cN1 oropharyngeal/oral cavity carcinoma on the right. If the graft heals properly and the graft is intact, a gradual diet can be started from the 8th postoperative day after inspection.

Injection of 5 ml Ultracaine with Suprarenin added. Cauterization and sterile draping. Incision between the cricoid cartilage and a point three transverse fingers above the jugulum measuring approx. 5 cm. Now cut through the skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma with a 15 mm scalpel. Enter with the pointed scissors and expose the infrahyoid musculature, linea alba and finally the thyroid gland. Incision with the Overholt clamp below the isthmus, the thyroid gland, between the thyroid gland and the trachea. Bipolar coagulation of the isthmus and transection of the isthmus. No injury to the surrounding structures. Truncus is checked or palpated and not injured. Now insertion between the second and retrotracheal ring and creation of a visor tracheotomy in the typical manner. The mucocutaneous anastomosis is performed without difficulty using Ethibond sutures. PEG insertion: Insertion with the flexible gastroesophagoscope and, under air insufflation, pre-scanning into the stomach. Gastric mucosa unremarkable, without irritation. Inversion shows no tumor in the cardia. A spontaneous diaphanoscopy is performed in loco typico, paramedian left, three transverse fingers below the ribs. A PEG is then inserted at this site using the thread pull-through method without any problems. Traction loosening should take place in 24 hours. The patient received Unacid 3 g i.v. perioperatively. Tumor resection and neck dissection on the left. After positioning and sterile washing and draping of the patient, insertion of the McIvor mouth blocker and inspection of the tumor region. The tumor extends from the left tonsil onto the anterior palatal arch up to the uvula and caudally to the glossotonsillar groove and the base of the tongue. The resection is first started with the monopolar needle in the area of the soft palate. Safety distance 1 to 1.5 cm. The entire anterior palatal arch must be removed. Then move on to the tonsil region. Further dissection with scissors and bipolar forceps so that the tonsil is removed together with the tumor tissue. The musculature must also be removed in depth and the soft tissues of the neck are accessed. The neck fat becomes visible. Then further dissection in the area of the glossotonsillar groove and the base of the tongue, part of the base of the tongue is also removed. Medially, the largest parts of the posterior palatal arch are also removed due to tumor infiltration. The specimen is placed on cork for frozen section. The frozen section still shows moderate dysplasia in the area of the soft palate. A superficial resection is performed and a marginal sample is sent to the frozen section. This is then tumor-free. Then transition to neck dissection on the left side. Skin incision in a transverse skin fold. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Removal of the neck preparation II a to V a, sparing the plexus branches. The accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve are exposed and spared. Now widen the opening enorally so that 3 transverse fingers can be comfortably inserted into the mouth area. The flap pedicle is to be pulled through here later. Now dissect the connecting vessels. Dissection of the superior thyroid and facial vein as well as the external jugular vein. The patient has a good vascular situation and several options for connection. Radialis flap: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap boundaries (size) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Covering of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Neck dissection on the right: injection of 10 ml Suprarenin along the skin incision on the front edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. Use the 15 mm scalpel to sharply cut through the skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma. The external jugular vein is now ligated. The ramus auricularis magnus is severed. Dissection of the platysma flap and dissection along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. The accessorius nerve is explored cranially. The nerve can be visualized without difficulty. The nerve is traced cranially to the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. The posterior belly of the GSM is also visualized. The omohyoid muscle is dissected and traced cranially. The jugular vein is now dissected from caudal to cranial. Level II b is detached, followed by II a, III, IV and V in depth. The ACC and the vagus nerve are exposed and spared. The anterior neck preparation is detached from the internal jugular vein and facial vein without any problems. The hypoglossal nerve is exposed and spared. Hemostasis using bipolar forceps. At the end of the procedure, there is no bleeding. Placement of a 10 Redon drain. Platysma suture using 4.0 Vicryl and skin suture using 4.0 Ethilon. The nervus accessorius showed an anatomical variant and ran above the jugular vein. The nerve was also spared. After removal of the graft, it is rinsed with heparin, then the flap is sutured into the defect: first sutures are placed, the graft is inserted and the pedicle is passed through the large tunnel. The flap is successively sutured into the defect with 3-0 Vicryl single-button sutures, folded in the palatal arch area. This results in tension-free, complete defect coverage. The superior thyroid artery and radial artery are then conditioned for vascular anastomosis. This is performed with 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. Subsequent conditioning of the veins, here conditioning of the two outflows from the superficial venous system. The deep venous system is clipped in the course of the operation. Two outlets of the facial vein are selected, the larger outlet is anastomosed with the larger outlet of the cephalic vein after conditioning the veins using a 3-0 vascular coupler. Here, after opening the clamp, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The smaller vein with a smaller outlet from the facial vein is then anastomosed using a 2-0 coupler. Here too, after opening the clamp, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. Subsequent irrigation of the wound area. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain on the right and 2 flaps on the left. Subsequently, after epithelialization of the tracheostoma, fixation of the cannula using sutures. Close inspection of the flap. This is vital. The procedure is then completed without complications. The patient is ventilated postoperatively for monitoring in the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics, which were started intraoperatively with Unacid, for 1 week. Continue heparin perfusor 500 units per hour for a total of 5 days. Flap control according to the scheme for 5 days, both clinically and by Doppler sonography. A suture marker was placed on the left side of the neck for this purpose. Feeding via the PEG tube for approx. 10 days, then gruel swallowing and, if necessary, diet build-up. After receiving the final histology, presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference to plan further treatment.","Tumor tonsillectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Then, entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the tumor. The tumor starts at the lower edge of the left tonsil and extends over the entire oropharyngeal side wall on the left side to the left vallecula and epiglottis edge, then sterile washing and draping and insertion of a Mc Ivor mouth block and start with a transoral tumor resection with a safety margin of 1 cm to 1.5 cm. Then repositioning for neck dissection on the left side. Skin incision at the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid of the submandibular gland, the digaster and the accessorius nerve, exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and exposure of the internal jugular vein. It becomes clear that there is a metastasis in level II that cannot be separated from the internal jugular vein, so the neck dissection is temporarily stopped on the left side and the procedure is switched to the opposite side so that the internal jugular vein can be safely preserved there. Here also skin incision in the usual manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle, the accessorius nerve, release of the medial neck block while sparing the facial vein. Then release of the neck block in levels IIb, III and IV while sparing the plexus branches. The internal jugular vein can be completely preserved. Now switch back to the left side and complete the neck dissection on this side while ligating and repositioning the internal jugular vein so that the metastasis in level II can be safely removed. Release the neck blocks IIb, III, IV and Va while sparing the plexus branches. The facial vein, which in this patient originates very far caudally from the internal jugular vein, can be preserved. The superior thyroid artery can also be preserved. Then remove the submandibular gland while sparing the lingual nerve and the lingual artery. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle and creation of an enoral access. Further tumor resection from the transoral side. The tumor can be retrieved en bloc and is suture-marked for frozen section. There is still carcinoma in situ on the posterior pharyngeal wall towards the medial side. Here, another large resection is performed and a final margin sample is taken. The final marginal sample R0, finally all R0. Lifting of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The radialis graft is lifted 9 x 7 cm, from the left side. To do this, first mark the graft and the skin incision on the forearm up to the elbow. Then make a skin incision in the marked area, expose the venous plexus in the elbow area, then expose the brachioradialis muscle. Visualization of the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve, then visualization of the superficial ramus, the radial nerve with its branches. Locate the radial artery, clamp the radial artery using a vascular clip for 10 minutes. The connected pulse oximeter shows a continuous 100 % oxygen saturation, so that the radial artery can finally be severed and stitched with an overlocking suture. The radialis graft is then lifted off the tendons while sparing the ulnar artery and the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Dissect the pedicle cranially while clipping off the branches. A superficial and a deep vein are taken from the venous system with good confluence. Deposition of the radialis graft first in the venous limb, here it becomes apparent that only the deep vein conveys blood to the outside, the superficially prepared vessel does not convey blood and probably cannot be used for anastomosis. Now the arterial limb is removed and the radialis graft is fitted into the defect. This is very difficult as the defect is three-dimensional and sutures must be placed transcervically and the graft sutured in place. The rest is sutured in from the transoral side. This is again very difficult on the posterior pharyngeal wall in the cranial region, as the defect also extends very far towards the border of the nasopharynx due to the resection. Then preparation of the blood vessels. The superior thyroid artery is prepared as the artery and the facial vein as the vein. Now perform the arterial anastomosis in the usual manner with Ethilon 8-0 and then the venous anastomosis with a size 3.5 coupler. Insertion of a Redon drainage very far dorsally and two-layer wound closure on both sides. A Redon drain was also inserted on the right side. A tracheotomy was performed at the same time as the flap was lifted. Skin incision below the cricoid cartilage, separation of the fatty tissue, then exposure of the musculature and the linea alba, splitting of the musculature in the linea alba. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus, visualization of the anterior wall of the trachea. Entering the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. No Björk flap is created and later reintubation to a tracheal cannula 9.0 without any problems. The split skin is also removed from the right thigh at the same time as the graft is lifted; this is then sutured to the forearm in the usual way and a dorsal forearm splint is fitted. The patient is ventilated in the intensive care unit, given antibiotics for at least 24 hours and the flap is checked according to the usual schedule.","Resection, Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

The carcinoma at the base of the tongue showed deep ulceration, so that defect coverage using a radial flap was indicated.","Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Transoral tumor resection: insertion of rubber-reinforced wound blockers. Attachment of the tongue with a reining suture. Now a good overview of the tongue. The tumor is now resected far into the healthy tissue, at least 2 cm to all sides. This results in an almost complete hemi-glossectomy on the right, parts of the floor of the mouth as well as the sublingual gland and the sublingual/submandibular gland at the back are also removed. The lingual nerve is included in the resection. The tumor is thread-marked and sent for a frozen section. In the frozen section to all sides in healthy tissue, thus R0 resection. PEG insertion: Advancement of the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach. After creating a diaphanoscopy, placement of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube in a typical manner without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall. After patho-histological confirmation of the R0 resection, transfer to neck dissection on both sides: skin disinfection both in the head/neck area on both sides as well as the left forearm and right groin. Injection of a total of 20 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline in the area of both sides of the neck. Start of neck dissection on the left: Curved skin incision in a neck fold or along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Subsequent exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the digastric muscle and submandibular gland. The capsule is also removed in the caudal region. Subsequent exposure of the internal and external carotid artery, internal jugular vein and facial vein. Dissection and exposure, neurolysis and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve, accessorius nerve, vagus nerve, cervical artery and superficial branches of the cervical plexus. Successive clearing of levels II-IV. In the anterior neck area, the facial artery, the superior thyroid artery and the superior thyroid vein are exposed and preserved. Neck dissection on the right side: This is performed in the same way as on the left side. Level II-IV evacuation in the same way. In addition, level Ib excision including the submandibular gland and the sublingual gland. Both structures were resected as part of the tumor resection, here also with resection of the lingual nerve. Dissection and exposure, neurolysis and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve, accessorius nerve, vagus nerve and cervical nerve. The hypoglossal nerve is preserved here, as on the opposite side. Slightly enlarged lymph nodes on the right more than on the left, no significant signs of metastasis macroscopically. Removal of the forearm flap: marking of the skin island of approx. 5x8 cm. Apply a tourniquet. Cut around the skin island subfascially, incision up to the crook of the elbow in a curved manner. Exposure of the superficial venous system. Successive development of the radialis flap subfascially also from the radial side. Preservation of the antebrachial nerve if it does not run into the flap. Caudal clipping of veins. Exposure of the radial artery. This is clamped and supplied using 4.0 Prolene puncture ligatures, whereby a .................... suture to the skin area is also made in the flap area. The flap is then lifted subfascially under the vascular pedicle Outgoing vessels are clipped. Dissection up to the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the connection between the deep and superficial system. Outgoing veins are clipped. The artery is very thin. Therefore, dissection up to the division of the radial and ulnar arteries. Exposure of the confluence of the radial artery. Exposure of the cephalic vein. Now open the tourniquet. Good perfusion of the flap. Hemostasis again. Deposition of the flap on the cephalic vein, which is ligated cranially at the confluence of the radial vein, which is ligated cranially and shortly after the exit from the brachial artery, which is supplied by means of a clip and puncture ligatures. Subsequently good further perusion of the ulnar artery. Irrigation of the flap with heparin solution. Flap is voluminous overall due to the very thick subcutaneous layer. Subsequent insertion of the flap into the defect. Enlarge the tunnel again until it is three transverse fingers wide and one transverse finger high. The pedicle can be inserted through the tunnel into the soft tissues of the neck. Suture the flap, creating a slight tension through the thick subcutaneous layer. The flap is trimmed anteriorly in the area of the tip of the tongue. Complete defect coverage. The flap was partially sutured in place with sutures. Subsequent vascular anastomosis. Trimming of the superior thyroid artery and the radial artery. Suturing of these with 9.0 Ethilon. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and good venous return. Then suture the cephalic vein at an outlet from the relatively thick facial vein. Select a 3 mm outlet for this purpose. The confluence of the radial vein is treated with clips. In the area of the facial vein, the cranial parts were ligated or supplied with clips. The distal superior thyroid artery was also supplied with clips. With good arterial flow, the alignment test shows good venous return. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Irrigation of the wound area on both sides. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain on both sides. The wound in the forearm area was closed with full-thickness skin. A piece of full-thickness skin of the appropriate size was removed from the groin for this purpose. After mobilization of the skin edges and subcutaneous tissue, the groin is now closed in layers with minimal tension. The skin is closed using back-stitch sutures and a Redon drain is inserted. The forearm is closed in layers in the proximal area. The full-thickness skin from the groin is sutured into the defect. Complete closure of the defect. A Mepilex hydrogel dressing is then applied. Wölckchen compresses are then applied. The arm is then wrapped with absorbent cotton and a splint is fitted. Fixation of the arm to the Cramer splint with a loose bandage. Forearm always well supplied with blood after flap removal. Due to the situation of significant swelling in the tongue/oral cavity area, decision to perform a temporary tracheotomy: Kocher's collar incision. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue up to the infrahyoid musculature. Division of these. Splitting of the very small thyroid isthmus after bipolar coagulation. Mobilization of the caudal skin. Subsequent creation of a small broad pedunculated Björk flap. Epithelialization of this in the typical manner with thibond sutures. Insertion of a 7 mm tracheal cannula. This is fixed with sutures. Slit compresses are applied to the inserted Redon drains, otherwise no further dressing. The site suitable for Doppler control was marked with a thread, right cervical. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue intraoperative antibiotics for approx. 1 week. Also continue heparin therapy, which was started intraoperatively at 500 I.U./hour. Flap control according to the scheme for 5 days. Nutrition via the inserted PEG tube for approx. 7-10 days.

The above-mentioned procedure should therefore be performed.,"First alcohol disinfection. Application of local anesthesia. Apron-like skin incision. Subcutaneous preparation. Neck dissection is then performed on the left side. To do this, first expose the internal jugular vein, the accessorius nerve, the digastric muscle, the vagus nerve, the external and internal carotid artery. Then successive development of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the above-mentioned structures. Development of the medial neck preparation, also sparing the above-mentioned structures. Now repositioning for neck dissection on the right side. Infiltration, at least of the internal jugular vein. For this reason, the cranial and caudal ends of the internal jugular vein are exposed first. This is ligated. Then visualization of the accessorius nerve and the digastric muscle. Here it is already suspected that the accessor nerve is infiltrated by a large lymph node metastasis. This also infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The tumor block is now dissected laterally from the medial side along the external and internal carotid artery. During further dissection and visualization of the vagus nerve, this is also infiltrated at approximately the level of the carotid bifurcation and is therefore included. The tumor or neck preparation is then developed and removed, taking parts of the sternocleidomastoid muscle with it and partially taking the omohyoid muscle with it. Careful hemostasis, left and right. Now development of the larynx preparation. To do this, first expose the hyoid bone and the thyroid cartilage. Separation of the pharyngeal muscles from the thyroid cartilage on both sides. A tracheotomy is then performed beforehand. This involves cutting through the thyroid isthmus. This is stitched and then a tracheotomy is performed between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp. First incision of the caudal skin flap. Further development of the LE preparation. For this purpose, release of the piriform sinus on both sides. Then release the epiglottis at the free edge of the epiglottis. Then entering the pharyngeal tube and successive excision of the laryngeal preparation along the aryepiglottic fold. Incision united posteriorly postcricoidally. Detachment of the postcricoid mucosa, which is not affected by the cricoid cartilage plate. Further detachment of the laryngeal preparation. Separation in the area of the trachea and removal of the entire preparation for frozen section diagnostics. The edges of the incision are found to be tumor-free. Now rinse thoroughly. Cut through the pharyngeal muscles or the esophageal sphincter. Insertion of a Provox prosthesis 4 to 5 mm above the edge of the tracheal incision. This is successful without any problems. Then multi-layered, inverting pharyngeal suture. Readaptation of the infrahyoid muscles at the hyoid bone after subtle hemostasis has been performed.

This was confirmed histologically. In addition, there is a simultaneous histologically confirmed hilar bronchial carcinoma. B-scan ultrasonography revealed a cN0 neck status. A CT scan was performed and a cT2-3 glottic carcinoma on the right was suspected, with no definite evidence of cartilage infiltration. The patient was informed in detail about the treatment options, surgery and radiotherapy. It was discussed in detail that a complete removal of the larynx may be necessary. The patient wishes to avoid this as far as possible. There is a history of occlusion of the right carotid artery in 1997 with apoplexy and hemiparesis on the left. This is also shown on CT. Based on the medical history and clinical findings, indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","Transfer of the patient to the operating theater. Followed by active patient identification. Consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Carrying out the team time-out. Two ECs in the blood bank. Induction of anesthesia and tracheo-bronchoscopy with 0° optics by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. This revealed the previously described finding of an exophytic mass of the entire vocal fold on the right side that extends subglottically and the anterior commissure could not be seen completely. Due to the extension, especially to the subglottic side, a partial laryngectomy, if necessary, was decided in the tumor conference. This is confirmed here. Now intubation by the anesthetist. Head positioning by the surgeon. Discussion of the skin incision with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Skin disinfection and infiltration anesthesia in the area of the planned skin incision and 10 ml Ultracaine. Skin disinfection and sterile draping of the surgical site. Marking of the landmarks of the jugulum, incisura thyroidea, cricoid cartilage and the central chin. Draw the skin incision from the hyoid bone in a zigzag shape running caudally in a skin fold, just below the cricoid cartilage. Now make the skin incision using a scalpel and cut through the subcutaneous and cutaneous tissue. Expose the platysma. Dissection of the platysma and subplatysmal preparation. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Enter the median plane and expose and dissect the thyroid cartilage as well as the ligamentum conicum, cricothyroid muscle and the ring button. Subsequent dissection of the perichondrium. An incision is made in the right paramedian using a scalpel. Then form a posteriorly pedicled periosteal flap to the right and left. Then open the thyroid cartilage paramedian on the left using a wheel. Prior to this, horizontal entry into the conic ligament with the scissors. Ensure that a sufficient piece of ligamentum conicum remains caudal to the thyroid cartilage for subsequent suturing. Now dissect alternately with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Endolaryngeal lumen is exposed. This shows the exophytic tumor, which occupies the entire right vocal fold and extends into the anterior commissure as well as subglottically and into the morgue sinus. First, the tumor is dissected subperiosteally on the left side using a Freer and the tumor is placed at a safe distance in the anterior third of the left vocal fold. Subperichondrial dissection is then performed on the right side using Freer until just before the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage. Ventrally, there is a questionable erosion of the thyroid cartilage, so saw it out as a triangular wedge on the right side. After further caudal dissection, the tumor can be completely resected down to the cricoid cartilage using a Freer and then using scissors down to the subglottic level. This is then thread-marked (vocal fold on the left, cranial sinus morgagni, caudal subglottic, dorsal posterior arytenoid and wound bed) for frozen section. The frozen section shows that the wound bed is just R0 and just reaches the resection margins in the area of the ary. For this reason, a resection is performed in the area of the wound bed between the cricoid cartilage and thyroid cartilage, which also goes to the frozen section. This is ultimately free. In addition, a resection and then a further marginal sample, dorsal ary, is again sent to the frozen section. This again shows CIS. Therefore, after demonstrating the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME> and as the patient wanted to avoid a laryngectomy if possible and had no previous history of swallowing problems, another resection was performed. The vocal process of the arytenoid is also resected. This is repeated as a resection for the frozen section. Finally, a third marginal sample is taken by skeletonizing the arytenoid up to the interary area. This ultimately reveals an R0 situation in the frozen section. Targeted and intensive hemostasis is then performed. Between the frozen section breaks and due to the tumor extension to the subglottic area, a tracheotomy is performed. This involves exposing the bovine cartilage. Undermining of the isthmus of the thyroid gland. This is narrow and thin. Therefore, successive coagulation of the same and transection of the same and exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. The skin was mobilized up to the jugulum and the incision widened again. Then, entry and identification between the second and third cricoid cartilage. Creation of tracheostomy sutures in the sense of caudal back-stitch sutures, as there are two in total, and two sutures cranially and reintubation. Now <CLINICIAN_NAME> recommends a selective neck dissection level II to IV due to the extent of the tumor in the sense of a transglottic carcinoma from supraglottic to subglottic. This is also performed during the frozen section break. To do this, mark the landmarks of the mastoid and sternocleidomastoid anterior margin on the right side and mark the skin incision. Then cut through the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma using a scalpel. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid anterior margin. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, which crosses over the jugular vein. Dissection on the sterno caudally and exposure and sparing of the accissor nerve. The neck is short overall and contains a lot of fatty tissue. Therefore difficult dissection conditions. Exposure of the course of the omohyoid muscle from caudal to cranial. Meticulous care is taken not to make any connection to the other surgical site. Exposure of the caudal belly of the submandibular salivary gland. Exposure of the digaster venter anterior muscle up to the omo. Exposure of the digaster venter posterior muscle up to the jugular vein. This is also visualized from caudal to cranial up to the junction with the digaster venter posterior muscle. Here the medial neck preparation is very voluminous. During careful dissection in this area, between the jugular vein and the digaster venter posterior muscle, i.e. medial/cranial to the internal jugular vein, there is an injury to an arterial vessel despite digital palpation. This was found not to be pulsating on palpation. Further dissection of this vessel revealed that it was a completely sclerosed internal carotid artery. Due to its kinking, in the sense of a vascular anomaly, it lies medially cranial to the internal jugular vein. There is no bleeding here as it is completely sclerosed. The vascular surgeon <CLINICIAN_NAME> is called in immediately. The pupils are equal at all times. The colleague confirms on CT that the internal carotid artery is completely occluded just above the bifurcation. She then completely transected the internal carotid artery. This shows that there is no reflux or flow. She ligated the cranial end and made several stitches around the caudal end using a prolene. This concludes the procedure. Now expose the hypoglossal nerve and the vagus nerve. Both are spared. Expose the facial vein and the cervical vein from caudal to cranial. The medial neck preparation is now removed. The superior thyroid artery is also exposed and spared. The vagus nerve and the accessorius nerve are exposed. The lateral neck preparation level V is left in place. Then, after insertion of a Redon and suturing of the same, two-layer wound closure. This was preceded by irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's. Another meticulous inspection of the surgical site. This is completely dry, after still occasional targeted bipolar coagulation. Then two-layer wound closure using subcutaneous suture and cutaneous suture. Finally, after re-inspection of the laryngeal site and bipolar coagulation, supra-tip swabs are inserted. For closure, the edges of the larynx are very well adapted using 4.0 Vicryl with three sutures. The perichondrium suture is then applied. This is placed completely over the larynx and closes it completely and very well. The coniotomy is also closed. This results in a very good aspect. Insertion of a narrow flap between the thyroid cartilage and the infrahyoid muscles. This is now also sutured successively from cranial to caudal over the thyroid cartilage using single button sutures, so that this is very well covered and there is no indication of a fistula. Subcutaneous suture, including the platysma, and cutaneous suture. Intraoperative administration of clindamycin and reintubation with a seven-gauge Rüsch cannula. Application of a pressure bandage. Intraoperative until the end of the operation, pupils equal and narrow on both sides. Now end of the procedure. The patient goes to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Conclusion: Postoperative administration of Clindamycin 4 x 600 mg over 24 hours. Continue with pressure bandage. A nasogastric tube was placed. Ligation of the ACI on the right in a complete stenosis that had been present for 20 years in post-apoplexy on the right with hemiparesis on the left. Check of the neurological status. Please note the final histology. Presentation at the tumor conference and clarification of the procedure regarding the bronchial carcinoma.","Partial laryngeal resection, Visor tracheotomy, Selective neck dissection

Emergency intervention already <2012>. <2012> the panendoscopy was performed to plan the surgical procedure and the PEG was placed. CT scan and clinically extensive laryngeal destruction with extensive growth per continuitatem in the soft tissues of the neck on the left. The multimorbid patient has a pronounced peripheral arterial occlusive disease with a history of leg amputation on both sides.,"After intubation via the supine tracheostoma and preparation by the anesthesia colleagues, a pharyngo/laryngoscopy was first performed. As described above, the tumor was found in the area of the left hypopharynx with extensive laryngeal destruction, extensive postcricoid growth towards the esophageal opening and extending directly in front of it. Growth towards the crania, also into the pre-epiglottic fatty tissue. Fixation of the hyoid on the right side, free conditions, with the tumor clearly reaching the midline, especially in the caudal transition. Inspection of the tracheostoma: the tracheostoma is reddened peristomally. Close inspection reveals a suspicious lesion in the area of the mucocutaneous anastomosis on the left side. This is a growth in the area of the tracheostoma. Therefore, skin incision to the apron flap with complete circumcision of the tracheostoma. Elevation of the apron flap with elevation of the platysma. Elevation of the platysma. First expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side, expose the omohyoid muscle of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle and initial attempt to visualize the laryngeal skeleton. This shows that the laryngeal skeleton on the right side has also been penetrated by tumor. Therefore, a muscular cuff was then left in place. Exposure and release of the hyoid on the right side. Ligation of the upper laryngeal bundle. Exposure and separation of the entire cervical vascular sheath. Dissection down to the prevertebral fascia. Mobilization of the larynx from the prevertebral fascia. This shows no infiltration by the tumor. Then, after complete loosening of the soft tissue on the right side, entry on the left side. This reveals infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and tumor infiltration of the right-sided cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Exposure and later ligation of the facial vein. Release of the sternocleidomastoid muscle cranially and caudally in the area of origin. Exposure and later removal of the accessorius nerve. Removal of the neck preparation. Here complete. First expose the internal jugular vein cranially and caudally. Release of the cervical part of the tumor, including level V and partial revision of the cervical plexus. Despite the previous mobilization of the surrounding tissue, there is now evidence of widespread infiltration of the cervical vascular sheath. Therefore now careful opening. Exposure of the common carotid artery and cranial dissection. Exposure of the vagus nerve. Tumor growth is now clearly visible in the internal jugular vein. This is therefore removed cranially and caudally. In addition, there is a small growth on the vagus nerve and a circumscribed macroscopic change in the nerve. In addition, direct infiltration of the perivascular tissue of the common carotid artery with detachment of the perivascular tissue. The tumor can now be separated by initially bluntly detaching the vagus nerve. A marginal sample was taken in the area of the common carotid artery on the detached perivascular tissue, also in the marginal area of the vagus nerve. Clear cranial infiltration of the superior thyroid artery, which is separated. The further course of the external carotid artery is now free, so that after visualization and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve, no extension of the radicality is required here. In the frozen section diagnostics, the marginal samples in the area of the vagus nerve as well as in the area of the common carotid artery are now tumor positive. Therefore, after discussing the case and demonstrating the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, long-distance resection of the vagus nerve and resection of the remaining perivascular connective tissue, but with preservation of the actual vessel wall. The vagus nerve is resected in an elongated fashion and sent for definitive histology. The post-resectate in the area of the common carotid artery is assessed as tumor-free. Exposure of the prevertebral fascia and complete detachment of the pharyngeal tube. Left-sided partial thyroidectomy also on the right side with adherence to the tumor DD scarred by the tracheotomy. Complete incision of the tracheostoma. Exposure of the trachea caudally, which is macroscopically and palpatorily free. Now turn to definitive tumor resection. To do this, enter above the hyoid on the right side, enter the right-sided vallecula, snare the epiglottis, widen the pharyngotomy. Resection along the right aryepiglottic fold. Due to the extensive laryngeal infiltration, the right-sided piriform sinus can only be partially released. Significant extensive postcricoid growth, here growing submucosally. Therefore, the entire postcricoid region must also be resected. As described above, the tumor can be seen in the area of the left piriform sinus as well as the left pharyngeal wall, in some cases extending to the midline. Excision of the tumor with a safety margin of approx. 1 cm, macroscopically in sano, macroscopically altered parts of the pharynx were removed. After removal, a caudal complete pharyngotomy with circular pharyngeal resection is performed; cranially, an approx. 2-5 cm wide pharyngeal strip can be preserved. Completely imaged marginal samples are now taken from the entire area of the detached mucosa as well as in the area of the base of the tongue and towards the esophagus. A marginal sample is also taken in the area of the separated trachea and in the area of the peristomally separated skin. These are diagnosed as completely tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics, so that a local R0 situation can be assumed overall. Now complete the neck dissection of the right side. Due to the tumor resection, an extended radical neck dissection of the left side was performed en bloc on the specimen. Complete exposure of the digastric muscle on the right side. Exposure of the accessory nerve, exposure of the internal jugular vein, exposure and preservation of the facial vein, exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Dissection of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Dissection of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Finally, the defect is measured when the wound is dry. Due to the highly critical vascular supply and the radical resection, microvascular reconstruction is not performed. Elevation of a pedicled pectoralis major graft measuring up to 14 x 9 cm in total from the left. For this purpose, marking of the flap for complete pharyngeal reconstruction and marking of a temporary deltopectoral flap. This is lifted up to the 2nd angiosome, strictly subfascial preparation. Incision of the pectoralis major flap. Broad-based caudal dissection up to the rectus aponeurosis. Release of the pectoralis major muscle. Suture fixation of the muscle to the skin island. Cranial dissection strictly subfascial including the pectoralis major muscle. Exposure of the pectoralis minor muscle and the pedicle vessels. Subsequent resection of the muscle, leaving a cuff around the vascular pedicle. Cranial complete release of the pedicle vessel to allow maximum rotation and maximum freedom from tension. Creation of a wide cervical skin tunnel. Complete tension-free placement and insertion into the pharyngeal defect. A nasogastric tube was previously inserted into the separated esophagus. The surrounding skin is then carefully and extensively mobilized pectorally. Careful hemostasis. Subsequent strong and multi-layered wound closure after insertion of two 10-gauge Redon drains. Resection of protruding skin and subsequent repositioning of the temporarily elevated deltopectoral flap. Cervically, the graft is successively sutured to the separated esophagus under visualization. Strictly inverting suture at the mucosal level. Reanastomosis of the caudal part of the pharynx into the esophageal reconstruction to avoid subsequent stenosis, successive incorporation of the graft. Final good fit. Creation of a wide pharyngeal tube as well as intact and tight conditions on all sides with the flap in proper vitality. After final wound inspection, the tracheostoma is sutured and a 10-gauge Redon drainage tube is inserted and the wound is carefully closed in two layers. Re-intubation onto a 12 Rüsch cannula, which is suture-fixed, and completion of the procedure at this point. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g, which should be continued for 24 hours postoperatively. Careful postoperative wound control in case of high risk of fistula due to complete pharyngectomy. Overall intraoperatively, a narrow R0 situation can be assumed in the area of the left common carotid artery, with overall extensive findings of a cT4a cN0 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the left. In the case of regular wound conditions, an X-ray pre-swallow was performed on the 10th postoperative day.","Pharyngolaryngotomy

Attempt to adjust the tumor, which can be seen on the left side in the area of the glottis and supraglottis. Adjustment of the tumor is extremely difficult as the adjustability is very low. CT morphologically, the tumor breaks through the thyroid cartilage. Placement of a nasogastric tube. Repositioning for PEG insertion. Entering with the flexible esophagoscope and advancing into the stomach. Insertion of a PEG using the thread pull-through method. With good diaphanoscopy, this can be done without any problems. Sterile washing and draping. Creation of an apron flap. Preparation of the platysma. Raising and fixation of the apron flap. Start with the neck dissection on the left side. Here you can see a large rough metastasis which macroscopically infiltrates far into the sternocleidomastoid. Therefore, expose the sternocleidomastoid and the submandibular gland, the omohyoid muscle and remove the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the caudal region. Raise the muscle and dissect along the cervical vascular sheath in a cranial direction. It can be clearly seen that the internal jugular vein has a very small caliber, so that it can be assumed that the tumor has also penetrated the vein. This also becomes clear on further dissection. The vein is therefore clamped and cut in the caudal area and the ends are ligated. Further dissection cranially along the external and internal carotid artery. The metastasis can be easily pushed away from these vessels. The metastasis also infiltrates the posterior digastric venter muscle. This is also partially removed. The hypoglossal nerve can be spared and the facial vein must unfortunately also be removed. Removal of the metastasis and removal of the legal neck block II a to V a, sparing the plexus branches, whereby it must be said that the accessorius nerve and the cranial plexus branches were also partially resected, as these have penetrated directly into the metastasis. Turning to the opposite side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid, digastric and submandibular gland and exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein, the facial vein and removal of the neck levels II a to V a, while sparing the plexus branches. Detachment of the neck vessels from the pharynx and larynx area. Exposure of the hyoid bone. Detachment of the base of the tongue from the hyoid bone. Skeletonization of the larynx with detachment of the oblique laryngeal musculature. Entering the pharynx, just above the hyoid bone. Pulling out the epiglottis and cutting along the epiglottis to the postcricoid region, initially on the right side. Inspection of the tumor region. This breaks through the thyroid cartilage ventrally and also laterally on the left. A great deal of tissue is left in the ventral and lateral region of the laryngeal preparation. The thyroid gland is difficult to dissect and is therefore sharply dissected to avoid getting into the tumor. Further dissection of the laryngeal preparation and removal of the larynx below the cricoid cartilage. Before this, a tracheostoma was created and the ventilation tube was intubated. Removal of a resected specimen with a marginal sample from the thyroid gland area, as the tumor is at least very close here macroscopically. The marginal sample from the thyroid gland is tumor-free. The laryngeal specimen is sent for final histology. Insertion of a Provox prosthesis in the usual manner with the auxiliary trocar, approx. 1 cm below the upper edge of the tracheostoma. A myotomy of the esophageal sphincter is omitted, as this could be passed loosely with a transverse finger. Perform a myotomy in the sternocleidomastoid muscle to achieve a flat stoma.

An attempt is first made to intubate bronchoscopically. This is not possible due to the large tumor masses. The bronchoscope cannot pass through the tumor masses and the glottis. Therefore withdrawal and decision for tracheotomy in LA. Ultracaine is injected in the tracheotomy area. Then a skin incision is made slightly below the cricoid cartilage, dissected in depth down to the prelaryngeal muscles. This is pushed to the side. Then dissection down to the thyroid gland. Exposure of the thyroid gland. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea and entry into the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Insertion of a laryngectomy tube and repositioning in preparation for surgery. Then sterile washing and draping. Creation of an apron flap in the usual manner, while protecting the platysma. Start with neck dissection/tumor resection on the left side. This reveals a very large metastasis that initially appears to be attached to the larynx and merges into the tumor per continuitatem. This metastasis is first detached from the cervical vascular sheath. It can be seen that the internal jugular vein runs directly into the metastasis. This must be cut off. The common carotid artery, the external carotid artery and the internal carotid artery can be detached from the metastasis, as can the vagus nerve. Most of the sternocleidomastoid muscle must also be removed, but the outer layers of the muscle can be preserved and the accessorius nerve also preserved, as there is clearly no tumor infiltration here. Exposure of the hyoid bone. Then release of the larynx and detachment of the cervical vascular sheath, also on the right side. Detachment of the suprahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone and opening of the pharynx at the exact point of the epiglottis. Pull out the epiglottis and incise the pharynx downwards along the free edge of the epiglottis. The tumor can be easily palpated macroscopically and the tumor is resected up to the posterior side of the pharynx, leaving a sufficient safety margin in the pharynx. Then release the piriform sinus on the right side and complete the tumor resection and laryngectomy by cutting around the pharynx and piriform sinus from the opposite side. Then the laryngeal preparation is also removed posteriorly below the cricoid cartilage so that a good tongue-shaped flap can remain on the posterior wall of the trachea. Now demonstrate the entire preparation on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and also on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. It is recommended not to perform a flapplasty as sufficient mucosal tissue is present. Due to the good safety distance, it is possible to take margin samples directly from the specimen without any problems. The specimen is completely covered by margin samples and cut around. The pathologist classifies everything in the frozen section as R0. Then insertion of a voice valve prosthesis in the usual manner by creating a tracheoesophageal fistula using the trocar provided for this purpose. The voice valve prosthesis is then inserted using the pull-through method and the edges are carefully rolled out. The Provox prosthesis is positioned approx. 1 cm below the tracheostoma. Now perform the pharyngeal suture in the usual way, starting at the top at the base of the tongue. Then switch to the distal area and place the 1st suture, then place the 2nd suture. Then complete the neck dissection in level V on the left side. Then perform the modified radical neck dissection on the right side levels II to IV using <CLINICIAN_NAME>. For this, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is further released, the accessorius is exposed, the hypoglossus is exposed, the neck preparation is released from the neck vessel sheath and removed. Now perform the 3rd safety suture, fixation of the constrictor pharyngeal muscle. Finally, incision and completion of the tracheostoma with formation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis. Two Redon drains were inserted and a two-layer wound closure was made. Please X-ray pap smear examination after 10 days, then, if there is no fistula, problem-free, step-by-step diet reconstruction and presentation of the patient to the tumor conference to plan adjuvant therapy.","Partial pharyngectomy with laryngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Provox

As described above, an approx. 3 x 2 cm large mass can be seen in the right hypopharynx, which was positively biopsied as a squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor appears to be resectable by lateral pharyngotomy. The PEG is now initially inserted: the esophagoscope is inserted into the stomach. Due to the thickness of the subcutaneous layer, conditions are much more difficult. Nevertheless, a clear diaphanoscopy can now be seen when pressure is applied with the finger. Clear conditions under sonographic control. No liver or intestinal loops in the abdominal wall. Placement of the PEG with the thread pull-through method in the usual way. No bleeding. Primary wound dressing on the abdomen. Intraoperative administration of 250 mg SDH. Now infiltration anesthesia in the area of the right neck. First incision of a platysmal flap and careful dissection of the platysma further cranially. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is also exposed in depth. Further dissection of the platysmal flap over the submandibular gland in a cranial direction. Now dissection of the internal jugular vein and facial vein in depth. Very difficult dissection conditions. A large metastasis infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle. For this reason, part of the muscle must be sharply separated from the metastasis. Finally, the internal jugular vein can be freed from the metastasis. Deep dissection of the vagus nerve and the external and internal carotid arteries as well as the accessorius nerve. Expose the posterior digastric venter muscle. Now complete the posterior neck by clearing out the accessorius triangle and dissecting the mass caudally to supraclavicular. Separate the soft tissue there and cut around it. Finally, dissection of the venous angle. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Removal of the capsule of the submandibular gland. The previously described metastasis is now also completely separated from the facial vein. The vein remains intact. Dissection of the superior thyroid artery and completion of the neck preparation on the right with removal of all soft tissue and lymph nodes. Now proceed to the left. Here too, skin incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection of the muscle in depth after cutting through the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure of the internal jugular vein and the external and internal carotid arteries as well as the vagus nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and the posterior digastric venter muscle. Now dissect the posterior neck preparation from cranial to caudal. Protect the cervical plexus. Set down caudally after repositioning. Now dissect the submandibular gland. Remove the capsule. Dissection of the hypoglossal nerve and completion of the neck preparation anteriorly, including the capsule of the submandibular gland and the soft tissue in front of and above the common carotid artery. Perform the tracheotomy. Median skin incision for this. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and the infrahyoid musculature. Difficult dissection conditions due to the very deep larynx. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining, cutting through and perforating it. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a Björk flap and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Relatively high tension due to the deep trachea. Re-intubation of the patient. Now turn back to the tumor side on the right and skeletonize the larynx on the right side or the thyroid cartilage. Enter the pharynx. The tumor becomes visible. This is also clinically incised in healthy tissue. It reaches up to the arytenoid cusp. Extremely difficult dissection conditions here. It is finally possible to resect the entire tumor from cranial to caudal, including part of the larynx and half of the thyroid cartilage on the right. Removal of marginal samples. These are found to be tumor-free. Extensive hemostasis with H2O2 and bipolar coagulation. Now perform the pharyngeal suture. The previously prepared platysmal flap is not required. Primary wound closure can be performed. Invert the sutures from caudal to cranial. Multi-layer wound closure. Mobilize the right thyroid gland and suture the thyroid gland over the pharyngeal suture again. Extensive hemostasis in the area of the right neck. Irrigation with H2O2. Irrigation with H2O2 and NaCl on the left side as well. No more bleeding. Insertion of a Redon drain on the left and right side. Subcutaneous sutures, skin sutures and wound dressing. The platysmal flap is resected and primary skin closure can be achieved on the right side by adapting the wound edges. Finally, an 8-gauge Rügheimer cannula is inserted again. The patient goes to the intensive care unit extubated or awake for monitoring. Further administration of Unacid over the next few days. No bleeding at the end of the operation, no other special features. The tumor and the neck specimen on both sides are sent for definitive histology.

No significant reduction of the tumor during the course, therefore pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again before surgery.","Start of the operation by tracheotomy. For this purpose, approx. 3 cm horizontal skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin of the subcutis. Identification of the infralaryngeal muscles and separation in the midline. Separation of the muscle bellies and identification of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus with the clamp and bipolar coagulation of the isthmus as well as isthmus splitting. Now identification of the anterior tracheal wall and entry into the 3rd intertracheal ring space by means of a visor tracheotomy. Insertion of an 8 mm tube. Now draw in the apron flap. This runs on both sides along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the mastoid (2 QF) below the mandible. Now cut the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue on both sides. Separation of the platysma. Subplatysmal dissection of the apron flap in the usual manner and slinging using 3 sutures. Now pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: positioning of the patient. Insertion of the Kleinsasser tube. The tumor can be seen on the left, which passes from the arytenoid cartilage via the aryepiglottic fold to the piriform sinus and onto the hypopharyngeal side wall up to the cranial vallecula. Base of tongue not infiltrated macroscopically. Overall indication for laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy, if necessary with flap coverage. Sterile draping and injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck follows. Then lift an apron flap in the typical manner up to the submandibular gland on both sides and subplatysmal at the level of the hyoid bone. Then neck dissection on the left: Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein and external and internal carotid arteries. Exposure of the accessory nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve. Clearing level II to V. Here also visualization and preservation of the branches of the cervical plexus. Macroscopically no clear evidence of lymph node involvement. Subsequent right neck dissection Level II to V: Identification and visualization of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissection down to depth. Identification of the omohyoid muscle. Dissection along the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid bone. Now cranial identification of the digastric muscle and detachment of the submandibular gland from the glandular capsule. Now identify the accessorius nerve. The nerve is safely spared and dissected free from the neck preparation. Also identification of the hypoglossal nerve. Sharp dissection along the V. jugularis interna and lateral tapping of the neck preparation. Now free the cervical vascular nerve sheath from the neck preparation. The carotid artery, vagus nerve and jugular vein must be safely identified and protected. Now remove the neck preparation in the usual manner from cranial to caudal while sparing the deep plexus branches. Completion of the neck dissection on the right side without complications. Subsequent laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy: first exposing the hyoid bone and separating it from the suprahyoid musculature. Pre-epiglottic fatty tissue is included in the resection. Exposure of the left superior cornu and exposure of the laryngeal skeleton. Hypopharynx remains on the laryngeal skeleton. Caudal dissection of the thyroid gland. Subsequent isolation of the right superior cornu, dissection of the hypopharynx from the laryngeal skeleton. Caudal dissection of the thyroid gland. Subsequent entry into the larynx, initially from the right paramedian side. Exposure of the tumor. Cut around the tumor macroscopically with a safety margin of at least 1 to 1.5 cm. The larynx is integrated into the resection. Caudal dissection of the larynx from the distal hypopharynx or esophageal entrance. Deposition of the larynx above the tracheostoma. Prior to this, preparation of a mucosal flap from the cricoid cartilage, which is dissected off here and sutured to the tracheal cartilage remaining cranial to the tracheostoma. This creates a Hermann ridge. Sutures with 3 or 4-0 Vicryl. The larynx is marked with sutures. In the area from the middle of the base of the tongue to the left pharyngeal wall, a further marginal sample is obtained and also marked with sutures; this is sent to the frozen section. The frozen section still shows carcinoma in situ infiltrates in the area of the middle of the tongue base and moderate dysplasia in the area of the left pharyngeal wall. Therefore, another 1 cm resection was taken from the base of the tongue, which extended to the left pharyngeal wall. No more infiltrates in the tumor-free part in the frozen section. However, there is still moderate dysplasia at several edges, no further surgical measures in the case of suspected field carcinomatization. Myotomy on the left in the typical manner and insertion of a size 8 provox prosthesis in the typical manner. Subsequent suturing of the hypopharynx, partly continuous, partly inverting single button sutures. Subsequently 2nd suture inverted over the 1st suture. Further inverting sutures are made, particularly in the area of the base of the tongue. Then 3rd suture of the musculature over the 2nd suture, also with Vicryl 4-0 single button sutures. A gastric tube was inserted as a splint before pharyngeal closure. Subsequently, careful irrigation of the wound area with hemostasis and layered wound closure with insertion of a Redon drainage in both sides of the neck. The tracheostoma was also epithelialized. Subsequent completion of the procedure without complications. Patient received preoperative antibiotics with Unacid. Please continue this antibiotic treatment for one week. Feeding via PEG tube for approx. 12 days, then carefully build up diet after swallowing porridge. Presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference after receipt of the final histology. Due to the moderate dysplasia and suspected field carcinomatization, discuss radiotherapy postoperatively.","Laryngectomy, Neck dissection, Tracheostomy creation

There is a history of alcohol and nicotine abuse. A sample was taken in the panendoscopy <2016>. This revealed a P16 negative G3 squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.,"Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesiology colleagues, then the PEG is inserted first. For this purpose, the flexible oesophagogastroscope is used to enter the stomach. The mucosa is unremarkable. If the diaphanoscopy is good, the PEG is inserted using the thread pull-through method without complications. Repositioning and insertion of the spandex and a covered wound blocker. Inspection of the tumor region. The tumor is located in the area of the glossotonsillar groove on the left, merges into the base of the tongue, merges onto the alveolar ridge of the lower jaw and merges into the lateral floor of the mouth. Now snare the tongue and start resecting the tumor in the tongue area with the monopolar needle. The tumor is cut around the edge of the tongue up to the base of the tongue. The tumor is then cut around in the area of the floor of the mouth and the side wall of the pharynx. Then push the tumor away from the lower jaw in the area of the alveolar ridge. This was successful without any problems. Extension of the resection in the area of the glossotonsillar groove. Although the mouth opening is very small, it is possible to resect the tumor completely transorally with maximum relaxation and opening of the mouth. The tumor is retrieved en bloc. Subsequent resections are performed in the area where the tumor is macroscopically close to the resection margins. At the end, marginal samples are taken and the tumor specimen is sent in thread-marked. All marginal samples are free of tumor, carcinoma and dysplasia in the frozen section. Now measure the defect and proceed to neck dissection. At the same time, the radialis graft is lifted by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Lifting of the radialis flap using <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Marking of the graft in the presence of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Skin incision along the previously defined flap boundaries and S-shaped skin incision into the antecubital fossa. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue, initially in the area of the flap pedicle down to the forearm fascia. Identification of the superficial cutaneous veins. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein. It can be seen that the vein can be included in the skin graft on the radial side. After inspecting the superficial venous situation, the forearm fascia is incised along the flexor carpi radialis muscle and the brachioradialis muscle in a distal direction. The forearm fascia is then incised in the area of the flap edges. In this case, the ulnar fascia is first dissected subfascially, leaving the peritendineum and perimysium of the adjacent muscles and tendons of the forearm intact. Identification of the ulnar artery. This can be left uninjured without any problems. Distal skin incision through the forearm fascia and subfascial dissection up to the anterior edge of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Radial incision with inclusion of the cephalic vein in the graft. Here too, subfascial dissection is performed up to the anterior edge of the brachioradialis muscle. Particular care is taken here to preserve the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Identification of the distal radial artery. Undermining of the radial artery with the clamp and clamping of the artery. After clamping the radial artery, there is no decrease in oxygen saturation (measured on the index finger). After approx. 5 minutes, the distal radial artery is severed and the stumps are supplied with a bypass ligature. The radial artery flap is now lifted from the depth alternately from the radial and ulnar side along the septum under constant bleeding control using the bipolar coagulation forceps and clip supply. After insertion of a proximal retractor between the muscle bellies of the .............................. carpi radialis and brachioradialis muscles, the flap pedicle is also dissected. The radial nerve can be spared here. The radial nerve can be spared. Dissection is carried out up to the confluence of the veins and up to the exit of the interosseous artery. The artery is also clamped with a clip for a few minutes. Here, too, there is no decrease in oxygen saturation (measured on the index finger). Once the interosseous artery has been ligated and ligated, the flap can be lifted without any problems. The wound is closed in two layers in the area of the S-shaped skin incision on the flap pedicle and split skin is sutured in the area of the former skin flap. The split skin is sutured in place with Ethilon 5.0 in single button sutures. Exposed tendons are covered with muscle tissue beforehand. Preparation swabs are attached to the split skin with deep skin sutures to fix the split skin graft to the substrate. This is followed by the application of a wound dressing with absorbent cotton and the application of a dorsal splint in a slightly extended position of the wrist as well as the application of a flexible bandage. Completion of flap elevation without complications. Start with neck dissection on the left side. Skin incision in a transverse skin fold. Exposure of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. Overall difficult preparation conditions as the neck is very voluminous and short. Exposure of the nervus accessorius and the cervical vascular sheath. The hypoglossal nerve and the lingual artery were already removed during the tumor resection. Now remove the neck specimen II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. This causes the internal jugular vein to tear due to traction. This is carefully sutured over so that further flow is possible. As an anatomical variation, the facial vein emerges directly from the external jugular vein and the internal jugular vein has no further outlets in the area of the aforementioned level. Now remove the submandibular gland and clear level I b. Cut through the digastric muscle and create an enoral tunnel so that 3 transverse fingers can fit through. Now turn to the neck dissection on the opposite side. Here also skin incision in a transverse skin fold. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. Then evacuation of neck levels II a to V a, sparing the plexus branches and hypoglossal nerve and the accessorius and cervical nerves. Here, too, the internal jugular vein is torn by hook traction. The entire venous tissue is extremely fragile. Unfortunately, it is not possible to close the tear of the internal jugular vein on the right side by suturing it over. Recall from <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Ultimately, the internal jugular vein must be completely closed above an outlet and ligated. Then insertion of Tabotamp and completion of the neck dissection. Dissection of the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein and external jugular vein for flap connection. Removal of the radialis graft. It can be seen that although there is a good radial artery on the radialis graft itself, the venous situation is extremely critical. There are 2 tiny concomitant veins and a slender venous confluence between the superficial and deep system. In the end, the decision is made to use the radialis graft anyway. It is now sutured in place by placing sutures in the deep area of the oropharynx in the area of the base of the tongue and the side wall of the pharynx. The graft is then successively retracted and finally sutured in the area of the soft palate, the cheek and the anterior part of the edge of the tongue. The stalk is transferred to the right side and anastomosed with the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein and a further outlet from the facial vein. In the meantime, the tracheotomy was performed using the visor technique. At the end, a Redon drain was inserted on the left side and a flap on the right side. The patient went to the intensive care unit on a ventilator and was to continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours.

Then induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. Then tracheoscopy by the surgeon. In the area of the endolarynx, vocal fold level, subglottic to the trachea and carina, mucosal conditions are unremarkable on all sides. Subsequent intubation of the patient by the anesthesia colleagues. Head reclination by the surgeon and insertion of the flexible esophagogastroscope. Careful endoscopy into the stomach. Mucosal conditions in the stomach and esophagus are normal on all sides. Then insertion with the size C small bore tube. Careful endoscopy into the oropharynx. In the area of the soft and hard palate as well as the tonsil region, the mucosa is normal on all sides. The mucosa is also normal at the base of the tongue, epiglottis and vallecula. The piriform sinus is freely unfoldable and inconspicuous on both sides, as are the postcricoid region and the endolarynx. Subsequent insertion of a Jennings blocker. Tongue suture and disluxation of the tongue for closer inspection of the tongue edge and the underside of the tongue. A large, histologically confirmed carcinoma measuring approx. 1 x 1 cm was found in the area of the underside of the tongue on the right. Demonstration of the findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and successive excision with half a centimeter safety distance to the macroscopically visible tumor border using a monopolar needle. In the area of the epithelium in depth, carefully dissect further with plastic forceps and scissors and cut out the tumor while maintaining the safety distance. The tumor is thread-marked for frozen section examination. Careful hemostasis using bipolar forceps in the area of the tongue muscles; no macroscopic evidence of further tumor invasion in the wound area. Following notification of an R0 situation by the pathology colleagues and after consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the decision was made to perform a further resection in the area of the cranial wound base towards the tip of the tongue, as there is a close R0 situation here at 12 o'clock. An arcuate, final margin trial is also performed in the area from 9 to 3 o'clock. The post-resection and marginal sample are both thread-marked for final histology; please note this. Conclusion: Overall unremarkable panendoscopy and resection of the histologically confirmed carcinoma on the underside of the tongue without complications. According to the frozen section, there is an R0 resection on all sides; however, please note the resection and the final margin sample and present the patient to the tumor conference, if necessary, order an ultrasound for regional neck status documentation.","Panendoscopy, Tumor excision

Sterile washing and draping. Insertion of a McIvor oral spatula and inspection of the tumor region. The tumor moves from the tonsil lobe to the soft palate, from there to the base of the uvula, to the anterior and posterior palatal arch, then to the posterior pharyngeal wall caudally to the right-sided vallecula and the lateral pharyngeal wall. Start with transoral tumor resection in the area of the soft palate. Successive resection of the tumor with a safety margin of 1 cm. Dissection down to the base of the tongue. The tumor also infiltrates the base of the tongue. Then change to the transcervical region. Skin incision in the area of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid. Exposure of the lower part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein in the lower part. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Then transection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, because the N3 neck metastasis infiltrates the upper part of the muscle and also the vein. Then removal of the internal jugular vein. Dissection of the tumor from the internal carotid artery. The external carotid artery must also be removed due to tumor infiltration. In addition, superficial plexus branches and the accessorius nerve must also be removed, as well as the hypoglossal nerve and the submandibular gland. Level I also contains large, conspicuous nodes. Level I is therefore also removed. The tendon of the omohyoid muscle, which is also infiltrated, is severed. The caudal part of the parotid gland is also infiltrated and the oral branch must also be resected. The tumor is in direct contact with the N3 neck metastasis, but is not completely connected to it, so it is possible to remove the metastasis separately from the tumor and also the remaining neck tissue. The tumor is then pulled outwards from the transcervical area and resected. The result is a fairly large, three-dimensional defect from the vallecula up to the soft palate. The defect is then measured and the graft designed. The graft is designed so that it is 17 cm long and has an angled section for tongue reconstruction, which is also approx. 8 to 9 cm in size. This graft is then lifted by <CLINICIAN_NAME> on the arm. Mark the graft for this purpose. Skin incision. Visualization of the vascular situation in the crook of the elbow and the vascular pedicle. Exposure of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve, which is divided into 2 branches. One branch is severed by <CLINICIAN_NAME> due to the size of the graft. However, the main branch remains intact. Now change the operators from <CLINICIAN_NAME> to <CLINICIAN_NAME> and complete the graft elevation. To do this, lift the graft from the tendon bed. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle and preparation of the pedicle in the usual manner. Then further dissection of the vascular situation in the crook of the elbow and removal of the graft while preserving 3 venous vessels. Marking of the radial artery. Now conditioning of the vessels in the neck area. The stump of the internal jugular vein is already thrombosed, as is the stump of the external jugular vein. This is no longer an option for the transplant. An accompanying vein in the area of the omohyoid is prepared. The stump of the external artery is also already occluded and is no longer suitable as a connecting vessel. The superior thyroid artery is therefore prepared and conditioned. Now fitting the graft into the defect and suturing the graft, mostly transcervically. This is extremely difficult because the graft is very large and very bulky and also because of the considerable swelling in the palate, uvula and tongue. In the end, the graft was able to fit completely. Now the vessels are anastomosed, first the arterial and then the venous vessels. Only one venous vessel can be connected, as the other two do not show any blood return; they are clipped. A flap is then inserted and the wound is closed in two layers. Parallel to the graft elevation, the neck is dissected on the left side, initially through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Representation of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Clearing of the medial neck block with preservation of the facial vein and artery. Exposure of level IIa with preservation of the accessorius nerve. Then transfer of <CLINICIAN_NAME> and removal of neck levels II b to V a while preserving the plexus branches. Insertion of a Redon drainage, two-layer wound closure. Then perform the tracheotomy through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Make a skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection down to the musculature. Splitting of the musculature in the linea alba. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Entering the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis and reintubation on an 8 mm tube. A flap is inserted in the area of the right side of the neck and a two-layer wound closure is performed. The patient goes to IOI intubated and ventilated due to heart and lung problems. Please perform an X-ray gruel swallow on the 10th postoperative day. Continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours.","Tumor resection, Left neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

The above-mentioned intervention is therefore indicated for treatment.,"First, pharyngoscopy and MLE again: The exophytic tumor is visible, which starts at the palatal arch next to the uvula on the left, extends over the tonsillar lobe to the base of the tongue. In the area of the pharyngeal side wall up to the edge of the posterior wall. The tumor shows exulcerative character and deep growth. Therefore primary indication for combined resection. Sterile draping and injection of a total of 20 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline in the area of both sides of the neck. Start with transoral resection: Cut around the tumor with a safety margin of 1 ˝ to 2 cm on all sides, initially from the enoral side. Smaller parts of the palatal arch on the right, the uvula, the entire palatal arch on the left, mucosa along the alveolar ridge up to the glossoalveolar groove and the beginning of the tongue base, pharyngeal posterior wall falls to the middle, caudally the resection extends from the transoral side to the entrance of the piriform sinus. Then repositioning for neck dissection on the right with subsequent completion of the resection from transcervical: submandibular incision. Cut along the sternocleidomastoid muscle caudally. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Showing digastric muscle, submandibular gland. Showing the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein, external and internal carotid artery. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Successive evacuation level I b to V. Co-resection of the submandibular gland. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. The facial artery is ligated cranially in preparation for tumor resection. The transoral resection is then completed by transcervical resection: the entire pharyngeal wall is included up to the cervical vascular sheath. A portion of the base of the tongue is resected caudally as well as the mucosa up to the piriform sinus entrance and all soft tissue up to the cornu superius or hyoid bone. In total, marginal samples are taken from the palatal arch, laterally to the alveolar ridge, from the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall. In addition, a cranial basal margin sample and a caudal basal margin sample are taken. All marginal samples are sent to frozen section diagnostics with the tumor specimen, which is marked with a thread. In the frozen section, all margin samples are tumor-free, as is the specimen. Thus R0 situation intraoperatively. Subsequent left neck dissection and tracheotomy (<CLINICIAN_NAME>). Neck dissection left: Skin incision. Then exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Visualization of the cervical vascular sheath. Level II shows several lymph node metastases, which are removed while sparing the vessels of the jugular vein, the external and internal carotid arteries and while sparing and exposing the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Then further successive evacuation of levels I, III and V. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery and facial artery. Then repositioning for tracheotomy. Skin incision in the usual manner. Dissection of the musculature. Push the muscles to the side and expose the thyroid gland. Undermining of the thyroid gland and clamping on both sides. Then transection of the isthmus and ligation on both sides. Exposure of the trachea. Opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage gap. Omission of a Björk flap and epithelialization of the skin. Insertion of a laryngectomy tube, which was later intubated with a tracheal cannula. The radial flap is then removed: first the size and dimensions of the flap are measured at the situs. Maximum length 14 cm, maximum width 9 cm. The size and dimensions of the flap are marked on the forearm. Flap elevation is performed without tourniquet. Saturation at the beginning 100%. Cut around the flap first from the ulnar, then from the radial side. Extension of the incision curved in the direction of the crook of the elbow. Subfascial elevation of the flap successively. Exposure of the flap pedicle below the brachioradialis. Previously, the superficial venous outflow was also exposed above it. The radial artery was visualized and clamped for 20 minutes. There was no deterioration in saturation, which was always 100%. Subsequently, the radial artery was removed and treated with 4-0 Prolene stitches caudally and cranially. Flap is successively lifted subfascially, smaller vessels are coagulated bipolarly or supplied with clips. Lifting of the flap pedicle up to the elbow. Exposure of the radial artery, brachial artery, ulnar artery and interosseous artery. Also show the radial vein and the superficial venous outflow, which ends in 2 branches in the area of the cephalic vein. There is a stable connection to the deep venous system. Subsequent removal of the flap, ligation of the veins, removal of the radial artery before the interosseous outlet. Here clip and stitch sutures with 4-0 Prolene. Flap is irrigated with heparin. Subsequent insertion of the flap into the defect: The flap is inserted into the defect according to the size and shape lifted. The flap pedicle is inserted caudally below the preserved hypoglossal nerve on the left and passed through a previously created tunnel to the right side. Successive suturing of the flap, partly with sutures in the defect. Tension-free, anatomically correct suturing is achieved. Subsequent anastomosis of the vessels on the right side: conditioning of the radial artery and the superior thyroid artery. These are sutured using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and very good venous return. Subsequent conditioning of the radial vein and cephalic vein. Also conditioning of a small outlet from the facial vein and the external jugular vein. The smaller radial vein is anastomosed to the outlet from the facial vein using a 1.5 mm coupler. The cephalic vein is also anastomosed with the external jugular vein using a second coupler size 3.5 mm. Good venous return in each case. Positive smear phenomenon. Flap very well perfused intraoperatively. Subsequent irrigation of the wound area, careful hemostasis. Layered wound closure with insertion of a Redon drain in each case. The position of the anastomosis in the area of the external jugular vein is marked. Then insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula, which is fixed with sutures. Defect coverage of the forearm using inguinal skin from the right: An appropriately sized piece of full-thickness skin is removed from the groin area in the typical manner. The inguinal skin is mobilized accordingly and then closed in several layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. Skin sutures using the Donati technique. Full-thickness skin is then thinned out and successively sutured into the defect on the caudal forearm. This is done without tension. The upper sections of the wound on the forearm are closed in layers in the typical manner. A hydrogel-Mepilex dressing is then applied, followed by a loose compress dressing and wrapping in absorbent cotton. Fitting of a Kramer splint and wrapping in an elastic bandage. The procedure is completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics, which were started preoperatively, for a total of 1 week. Heparin perfusor 500 units per hour for 5 days. Flap control in typical clinical manner and by means of Doppler control for 5 days. Total cT3 cN2c oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left. R0 resection intraoperatively. Postoperatively, due to the overall situation, RCT to be discussed. Feeding via a PEG tube for 10 days, then control of swallowing of gruel and diet build-up.","Transcervical resection, Pharyngoscopy, MLE (Microlaryngoscopy and Endoscopy), Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial)

The primary tumor cannot be delineated on computed tomography; there are unspecific, most likely reactive, enlarged lymph nodes on both sides, no evidence of lung metastases. There is therefore now an indication for the above-mentioned operation.","First induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. Then tracheoscopy and intubation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. This reveals an inconspicuous mucosa up to the caudal carina. Subsequent inspection and palpation of the tongue, base of tongue, tonsil lobe and soft palate. A slight induration is palpated on the front of the soft palate on the left side, just above the upper alveolar ridge, measuring just under 1 cm2 on inspection. The tongue, base of the tongue and floor of the mouth are inconspicuous on palpation. Now insert the size C Kleinsasser tube. Mirror forward into the piriform sinus, which can be freely unfolded on both sides. The postcricoid region, interaryngeal region and endolarynx are inconspicuous. The esophagogastroscopy was then performed. This is completely unremarkable. Now proceed to tumor excision. Insert the Mc Ivor oral spatula for this. Marking of the subsequent resectate borders using a monopolar and subsequent monopolar incision around the tumor. Subsequent cold dissection in depth and removal of the tumor, which appears to be growing on the surface. Marking at 12 o'clock short short and at 9 o'clock median short long and sending for frozen section. Subtle hemostasis and positioning of the patient for neck dissection. Injection of 10 ml xylocaine with adrenaline in the area of the subsequent skin incision. Then abjode and sterile draping of the surgical field. Now start with the skin incision on the mastoid, curving forward to caudal to supraclavicular. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure of the auricularis magnus nerve and the external jugular vein. Ligation of the external jugular vein and protection of the auricular nerve. Subsequent exposure of the platysma and separate dissection. Exposure of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle from caudal to cranial. Subsequently, cranial preparation on the capsule of the submandibular gland and removal or tapping caudally of the capsule in the anterior neck preparation. Dissection on the digaster venter posteriorly and dissection anteriorly. Then caudal dissection of the omohyoid muscle with dissection anteriorly and union with the anterior neck preparation cranially. Subsequent dissection of the lateral neck preparation. Free preparation of the vein with removal of the outer leaf and tapping into the neck preparation. Develop the neck preparation from caudal to cranial. In doing so, protect the cervical plexus. The common carotid artery is dissected in depth and the vagus nerve is exposed. Further dissection in a cranial direction. Exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve. Dissection of level IIb. Detachment of the lateral neck preparation in toto. Subsequent detachment of the previously dissected anterior neck preparation. Subtle hemostasis, followed by insertion of a Redon drain, subcutaneous and platysma suture with 5-0 Ethilon. Subsequent transition to enoral resection after the frozen section revealed that the squamous cell carcinoma was resected at 9 o'clock with less than 1 mm in sano, but the carcinoma in situ was margin-forming at the same site. Therefore, resection from 12 o'clock median to after 6 o'clock on a width of approx. 0.5 cm and removal of a margin sample. Both are sent for final histology. Subtle hemostasis and termination of the operation at this point without complications. Conclusion: Squamous cell carcinoma cT1 oral cavity soft palate anterior left side removed in sano in a frozen section. However, here carcinoma in situ forming a margin, a resection and a margin sample were removed, these were sent for final histology. Neck dissection level II-V left side performed without complications.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy

The left vocal fold shows a whitish, exophytic mass over the entire length of the vocal fold. Reinke's edema can also be seen. The mass is carefully cut around with the CO2 laser. A swab on the tube protects the cuff, which remains intact. A sufficient safety margin was left anteriorly at the anterior commissure. If the patient is difficult to adjust, it is necessary to switch between the small bore tube C and D and to readjust the tumor several times. However, complete resection of the tumor is possible without any problems. Dorsally, the resection margin extends to the vocalis process, basally to the vocalis muscle. The vocalis muscle can be identified as tumor-free muscle tissue. There is no increased bleeding after resection. Now take 3 marginal samples. These are taken dorsally at the vocal process, basally at the vocalis muscle and caudally at the sedimentation margin or subglottic slope. Insertion of a suprarenal swab. All these marginal samples are tumor-free. Removal of the swab. If there is no bleeding, the operation is ended. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist.

Preoperative extent determined. Tumor extends from the anterior palatal arch over the pharyngeal wall into the base of the tongue on the right. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned operation.,"First transoral tumor resection: Firstly, bridle suture of the tongue. Followed by Mc Ivor spatula or retractor insertion. Tumor is resected on all sides with a safety margin of 1 to 1.5 cm. Later, the anterior palatal arch, the tonsil and parts of the pharyngeal wall and the base of the tongue up to the middle of the tongue are also resected. During resection, the deep external tongue muscles are also resected; the lingual nerve cannot be preserved and must be resected as well. The resection extends deep down to the submandibular gland. The entire preparation is marked with sutures. In addition, frozen sections are taken basally. Parts of the pharyngeal wall and the submandibular gland as well as external tongue muscles are sent in as basal margin samples for the frozen section. In the frozen section, basal margin samples are tumor-free, but the tumor extends at least as far as the cranial edge of the specimen. Therefore, the cranial mucosa including soft tissue is resected again. In addition, a cranial margin sample is taken from the soft tissue area. Now tumor-free in the frozen section. Thus R0 situation. Subsequent careful hemostasis in the entire wound area. Fatty tissue is already partially exposed next to the pharyngeal muscles. The submandibular gland and the facial artery are exposed caudally. The facial artery is ligated once. Muscle tissue is then sutured over the gland and the facial artery using Vicryl 3/0 sutures. Finally, irrigation and further careful hemostasis. No more bleeding on final inspection. No neck dissection on the right due to the extent of the resection on the right. The decision is made to perform the left neck dissection first. PEG placement and tracheostomy are also indicated. First modified radical neck dissection on the left (<CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME> in alternation) Skin incision in a typical manner in front of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then dissection of the lymph node fat packet from the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the digastric and omohyoid muscles. Exposure of the accessor nerve, internal jugular vein, internal and external carotid artery, vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Development of the dorsal neck preparation and preservation of the branches of the cervical plexus. Some conspicuous lymph nodes. Then develop the anterior neck preparation, exposing and preserving the hypoglossal nerve and superior thyroid artery. Then irrigation of the wound area with H2O2 and Ringer's solution and careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers and insertion of a Redon drain. Subsequent PEG insertion: advancement of the esophagoscope into the stomach. Insertion of a 9-bore abdominal wall tube in a typical manner without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in a typical manner. Then tracheostoma creation: Small Kocher collar incision. Dissection through subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature. This is split medially. Subsequently expose the thyroid isthmus, pass under it, clamp it, cut it open and treat it with stitches. Now expose the trachea. Entering the 2nd intercartilaginous space. Creation of a small Björk flap. Epithelialization of the same. Re-intubation and insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. Finally, enoral inspection again. No bleeding. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Overall extensive resection transorally for cT2 to cT3 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Due to the depth, neck dissection is certainly not indicated for another 2 to 3 weeks. If there is an R1 situation somewhere towards the basal area, a resection with flap coverage would be indicated. If neck dissection remains the case, removal of the submandibular gland should not be performed in any case, as otherwise there is a risk of a continuous defect.","Transoral resection on the right, Modified radical left neck dissection, PEG, Tracheotomy

The glossotonsillar groove on the right side extends almost into the left glossotonsillar groove. The tumor extends caudally into the vallecula. The right lingual artery is ligated. On the left side, a pulsating vessel is still palpable in the depth, even after resection, 'so that the left side of the tongue should still be supplied. Due to the size of the tumor and a palpable cone extending both laterally and caudally, now combined transoral, transcervical resection. Skin incision and dissection through the fatty tissue, dissection through the platysma. Now subplatysmal dissection and finding the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Expose the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and find the omohyoid muscle. Cranial dissection. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and the posterior vein of the digastric muscle. It can be seen that the tumor extends into the submandibular lobe and has a medial extension to the pharyngeal tube. Pull through technique of the tumor. Submandibulectomy on the right. Further successive dissection of the tumor at a distance of approx. 1 cm from the surrounding tissue. The tumor can be completely removed. After suture marking, the tumor is sent for frozen section.

Here both the facial and external jugular veins are ligated and the common and external carotid arteries are exposed. Identification of the hypoglossal nerve and preservation of this. Successive removal of the lateral and medial neck preparation with preservation of the ansa and brachial plexus. The vagus nerve can also be identified and spared. There is no evidence of a chyle fistula. Now expose the ramus marginalis, the facial nerve and dissect anteriorly. Expose the submandibular gland and remove it. Ligation of the facial artery and the duct. Protection of the lingual nerve on the left side after submandibulectomy. Now successive removal of Level Ia and b so that Level Ia and b, Level IIa and b, III, IV and V have been removed in total. If there is no indication of increased bleeding, irrigation of the neck and insertion of a Redondra ring. Two-layer wound closure. Elevation of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (14 x 6 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris.

Re-inspection of the tumor region. The tumor extends in the posterior third of the edge of the tongue, extends to the base of the tongue, the glossotonsillar groove and the alveolar ridge, but is displaceable in relation to these. Now insertion of the retractors. Place a retaining thread and pull out the tongue. Establish the resection margins with a sufficient safety margin around the tumor. Now successive dissection of the tumor, taking the right palatine tonsil with it. Careful protection of the right posterior palatal arch, the lingual nerve, the lingual fibers of the hypoglossal nerve and the Wharton's duct. Excision of the tumor with sufficient safety margin in toto. The specimen is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. Careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. In the frozen section, the tumor is found to be R0 resected, but the specimen shows a carcinoma in situ that is probably not connected to the tumor and reaches the edge of the palatal arch. Before resecting the tumor, the patient was first examined with an esophagogastroscope. Pre-viewing to the stomach and placement of the PEG tube using the thread pull-through method in the typical manner, after positive diaphanoscopy. Now turn first to neck dissection on the right. After skin disinfection, infiltration anesthesia with Ultracaine with added adrenaline. Skin incision on the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath with jugular vein, carotid artery and vagus nerve. Sparing of the structures. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and protection of the same. Now successive dissection of the lateral neck preparation while carefully protecting the plexus branches. Subsequent dissection of the remaining soft tissue below the plexus from level V. Careful hemostasis with bipolar coagulation. Several large nodes are seen in level II, these are excised in toto, the accessorius nerve can be spared here. Resection of the medial neck preparation while sparing the hypoglossal nerve. Now turn to the left neck dissection. Here too, infiltration anesthesia with Ultracaine with the addition of adrenaline after skin disinfection. Skin incision on the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure and dissection of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and protection of the same. Dissection of the cervical vascular sheath with jugular vein, carotid artery and vagus nerve. Now successive dissection of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the plexus branches. Careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Now, post-dissection in the area of the medial neck preparation and removal of the remaining soft tissue while carefully protecting the structures mentioned. Now irrigation on both sides using hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a Redon drain. Subcutaneous suture, skin suture. Now insert the mouth retractor again and turn to the primary tumor region. Post-resection in the area of the right uvular margin and the palatal arch. The specimen is sent for final histology. Removal of a marginal sample, which is again sent for frozen section diagnostics. Once again careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. In the frozen section, moderate dysplasia is still seen in the marginal sample, no evidence of carcinoma or carcinoma in situ. The operation was therefore terminated after further careful hemostasis. Conclusion: Enormal resection and neck dissection on both sides of a cT2 tongue margin carcinoma on the right. In the frozen section, in addition to the carcinoma, a carcinoma in situ in the area of the palatal arch, therefore, due to the clinical suspicion of field cancerization, adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated.

After appropriate preparation, the gastric tube is first inserted through the left nasal cavity, the correct position of which is then checked by auscultation. Skin disinfection. Infiltration with local anesthetic containing adrenaline in the area of the subsequent skin incision. Sterile washing and draping. Marking of the apron flap incision with the tracheostoma in place. Dissection of the apron flap and cranial fixation in the usual manner. Then perform the neck dissection, initially on the left side. After skeletonization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the auricularis magnus nerve is exposed and spared until the end. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the auricularis magnus nerve in the sense of neurolysis. The same is done with the accessorius nerve. Displacement and re-embedding of the accessorius nerve at the end of the operation in the sense of a neurolysis. Skeletonization of the digastric muscle with exposure and protection of the hypoglossal nerve on the left side. Displacement and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve at the end of the operation. Opening of the cervical vascular nerve sheath and skeletonization of the internal jugular vein after identification of the vagus nerve. Regions II to V are then successively resected while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. Exposure of the lateral horn of the hyoid bone. Removal of the supralaryngeal vascular nerve bundle. Separation of the left larynx caudal to the hyoid bone. Exposure of the left lobe of the thyroid gland and lateral dissection. Separation of the straight neck muscles just above the clavicle. Undercutting of the isthmus, clamping, and removal and ligation on both sides. Separation of the constrictor pharyngis muscle from the thyroid cartilage and release of the piriform sinus on the left side. Transition to the opposite side. Similar procedure here. Here, too, there is no clinical evidence of a cervical lymph node metastasis. After complete mobilization of the larynx, the tracheostoma is first created. The 2nd tracheal clasp is incised in an H-shape and the caudal mucocutaneous anastomosis is created first. The lingual side of the epiglottis is then exposed through the pre-epiglottic fat body. Then open the pharynx and develop the larynx caudally along the epiglottis and the aryepiglottic folds. The tumor appears to be purely endolaryngeal. Both incisions are then connected caudally on the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage. Dissection caudally up to the 1st tracheal clasp. The entire laryngeal preparation is then removed together with the 1st tracheal clasp. Circular marginal incisions are taken from the pharyngeal defect as well as from the specimen itself at the right sublaryngeal margin. All marginal incisions proved to be free of tumor and dysplasia. Myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle. Insertion of a Provox voice prosthesis at the upper edge of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Then suture of the pharyngeal defect with a continuous inverting Conley suture. The second suture layer is performed using single button sutures. Insertion of a Redon suction drain on both sides. Completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis of the tracheostoma. Two-layer wound closure on both sides. Sterile wound dressing. Application of a pressure dressing. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Conclusion: Total laryngectomy with primary voice rehabilitation by insertion of a Provox voice prosthesis and myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle, selective neck dissection of regions II to V on both sides and insertion of a nasogastric tube.","Total laryngectomy with primary voice rehabilitation

The tumor was found to be the same size as in the previous panendoscopy. The patient is then repositioned and tumor resection begins from the soft palate. Here, the tumor does not reach the uvula so that it can be preserved. However, the anterior and posterior palatal arches must be partially removed. Careful coagulation, dissection and partial ligation of the vessels are then performed. Dissection from cranial to caudal. The main tumor mass then begins in the area of the lower tonsil pole and moves into the hypopharynx and from there onto the pharyngoepiglottic fold. The dissection is performed in the layers of the parapharyngeal musculature. Larger arterial vessels are cut several times during dissection if there is a clear tendency to bleed. Dissection is now carried out in the direction of the pharynx. In the area of the glossotonsillar groove, the tumor extends slightly onto the base of the tongue, so that a partial resection must also be carried out in the area of the base of the tongue and the tonsil at the base of the tongue. Careful hemostasis is also required here. It now appears that the tumor is draining at the level of the hypopharynx and piriform sinus entrance and can be deposited here at the pharyngoepiglottic plica. A separate margin sample is then taken in the area of the caudal margin. The corresponding area on the tumor specimen is also marked with a thread. This margin sample and the tumor specimen are then sent for frozen section assessment. However, this shows that the marginal specimen in the area of the deposit margin at the base of the tongue cannot be assessed due to thermal alterations. The sedimentation margin sample in the area of the caudal sedimentation margin shows broad tumor infiltrates, so that the decision is made to reposition the patient and use the spreading laryngoscope to adjust the area of the hypopharynx and the caudal sedimentation area. This is done easily after insertion of the mouthguard. Then pre-segmentation under vision up to the hypopharynx and adjustment of the caudal tumor bed. The surgical microscope and CO2 laser are now added so that this area can be resected again over a large area with the laser. Again, careful bipolar coagulation of larger vessel stumps. A marginal sample is then taken again. Both the resected specimen and the marginal specimen are then sent again for frozen section assessment. The findings here are that broad tumor infiltrates can again be found in the post-resectate. The marginal sample is again strongly thermally altered, but shows no tumor infiltrates. However, due to the poor findings, a second margin sample was taken, which was then designated as margin sample caudal no. 3 and was again sent for frozen section. This is then found to be tumor-free, so that an R0 resection of the tumor can now be assumed. Therefore, after repeated careful hemostasis, the PEG tube is inserted. To do this, the flexible esophagoscope is inserted into the esophagus and the tube is advanced under visualization into the stomach, where the PEG tube can then be placed without difficulty if the diaphanoscopy is positive and the tent phenomenon is positive. This is done using the typical thread pull-through method. The patient is then mirrored back and the esophagus is carefully inspected again, where the mucosa is found to be normal. The patient is then repositioned for the tracheostomy. Inject local anesthetic with adrenaline on both sides of the neck as well as prelaryngeally and tracheally. A door incision is then made pretracheally and dissected in layers in depth. Pre-tracheal vein branches are then partly ligated and partly bipolar coagulated. The pretracheal musculature is then exposed, separated in the midline and dissected apart. Further layered dissection in depth and exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is then undermined and, after separation of the isthmus, is ligated on both sides. Then expose the anterior surface of the trachea. Now enter the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp. Dissection of the Björk flap. Then circular suturing and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Then reintubation, which is also possible with an 8 mm tube. Now reposition the patient for neck dissection on the right side. First make a skin incision along the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then dissect in layers in depth after cutting through the platysma. Expose the cervical vascular sheath. In the cranial area, exposure and neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the auricularis magnus nerve. Then further dissection of the cervical vascular sheath in layers as far caudally as the omohyoid muscle and cranially to the digaster muscle. Here, lateral exposure of the accessorius nerve. Here too, neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the nerve. Then complete release of the lateral neck preparation from the accessorius triangle caudally, in the sense of levels II and III as well as IV and V. There is a lymph node conglomerate in the area of the vein angle, but this can be easily dissected away from the vein so that it can be well preserved. During dissection of the cervical vascular sheath, neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the vagus nerve. Subsequently, in the area of the hypoglossal triangle during preparation of the level Ib neck specimen. Then protection of all branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery. Here also neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve. The cervical profunda is also completely preserved during dissection and is also relocated and re-embedded in its course after neurolysis. Now dissection of the caudal medial neck preparation, where no conspicuous lymph nodes are found. All branches of the cervical plexus were also preserved during dissection of the lateral neck specimen. After significant arterial bleeding occurred intraoperatively in the area of the tumor resection, the decision was made to cut off the external carotid artery above the exit of the superior thyroid artery, which was then carried out without any problems after the external carotid artery had been clearly identified. The wound is then carefully irrigated. In summary, this results in a level Ib-V neck dissection. A Redon drain is then inserted. Two-layer wound closure and dressing. The patient is then repositioned for neck dissection on the left side. Here too, skin incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the left side. Subsequent dissection in layers in depth. In the cranial area, neurolysis, exposure and protection of the auricularis magnus nerve, after displacement of the nerve cranially. Further layered preparation in depth after cutting through the platysma. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the caudal and cranial borders. Exposure, neurolysis and displacement as well as re-embedding of the accessorius nerve. Then, here too, release of the lateral neck preparation from the accessorius triangle caudally. Dissection of the venous angle and hypoglossal triangle. In doing so, protect all branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery. Also exposure, neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve with the cervical profunda. Then complete dissection of the anterior neck preparation. Here too, the branches and branches of the external carotid artery and internal jugular vein are preserved. During dissection, the vagus nerve is also exposed, neurolyzed, displaced and re-embedded. Here, too, careful hemostasis was performed. Overall, this also results in a level Ib-V neck dissection. A Redon drain is then inserted and the wound is closed in two layers. Once the dressing has been applied, the procedure is completed after another enoral bleeding check with dry wound conditions. The patient is ventilated via the tracheostoma and transferred to the in-house intensive care unit. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist.","Transoral tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection

Sonographically, there is a yN2c neck status.","Introductory consultation with the anesthetist. Positioning of the patient and injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline in the area of the scar of the apron flap. Then skin incision along the old neck scar and preparation of an apron flap. Then exposure of the front edges of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides. Start with the neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Long dissection of the cervical vascular sheath with the internal jugular vein and the carotid artery and its branches as well as the vagus nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Exposure of the cervical plexus. A small lymph node conglomerate lateral to the vein can be seen caudal to the cervical plexus. This is excised. Careful hemostasis is performed. Dissection on the deep cervical fascia cranially up to the accessorius triangle. The hypoglossal triangle and the anterior neck preparation are also excised. Overall, there is massive scarring here, which is why the preparation conditions are significantly more difficult. Transition to the left side. Slightly less scarring here and therefore easier preparation. However, after exposing the cervical vascular sheath, the lateral neck preparation is still relatively complete. Therefore, exposure of the accessorius nerve, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the accessorius nerve and removal of the lateral neck preparation. Subsequently, the hypoglossal triangle and the anterior neck preparation were exposed and evacuated while sparing all branches of the external carotid artery and the internal jugular vein. On the right side, the facial vein was ligated. This results in neck revisions of levels Ib, II, III, IV and V on both sides. This is released cranially. This is followed by caudal release of the infrahyoid muscles. Separation of the prelaryngeal musculature in the median line so that the infrahyoid musculature and infralaryngeal musculature can be dissected away to the side. This exposes the laryngeal framework. The tumor does not appear to have penetrated the larynx on the right side, the cartilaginous border is intact here. Dissection up to the exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Dissection of the anterior wall of the trachea. Separation of the scarred parts of the thyroid gland. Hardened or suspicious nodules are not palpable in the thyroid gland if multinodular goiter is known. Visualization of the old scar of the former tracheotomy. Enter the trachea and prepare a visor tracheotomy. Subsequent intubation via an endotracheal tube via the tracheostoma and removal of the nasal tube placed by the anesthesia colleagues. Insertion of a McIvor blade into the vallecula and opening of the pharynx. Widen the pharyngeal opening so that the restepiglottis is visible. The supraglottic tumor described on the right side can now be seen in the view. Partial resection of the restepiglottis and caudal dissection. The dissection is performed above the level of the ligament. Lateral incision on the right side. Here it can be seen that the tumor has grown subepithelially paraglottically to far caudally, well below the vocal cord level. There is extensive tumor infestation here, which no longer allows partial laryngeal resection, so a switch is made to total laryngectomy. This completely exposes the lateral edges of the thyroid cartilage and dissects the pharyngeal wall. Complete the incision via the aryepiglottic fold of the right side into the postcricoid region so that the pharynx can be separated from the larynx here by cutting around the aryepiglottic fold of the right side, which is completely consumed by the tumor. Further dissection caudally at the posterior edge of the larynx up to the cricoid cartilage plate. The larynx is then deposited below the cricoid cartilage. Examination of the specimen. The tumor is resected in sano. Despite this, marginal samples are taken from the base of the tongue. It appears that the tumor may have invaded this area. The tissue appears conspicuously hardened and somewhat restless, so that a small portion of the base of the tongue is resected first. A marginal sample is then taken for a frozen section assessment. Also take marginal samples from both pharyngeal side walls and the postcricoid region. All marginal samples are assessed as tumor-free. Insertion of the Provox prosthesis in the form of a Provox 2 size 6 at the typical location. Subsequent closure of the pharynx after myotomy on both sides. The pharynx is closed with single button sutures and then in a second layer using continuous sutures. TachoSil is glued to the ends on both sides and to the intersection of the horizontal and vertical pharyngeal suture. Suture the infrahyoid muscles in front of the pharynx again. Then release the medial parts of the insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to prevent the tracheostoma from sinking in deeply for later treatment. Repeated careful hemostasis. Insertion of large Redon drains into the neck on both sides. Two-layer wound closure of the apron flap and circular suturing of the tracheostoma. Application of a pressure bandage on both sides. A nasogastric tube was placed in the patient at the beginning of the operation. This is now reattached and remains in place. The patient received intravenous antibiotics preoperatively and at the end of the operation, which were to be continued for 3 days postoperatively. Final consultation with the anesthesia department. The patient is kept awake in the in-house intensive care unit for monitoring.","Laryngectomy, Neck dissection

CT showed deep infiltration of the ................... so that primary transcervical resection and flap coverage had to be planned. Radial flap not possible in the planning, therefore defect coverage planned as ALT.","First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The exophytic tumor is seen in the tonsillar lobe area extending from the palatine arch down to the hypoharyngeal entrance, involving the base of the tongue, on the edge of the tongue on the left side, tumor extends medially over the vallecula and lingual epiglottis to just above the midline, here in the supraglottic area. Base of tongue palpatorily affected up to the midline. Indication for surgery with flap coverage confirmed. Now repositioning of the patient. Injection not possible due to the cardiologic situation. Start with extended radical neck dissection on the left: Typical skin incision in front of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This shows that the lymph node package has infiltrated the muscle in the middle and cranial area. The muscle is therefore removed cranially and caudally and also resected. Further dissection shows infiltration of the internal jugular vein, which is separated slightly below the exit of the inferior thyroid and ligated twice. However, the external jugular vein was preserved during dissection, and a supraclavicular vein and an additional outlet from the internal jugular vein, which could be used as a vascular anastomosis, can also be seen in the lower area. Further dissection shows infiltration of the lymph node conglomerate in the submandibular gland, hence resection of this gland and the caudal parotid pole as well as the digastric musculature. There is also infiltration of the external carotid artery. This must be placed just above the bulb and is supplied here by means of bypasses. The facial artery, lingual artery, superior thyroid artery and all other cranial ascending branches up to the superficial temporal artery must be resected and ligated. The external carotid artery is ligated twice cranially. It becomes apparent that the tumor is in contact with the primary tumor, so that per continuitatem growth at the level of the hyoid bone and in the area of the resected external carotid artery must be suspected. This is followed by repositioning for first transoral and then transcervical combined resection of the oropharyngeal carcinoma. First insertion of the tonsillar blocker from the transoral side, alternating with oral blockers. Tongue ligation. Tumor is incised on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm to 2 cm. This involves resection of the palatal arch from the uvula to the left, all tissue up to the lower jaw, whereby the periosteum is pushed away from the lower jaw. Pterygoid muscles are resected per continuitatem through the wall. The internal carotid artery is checked from the side here. The posterior wall of the oropharynx is resected almost to the middle. The posterior half of the tongue is initially resected superficially and only later in the tongue base area beyond the midline. The mobilized specimen is finally pulled through transcervically and the mucosa is resected under visualization up to the piriform sinus entrance in the oropharyngeal side wall area. The entire vallecula, the epiglottis and the base of the tongue are resected medially until a residual portion of approx. 25 % remains. This is still well supplied with blood. On the opposite side, the more cranial base of the tongue is still preserved and the caudal part is resected together with the vallecula. Resection ends at the beginning of the supraglottic area after removal of the epiglottis. The entire preparation and a marginal sample from the palatal arch and from the area of the base of the tongue and vallecula on the right side are sent in. Here the specimen on all sides in healthy tissue, including basal, cranial and caudal as well as the marginal specimens are also tumor-free. The intraoperative situation is therefore R0. Neck dissection now follows on the right side. Skin incision in the typical manner, dissection of the fat lymph node package of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The lymph node is adherent to the facial vein and internal jugular vein, but can be dissected here while preserving the vessels. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Final exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossus. Development of the dorsal neck preparation while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Subsequent development of the anterior neck preparation. The result is a neck dissection level II to V on the right side and Ib to V on the left side. Now the tracheostoma is created in the typical manner. Longitudinal section between the neck sections. Depiction of the trachea. Entering the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Small, broadly pedunculated Björk flap. This is epithelized in a typical manner. Re-intubation and insertion of laryngectomy tube. The defect is then covered using a pectoralis major flap: The planned defect coverage using a free flap proves to be unfeasible intraoperatively. The remaining residual stump of the left external carotid artery shows clear calcific plaques on palpation. If the patient has had an apoplexy, clamping without an increased risk of reapoplexy does not make sense here. Venous anastomosis on the left via the external jugular vein is possible. However, the arterial connection on the same side is missing. The evaluation of the vessels in the supraclavicular region also shows no corresponding possibilities for a vascular connection. ........................ The right side shows an external carotid artery, which is too short for a primary anastomosis of the ALT and also too small for a possible interposition. The first outlet appears to be a thyro-lingual artery. The transection of the lingual artery is not possible due to the previous resection of the opposite side. This also rules out the external carotid artery as an option for arterial anastomosis. The only remaining option is to use a pectoralis major flap to cover the defect. The patient is therefore repositioned. Sterile covering of the entire thoracic area up to the upper abdomen. After measuring the length of the flap pedicle and the size of the skin island, the island is marked according to the extent and shape of the defect. A subfascial skin bridge is then created from the neck area to the lower end of the marked deltopectoral flap, which is not lifted distally. Then expose the pectoralis major muscle and expose the vascular pedicle. The flap is then cut to the appropriate size and length and securing sutures are placed. The flap has a length of 11 1/2 cm and a width of 6 cm in the distal area and 9 cm in the proximal area. Successive development of the flap on its muscle pedicle including the vascular nerve bundle up to the clavicle. The flap is then pulled under the skin bridge. Insertion of the flap into the oropharyngeal defect. The flap is first sutured cranially, including the palatal arch. Caudally, the flap extends to the piriform sinus entrance, it then swivels towards the supraglottic area. The skin island is sutured directly supraglottically to the thyroid cartilage. Complete low-tension closure of the defect. Subsequent layer-by-layer closure of the thoracic wound after skin mobilization, which is successful without tension. Skin closure after extensive hemostasis with insertion of 2 Redon drains. On the left cervical side, tension-free closure over the pedicle after radical neck dissection with insertion of 2 Redon drains. On the right, the wound is closed with the insertion of a Redon drain. An 8-gauge tracheostomy tube is inserted into the tracheostoma. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit postoperatively and ventilated. Antibiotic treatment, which was started intraoperatively, is continued with Unacid for one week. In the case of circulatory instability or previous cardiological illness and due to the use of Plavix or previous heparinization, the operation was characterized by a diffuse bleeding tendency in the advanced course. Factor replacement and preservatives were necessary. Post-operative nutrition via the inserted PEG for 10 days, followed by gruel and then, if necessary, diet reconstruction. Overall cT4a cN2c findings and continuous growth on the left. Postoperative RCT recommended if the patient's condition permits.","Resection and flap coverage, Pedicled flap (Pectoralis major)

Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.,"First induction of anesthesia and intubation with a laser tube transorally via the anesthesia colleagues. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and identification of the tumor. This is very difficult as the tumor has been reduced in size by the biopsy and only a scarred area is visible. A sample is therefore taken from this area to ensure that the tumor is resected correctly. The frozen section of this sample shows at least a carinoma in situ and suspected invasive carcinoma matching the preliminary histology and after consultation with the pathology department it is the site described. Therefore, insertion of the DaVinci oral retractor. Insertion of camera and dissection arm and dissector arm. The tumor is now robotically sectioned using monopolar coagulation and the specimen is thread-marked for the frozen section. In the frozen section, there is still invasive tumor in the basal/caudal margin. For this reason, a large resection is made here, thread-marked and also sent to the frozen section. Neither carcinoma in situ nor invasive carcinoma can now be detected at the basal and mucosal margins remote from the tumor, i.e. a definitive R0 situation. Moderate bleeding occurs during the post-resection, which is monopolar coagulated and thus stopped. Due to the relatively large wound area at the base of the tongue, a protective tracheotomy must be performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Skin incision below the cricoid cartilage for this. Dissection down to the trachea. Cut through the thyroid isthmus and enter the trachea between the second and third tracheal cartilage. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Re-intubation to an 8 mm tracheal cannula and completion of the procedure without complications. The patient goes to the intensive care unit awake for monitoring.","Robot-assisted tumor resection, Tracheotomy

Entering with 0° optics and inspection of the tumor. The tumor is located on the left side, completely infiltrating the vocal folds. Pass the tumor region and look subglottically. Here, there is a slight extension in the subglottic slope. The subglottis itself and the trachea are tumor-free. Intubation by the anesthesia colleagues transnasally. Entry with the small bore tube and re-inspection of the tumor region. It is clear that the tumor extends very far caudally in the area of the arytenoid cartilage. A visible mucosal infiltration extends as far as the arytenoid cartilage. The arytenoid cartilage itself is distended and thickened, suggesting a submucosal infiltration. Decision to perform a laryngectomy due to the age and extent of the tumor. Esophageal entrance and piriform sinus on both sides are free. Sterile washing and covering after injection. Creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Start with neck dissection on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the neck levels IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. There are several spherical and suspicious masses on all sides, especially in levels II and III. Exposure of the hyoid bone. Detachment of the hyoid bone on the left side. Detachment of the cervical vascular sheath from the larynx and pharyngeal region. Detachment of the thyroid gland. Exposure of the upper laryngeal bundle. Coagulation of the upper laryngeal bundle and transection of the upper laryngeal bundle. Turning to the opposite side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, submandibular gland, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Clearing out the neck levels IIa to Va. There are several suspicious lymph nodes, especially in levels IIa and b. Exposure of the hyoid bone here as well. Release of the hyoid bone. Removal of the hyoid bone. Exposure of the superior laryngeal nerve, A. and V. laryngea. Separation of these. Detachment of the cervical vascular sheath from the larynx and pharyngeal region and detachment of the thyroid gland. Detachment of the infrahyal musculature and the laryngeal musculature. Performing the tracheotomy between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Transfer intubation to a laryngectomy tube. Start skeletonization of the larynx on the right side. Release and push off the piriform sinus, same procedure on the left side. Here the piriform sinus can only be partially released, as this is the tumor side. Enter the pharynx at the level of the epiglottis from the right side. Pull out the epiglottis through the pharyngotomy and incise the mucosa along the edge of the epiglottis up to the arytenoid region. Here, detachment of the mucosa caudally from the arytenoid cartilage. Detachment and separation of the larynx. In the area of the piriform sinus on the left side, the mucosa and soft tissue are resected again and a marginal sample is taken. Unfortunately, this marginal sample still shows carcinoma. Therefore, a large resection and another marginal sample are taken. This marginal sample is ultimately tumor-free. Creation of an esophagotracheal fistula and insertion of a size 10 Provox prosthesis (Provox 1). Perform the pharyngeal suture in a three-layered manner as usual. Reduction of the insertions of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and insertion of Redon drains. Incision of the skin in the area of the tracheostoma and two-layer wound closure. The operation is completed without complications. The patient goes to the intensive care unit in an awake state. Please continue antibiotics for 24 hours.

Indication for the above-mentioned operation.,"First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: insertion of the Kleinsasser tube of medium size. The clearly exophytic tumor can be seen, which has consumed about 75% of the epiglottis, the tumor runs over the arytenoid fold onto the medial anterior and lateral wall in the area of the piriform sinus or pharyngeal side wall. Tumor does not appear to be optimally displaceable, particularly in the area of the vallecula, where infiltration is also evident; deeper growth is likely in the case of ulceration. The base of the tongue is not affected. In conjunction with the CT, where an infiltration of the pre-epiglottic space up to the hyoid bone is described and the proximity of the tumor to vessels, lymph node metastases. Decision to proceed primarily from the outside after discussing the findings with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. PEG insertion (<CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME>): Insertion of the esophagoscope in a typical manner. Advance into the stomach, where a 9-bore abdominal wall tube is inserted in the typical manner after a diaphanoscopy has been performed. Fixation of this. Then sterile draping, injection of a total of 12 ml xylocaine 1% with arenalin in the area of the neck on both sides. Then marking of a platysmal flap for possible defect coverage in case of pharyngeal wall infestation. Then elevation of an apron flap subplatysmal including the platysmal flap to be elevated. The platysmal flap is dissected in its skin island and lifted from the neck skin, including the subcutaneous tissue. However, dissection is not carried out up to the chin; this should only be done during the final flap suture. Dissection of the apron flap up to the level of the hyoid bone and submandibular gland on both sides. This is followed by radical neck dissection on the right: a large lymph node package is seen on the right. This is difficult to separate from the sternocleidomastoid muscle, so that the muscle is partially resected here. However, an actual infiltration is not recognizable. Depiction of the digastric muscle, omohyoid muscle. Depiction of the internal jugular vein. This appears clearly infiltrated after dissection of some lymph nodes in the middle area. Exposure of the vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and internal and external carotid artery. Depiction of the hypoglossal nerve. This can be dissected away from the lymph node conglomerate with some effort. Infiltrated internal jugular vein is resected in the middle area and double ligated cranially and caudally. Then develop the entire lymph node conglomerate together with the dorsal neck preparation, whereby some branches of the cervical plexus are also embedded in the conglomerate and must therefore also be resected. However, the most important branches including the phrenic nerve can be preserved. Subsequently, development of the anterior neck preparation with ligation of the superior thyroid artery. Then modified radical neck dissection on the left: Exposure of the omohyoid and digastric muscles as on the opposite side. Inclusion of the submandibular gland capsule as on the opposite side. Dorsal neck preparation is developed with exposure of the internal jugular vein, carotid artery, vagus nerve and accessorius nerve. Removal is performed while preserving all cervical plexus structures. Subsequent development of the anterior neck preparation as on the opposite side. The superior thyroid artery is preserved. The hypoglossal nerve is also exposed and preserved. Then tumor resection: separation of the suprahyoid muscles from the right to the paramedian left. Exposure of hyoid bone. Exposure of ..................... superior. Detachment of the constrictor pharyngis muscle. All soft tissue behind the hyoid bone up to the larynx is also resected. Entry into the left paramedian larynx. Exposure of the epiglottis. After cutting around the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1-1.5 cm on all sides. Part of the left pharyngeal wall up to the middle of the lateral wall and the entire supraglottic area including both aryepiglottic folds are removed, leaving the thyroid cartilage intact. Vallecula and caudalmost parts of the base of the tongue are also resected. Tumor clearly removed in healthy tissue. Tumor is thread-marked. Marginal samples are taken from the arytenoid region as well as a resection in the tongue base region and a marginal sample in the tongue base region. The marginal samples and the marked tumor specimen are sent for frozen section diagnosis. Tumor in healthy tissue removed at the preoparate, marginal samples also tumor-free. Thus R0 resection. This is followed by complete irrigation of the entire wound area with H202 and Ringer's solution and careful hemostasis. The lingual artery is prophylactically ligated on the right side and severed. The lingual artery and superior thyroid artery on the tumor side are ligated and severed. The superior laryngeal nerve is preserved on both sides. Reconstruction as after Alonso resection. The posterior dorsal pharyngeal wall areas are adapted on the left and especially on the right using 3.0 single-button Vircyl sutures so that the defect remains towards the thyroid cartilage. The piriform sinus entrance is preserved. The arytenoid cartilage is exposed on the right side. Soft tissue largely removed up to the thyroid cartilage towards the front. The thyroid cartilage is then sutured with several Vicryl 0 sutures so that the thyroid cartilage comes to lie under the hyoid bone. This ensures stable and complete closure of the defect. The infrahyoid musculature is then sutured back to the hyoid bone. Before the tumor resection, a tracheostoma was also created. Here, the thyroid isthmus was exposed in a typical manner, passed underneath, clamped and supplied by means of stab ligatures. A Björk flap similar to a virsier flap was then created and epithelized in the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. This was followed by reintubation and insertion of a laryngectomy tube. The wound area was then irrigated again with H202 and Ringer's solution and careful hemostasis was performed. The wound was then closed in layers with epithelialization of the tracheostoma and re-suturing of the skin island of the platysmal flap. A Redon drain was inserted on both sides. Finally, reintubation and insertion of a 7-gauge tracheostomy tube. The patient received Unacid 3 g i.v. intraoperatively. Please continue this antibiotic treatment for one week. Please feed patient via PEG for 7-10 days. Afterwards, if necessary, gruel swallowing and diet build-up. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring.","Partial laryngeal resection according to Alonso, Right pharyngeal partial resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheostomy, PEG placement, Endoscopy

When the tumor growth was insufficiently reduced both clinically and on PET-CT, a laryngectomy was indicated.","Introductory consultation with the anesthetist. First placement of the nasogastric feeding tube. Then injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline and preparation of an apron flap. Dissection of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides. First expose the cervical vascular sheath on the right side. The venous vessels in particular are extremely fragile. There is therefore a greatly increased tendency to bleed and the surgical conditions are very difficult. First dissection of the lateral neck preparation. Tearing of the internal jugular vein, which must be sutured over. The vessel can thus be preserved in its continuity. Dissection of the accessorius nerve. Displacement to the cranial side and re-embedding of the nerve at the end of the operation in the sense of neurolysis. The same procedure is used for the vagus nerve, but it is moved medially. Re-embedding of the nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Same procedure for the hypoglossal nerve. Displacement to the cranial side and at the end of the operation re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Finally, dissection of the entire neck preparation of levels Ib, II, III, IV and V. Subsequent separation of the upper pole of the thyroid gland from the trachea and the laryngeal skeleton. Exposure of the hyoid bone. Transition to neck dissection on the left side. This shows a lymph node conglomerate in the area of the venous angle. Caudal exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Here, too, the situation is the same as on the other side of the neck. With very fragile vessels, there is a significantly increased tendency to bleed here. The preparation conditions are also very difficult here. First attempt at long-distance dissection of the cervical vascular sheath. However, it then becomes apparent that the conglomerate is firmly attached to the venous angle and cannot be separated. Therefore, first expose the internal jugular vein cranially and caudally. This is first looped here. Dissect caudally and separate the vein. Stitch around the distal vein stump. Dissection on the common carotid artery. Dissection is performed cranially up to the carotid bifurcation. The conglomerate can also be seen here to be firmly fused to the external carotid artery. The adventitia is partially resected from the artery in order to separate the conglomerate in sano from the external carotid artery. The specimen can be easily separated on the internal carotid artery. The vagus nerve is also dissected over a long distance. This can also be separated from the lymph node conglomerate with difficulty, but nevertheless in sano. The nerve remains completely intact in its continuity. Same procedure for the hypoglossal nerve. Displacement and re-embedding of the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. The course of the accessory nerve must also be dissected sharply from the preparation in part, but its continuity is also preserved. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Finally, the entire conglomerate can be removed from the carotid artery and the jugular vein can be traced further upwards. Proximal removal of the internal jugular vein. Stitch around the proximal venous stump. The same is done with the facial vein. Finally, the entire conglomerate can be removed together with the lateral neck preparation. Touch up in the area of the accessorius triangle. Finally, this also results in a neck dissection of levels Ib to V. Here too, separation of the thyroid gland from the laryngeal skeleton. Dissection of the anterior surface of the trachea after cutting through the thyroid isthmus. Opening of the trachea between the 1st and 2nd cartilage clasp and extubation of the patient and insertion of a laryngectomy tube into the distal trachea. Further exposure of the hyoid bone. Finally, opening of the pharynx caudal to the hyoid bone. Successive detachment of the epiglottis and recutting of the epiglottis on the right side over the arytenoid cusps. Partial resection of the pharynx on the left side, where a scarred change is visible in the former tumor area. This entire area is also resected. Finally, the incision is brought together below the arytenoid hump. Further separation of the laryngeal skeleton from the pharynx. The pharynx was first removed from the thyroid cartilage margins. The preparation is then made up to caudal to the cricoid cartilage so that the preparation can be removed in toto. Removal of a marginal sample from the lateral edge of the pharynx on the left side, which is assessed as tumor-free in the frozen section. This shows an R0 resection after all other margins were far away from the tumor. Subtle hemostasis. Closure of the pharynx in three layers. Reconstruction of the infrahyoid musculature, which is also closed before the pharynx. Before closing the pharynx, first perform a paramedian myotomy on the left side. Also insertion of a voice valve prosthesis. This is done retrogradely without any problems. The Provox prosthesis is positioned at a typical location on the upper edge of the tracheostoma to be reconstructed later. Shortening of the medial parts of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the base of the clavicle. Repeated subtle hemostasis. Insertion of a Redon drain into the neck on both sides. Fold back the apron flap, which is sutured in two layers. Application of a pressure bandage. Intubation of the patient onto a size 10 tracheostomy tube. Final consultation with the anaesthetist. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is transferred to the in-house intensive care unit for monitoring.","Laryngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Nasogastric feeding tube

Injection of 5 ml Ultracaine with added Suprarenin along the skin incision. Sterile abjoration. Marking of the skin incision. It runs in a line 5 cm long between the cricoid and a point 2 transverse fingers above the jugulum along the median line on the neck. Now sharply cut through the skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma with the 15 mm scalpel. The anterior jugular vein is exposed and is ligated and cut. Further dissection in depth. The linea alba and the infrahyoid musculature are found. Here dissection after bipolar coagulation. The thyroid gland is now revealed. With the Overholt clamp, the thyroid isthmus is undercut and bipolarly coagulated. A visor tracheotomy is performed between the 3rd and 4th tracheal ring and mucocutaneous anastomosis with Ethibond sutures in the typical manner. Then insertion with the flexible gastroesophagoscope and placement of the PEG through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Entry with the gastroesophagoscope and air insufflation into the stomach. Once in the stomach, endoscopy of the cardia after inversion of the endoscope. A spontaneous diaphanoscopy can now be seen. A PEG is now placed in loco typico on the anterior wall of the stomach using the suture pull-through method. This was performed without any problems. The patient received Unacid 3 g i.v. perioperatively. Then sterile washing and draping and positioning of the patient and start of inspection of the tumor region by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The tumor extends from the right tonsil to the right palatal arch, passes to the uvula and also extends to the left palatal arch, covering the anterior and posterior palatal arch and the entire soft palate. On the right side, the entire tonsil is tumorously altered and also the pharyngeal side wall up to the vallecula. The base of the tongue is only marginally affected. Now start with transoral tumor resection in the area of the soft palate, the uvula and the soft palate. Then further dissection along the pharyngeal side wall and in the area of the medial parts of the pharynx. Then perform the neck dissection on the right side. To do this, expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the submandibular gland, the omohyoid and digastric muscles, the accessorius and hypoglossal nerves and the cervical vascular sheath. Then removal of the metastases and the neck preparation from level II a to V a. Unfortunately, parts of the cervical plexus and the hypoglossal nerve must also be resected here. Then continue the tumor resection from transcervical. To do this, the submandibular gland must be removed and the digastric muscle severed. Then disluxate the tumor and remove the remaining tumor tissue. In the area of the medial pharyngeal border, the tumor resection appears relatively close. A generous resection and a marginal specimen are performed here. Ultimately, all margin samples in the frozen section are R0. Parallel to the tumor resection, the radialis graft is lifted. Due to the resection, the radialis graft is relatively narrow in the caudal section. The pharynx must be gathered here. Carry out the neck dissection on the left side through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>.Enter with the 15 mm scalpel and make a skin incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle from the mastoid to the caudal, in a curved line along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sharp transection of the skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma. The external jugular vein is exposed, ligated and cut. The platysma flap is now dissected using a scalpel. Dissection along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in depth. The accessorius nerve is now exposed and protected. The accessory nerve is followed in a cranial direction and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle can now be seen. Further medially, the submandibular gland can be seen, which is also easily visualized. The omohyoid muscle is visible caudally. The cervical vascular sheath is visible in the depth below several neck metastases. The internal jugular vein is exposed from caudal to cranial. There is no injury to the structures here. The superior thyroid vein and facial vein are dissected and spared. Medial to the jugular vein, the common carotid artery and the external carotid artery are exposed as well as the vagus nerve and the cervical artery. The neck preparation is now detached in level II b, followed by level II a while sparing the accessorius nerve, and levels III/IV and V are also detached without difficulty. The plexus branches are visualized and specifically spared. No chyle fistula occurs caudally when the neck preparation is removed. The anterior neck preparation is now also exposed and dissected along the facial vein and the superior thyroid vein. Clinically clear evidence of multiple cervical lymph node metastases on the left side. Thus cN2c neck status. The hypoglossal nerve is shown cranially; the nerve is also clearly spared on this side. Elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders (13 x 7 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Defect coverage of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. The graft is sutured in place by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who also performs the anastomosis in the area of the neck vessels. After removal of the radial artery flap, it is flushed with heparin solution. Insertion of the flap into the defect. It becomes apparent that the defect size slightly exceeds the flap size due to the post-resection. However, the flap can be sutured successively into the defect without tension, sometimes with the sutures in place. Sutures with single button sutures 3-0 Vicryl. The entire defect is successfully covered, except for a small portion in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Here the flap is sutured to the prevertebral fascia. Otherwise, the base of the tongue, pharyngeal side wall and palatal arch area are covered. A gastric tube is inserted to ensure the nasopharyngeal passage. The stalk passed through the right side of the neck is then anastomosed. The superior thyroid artery is selected for the anastomosis. After conditioning, this is sutured to the radial artery or anastomosed with 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. Subsequent conditioning of the cephalic vein. This is relatively poorly patency distally, but after cutting it back there is good venous return further proximally. The accompanying vein of the radial artery is selected as the 2nd connecting vein, which is, however, very thin. After conditioning the vessels with a 2.5 mm coupler, the cephalic vein is anastomosed with a venous outlet from the middle thyroid vein. Good venous flow after opening the clamps, positive smear phenomenon. The remaining part of the cephalic vein is clipped. The small accompanying vein of the radial vein is anastomosed with another outlet from the thyroid vein using a 1.5 mm coupler after conditioning the vessel ends. Here too, after opening the clamps, good flow, good venous return and positive smear phenomenon. Enoral flap control shows good aspect. Subsequent irrigation of the right side of the neck, hemostasis, layered wound closure and insertion of a total of 2 flaps. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma. This is fixed with stitches. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Flap monitoring for 5 days according to the scheme clinically and via the marked area of the vascular pedicle using vascular Doppler. Continue antibiotics started intraoperatively for a total of 1 week. Feeding via the PEG tube. After approx. 10 days, gruel swallowing and, if necessary, diet build-up. After receiving the final histology, presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy, PEG placement

Patient identification, consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Carrying out the team time-out. Induction of anesthesia and intubation by anesthesia colleagues. Tracheobronchoscopy is not possible here if intubation conditions are difficult. Now intubation with the small bore tube. No suspicious mass in the oral cavity, oropharynx, base of tongue, vallecula, epiglottis, aryepiglottic f......s and postcricoid area. The mass/tumor grows from the pocket fold on the left, completely infiltrating the vocal fold and extending over the anterior commissure to the vocal fold on the right, growing circularly on the left and extending 2 cm to the subglottic area. Skin disinfection of the surgical area. Infiltration anesthesia in the area of the apron flap. Repeated skin disinfection of the surgical area and sterile draping of the surgical area. Now mark the landmarks, jugulum, mastoid, chin, sternocleidomastoid anterior border, jaw angle and mandibular branch on both sides and mark the apron flap up to approximately 2 to 3 cm cranial to the jugulum. Make the skin incision using an electric needle through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequently, further preparation of the neck dissection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First cut through the platysma and develop the apron flap subplatysmal to cranial. This is fixed with holding sutures. Then expose the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid and dissect along it. Exposure of the omohyoid and exposure of the right mandibular salivary gland. Exposure of the digaster venter muscle anteriorly and posteriorly. Visualization of the auricularis magnus. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and protection of the same. Demonstration of findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. He recommends dissecting only level II from the jugular vein medially and an identical procedure on the opposite side. This is carried out. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, the jugular vein and the facial vein. All structures are spared. An enlarged lymph node is located in the jugulofacial angle, which does not appear to be primarily suspicious. This neck specimen is sent for final histology. Now identical procedure on the opposite side. The external jugular vein is exposed and spared. The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid, the omohyoid and the posterior and anterior digaster venter muscles and the mandibular salivary gland as well as the hypoglossus and the accessorius are also exposed and spared. The neck preparation is also dissected medially from the jugular vein and cranially from the bifurcation to the medial side. A lymph node is also enlarged here, but not suspicious. The facial vein and internal jugular vein are also exposed and spared here. Now expose the omohyoid muscle and skeletonize it. The tumor is now resected: the hyoid bone is exposed and the infrahyoid muscles are dissected on both sides, detached from the larynx and folded laterally and caudally. Detachment of the supraglottic soft tissues up to the pharyngeal wall. The soft tissues go with the larynx to the specimen. Expose the thyroid isthmus and cut it. Dissect the thyroid gland together with the overlying infrahyoid musculature caudolaterally from the laryngeal skeleton. This is done in the same way on both sides. Individual branches of the superior thyroid artery are supplied or ligated bipolarly, the artery remains intact on both sides. Exposure of the trachea on the upper 4 to 5 cm. The trachea is now opened in the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space with epithelialization of the caudal part. No tumor here. Then expose the cornu superius on both sides and detach the pharyngeal muscles or the constrictor pharyngis on both sides. Push off the piriform sinus on both sides. Subsequent entry into the pharyngeal space at the level of the epiglottis. Exposure of the tumor. Successive development of the larynx. Detachment below the postcricoid region from the esophageal tube. Subsequent separation of the larynx from the trachea, which remains slightly elongated dorsally towards the cranium. Larynx is suture-marked for frozen section. In the frozen section, the tumor is relatively close dorsally in the area of the cricoid cartilage, no tumor infestation in the area of the trachea, here the clearly subglottically growing carcinoma is tumor-free or removed in healthy tissue. Resection of soft tissue on the esophageal tube from paramedian right to left is now performed again. A portion of the caudal hypopharynx in the area of the postcricoid mucosa is also removed again. Both specimens are sent for frozen section. No more tumor infiltrates here, so the tumor is finally removed from the healthy tissue. The myotomy is now performed in the typical manner on the left. Significantly improved by passage of the finger. Muscle bundles are cut through to the mucosa. Subsequent insertion of an 8 mm Provox prosthesis in the typical manner without problems. Good fit. Then 1st inverting suture with 4.0 Vicryl single button sutures inverting. A 2nd inverting suture of the musculature is performed over the 1st suture, also in single button sutures with Vicryl 3.0. Then a 3rd suture with adaptation of the constrictor pharyngis musculature, suprahyoidal constrictor pharyngis muscle is also adapted to the supraglottic musculature. The thyroid gland is adapted caudally over the suture area. Subsequent careful irrigation and hemostasis of the entire area. Wound closure in layers without insertion of a Redon drain in each side of the neck and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Finally, insertion of a 10 mm tracheostomy tube. The procedure was completed without complications. Overall cT3 to 4 transglottic carcinoma on the left side, no clear clinical lymph node involvement observed. Further procedure after receipt of the final histology. Presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference. Postoperatively, the patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit.

Level II shows clearly enlarged lymph node metastases. Otherwise identical procedure. Dissection along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Identification of the omohyoid muscle, the posterior digastric venter muscle and the accessorius nerve and dissection of the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the accessorius nerve. The metastases can also be removed from the vessel. Subsequent formation of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the accessorius nerve and the plexus branches. Exposure, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve. Then resection of the medial neck preparation while sparing the hypoglossal nerve and the facial vein. Creation of a Redon drainage, two-layer wound closure. Pressure dressing. Transition to tracheotomy: X-shaped skin incision. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Spreading of the pretracheal muscles. Identification of the cricoid cartilage. The thyroid isthmus is revealed very far caudally and is only bipolized. Then open the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Formation of a Björk flap and epithelialization of the flap using six tracheostomy sutures. PEG placement: Flexible esophagogastroscopy. After positive diaphanoscopy, placement of the PEG tube in the typical manner using the thread pull-through method. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Subsequent combined transoral transcervical tumor resection: First dissection of the pharyngeal wall and dissection of all vessels from the outside. Cut around the tumor from the inside transorally as far as possible. This can be done cranially and along the lower jaw. Controlled dissection from the inside to the outside. Inclusion of the entire pharyngeal wall. Extraction of the tumor into the soft tissues of the neck. Further resection with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm on all sides. The tonsil lobe, pharyngeal side wall, glossotonsillar groove and base of the tongue up to half as well as parts of the vallecula and the pharyngeal wall up to the hypopharyngeal entrance were removed. As part of the resection, the submandibular gland was also resected as well as parts of the external tongue musculature with parts of the hyoid bone. The tumor is thread-marked after resection. Marginal samples are taken from the hypopharynx and from the area of the pharyngeal wall extending to the uvula, from the base of the tongue, from the body of the tongue and a marginal sample from the alveolar ridge, which extends to the base of the tongue via the glossotonsillar groove. No evidence of carcinoma in any of the marginal samples. No high-grade dysplasia. Therefore R0 situation. After measuring the defect in its three-dimensional dimensions, removal of the radial lobe on the left forearm: Flap length maximum 10 cm, width maximum 7 cm. Flap shape is adjusted to the defect towards the floor of the mouth and base of the tongue. First cut ulnarly and lift subfascially. The ulnar artery is carefully spared. The incision is then extended into the antecubital fossa. First expose the superficial venous system and dissect it. Then expose the pedicle under the brachioradialis. Then incision of the flap from radial and subfascial elevation. The antebrachial cutaneous nerve is carefully spared. Caudal clamping of the radial artery. Saturation always at 100%. After approx. 15 minutes without a drop in saturation, the radial artery is removed. This is stitched and ligated with 4.0 Ethilon single button sutures. This is done both proximally and distally. Lift the flap subfascially with the pedicle and superficial venous system successively up to the antecubital fossa. Outgoing vessels are either ligated, bipolar coagulated or treated with a clip. Exposure in the antecubital fossa, connection between superficial and deep venous system. Exposure of the radial artery. The interosseous artery is first clamped off and can be supplied with clips and cut after a constant saturation of 100%. No confluence of the radial artery can be shown. Two outlets from the area of the cephalic vein can be visualized, which can be considered as connecting vessels. The flap is then removed. The veins are ligated. The artery is treated with 6.0 Vascufil stitches. Careful hemostasis is then performed. Removal of an appropriately sized piece of full-thickness skin from the groin area. After skin mobilization, the skin is closed in several layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. The full-thickness skin is inserted into the forearm defect after appropriate thinning. Fixation using 4.0 Ehtilon sutures. Skin closure up to the crook of the elbow in layers. Application of a hydrogel/Mepilex dressing. Application of Wölkchen compresses on top. Wrapping in absorbent cotton. Application or adjustment of a Kramer splint and wrapping of the arm in a functional position using an elastic bandage on the Kramer splint. Saturation always at 100%. Positioning of the arm. Insertion and suturing of the flap into the pharyngeal defect: passing the stem through to the soft tissues of the neck. Successive suturing of the flap into the defect using 3.0 Vicryl single button sutures according to the three-dimensional arrangement without tension. Suturing is performed partly transorally, partly transcervically and partly with the sutures in place. Complete tension-free closure. Subsequent conditioning of the flap vessels and conditioning of the connecting vessels. The lingual artery is selected. It is conditioned and anastomosed to the radial artery using 8.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. Subsequent conditioning of the larger vein from the area of the cephalic vein. Conditioning of the facial vein. Selection of a 3.5 mm coupler. Anastomosis of the veins without difficulty using a coupler. Good venous return after opening the clamps. Positive smear phenomenon. The other outlet on the cephalic vein is clipped.

Therefore indication for the above-mentioned operation.,"After induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues, the surgeon first performs a tracheoscopy using the 0 degree scope. Tracheoscopy is only possible up to approx. 1 cm subglottically. Here, the mucosal conditions are unremarkable with no evidence of stenosis. Subsequent nasal intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Start of flexible esophagogastroscopy. Careful screening with the flexible endoscope through the oesophagus into the stomach. Chronic inflammatory mucosa on all sides of the stomach in the form of gastritis with no evidence of exophytic masses. Retraction of the flexible gastroscope and detailed inspection of the esophagus. Mucosal conditions unremarkable on all sides. Position the patient and first inspect the oral cavity. This reveals a carcinoma of the edge of the tongue on the right side, which occupies approximately the anterior third of the tongue and extends just to the midline, appearing coarse on palpation, with no abnormalities on palpation of the floor of the mouth and the base of the tongue. Entry with the type C small bore tube and inspection of the oropharynx and hypopharynx. Epiglottis, vallecula and base of tongue free on both sides, the piriform sinus can also be freely unfolded on both sides, the arytenoid region and postcricoid as well as the esophageal entrance are also free. Endolaryngeal protrusion is extremely difficult even with the type D small bore tube. The anterior commissure cannot be seen, otherwise inconspicuous mucosal conditions and smooth vocal folds without exophytic masses. Subsequent transition to excision biopsy of the right edge of the tongue. Insertion of an oral retractor and looping of the tongue with a Vicryl suture. Marking of the resection margins using monopolar coagulation and palpation. Subsequent excision of the tongue tumor after bipolar coagulation with scissors. Ligation of a small vein in the area of the floor of the mouth and suture marking of the removed tongue resectate. A resectate is obtained in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth. The samples taken are sent for final histology. Finally, careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Relaxation of the oral retractor and recheck.

Adjustment of the endolarynx with the Kleinsasser B and JA tube. Demonstration of the findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. This shows tumor growth in the area of the right vocal fold, which occupies the entire right vocal fold and extends to the vocal process. Towards the anterior commissure, this appears to be reached. Laterally, the tumor is palpable in the area of the ventricle. Subsequently, a decision was made to perform an open partial laryngectomy. Subsequent sterile washing and draping. Serrated vertical skin incision with exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature, which is pushed apart along the linea alba. Then expose the laryngeal skeleton by pushing the cricothyroid muscle from the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage to the thyrohyoid membrane. Incision of the periosteum or perichondrium so that a right pedicled perichondrium flap of the thyroid cartilage is formed. Enter the subperichondrial layer in the area of the thyroid incisura and dissect caudally. Then pass through the thyrofissure in the median plane so that the thyroid cartilage can be pushed apart. There is no clinical evidence of infiltration in the area of the anterior commissure. Entry into the interior of the larynx in the area of the thyroid incisura. From here, the incision is first made caudally in a vertical direction and the anterior commissure is included in the resection. In this way, the tumour can be successively visualized. The resection proceeds to the right, including the perichondrium in the area of the medial half of the right half of the thyroid cartilage. The tumor is then removed caudally in the area of the subglottis as well as cranially, whereby the resection includes parts of the ventriculus laryngeus. Finally, the tumor and thus the entire vocal fold is removed dorsally using the Kittel scissors with resection of the vocal process on the arytenoid cartilage. Macroscopically, the resection margins are not suspicious. The entire specimen is then thread-marked and mounted on cork for a frozen section histological examination. The dorsal part of the subglottic resection margin still shows carcinoma extensions. A subglottic dorsal resection is therefore performed. Lateral to this resection, further marginal samples are taken as well as a further marginal sample in the area of the remaining arytenoid cartilage. These proved to be free of tumor and dysplasia in the frozen section histological examination, so that an R0 resection can be assumed here. Finally, careful hemostasis by bipolar coagulation. Sealing of the wound surface on the right side with fibrin glue. Drill holes are made for readaptation of the thyroid cartilage. Insertion of a Keel after appropriate individual modeling. Readaptation of the thyroid cartilage skeleton at the previously created cranial and caudal drill holes. Refixation of the ligamentum conicum to the caudal edge of the thyroid cartilage. Knock-back of the perichondrium flap, which is additionally fixed with fibrin glue. Multi-layer wound closure of the straight prelaryngeal musculature after insertion of a drainage flap. Finally, multi-layer skin suture. Sterile wound dressing. End of the operation and transfer of the patient to anesthesia after placement of a nasogastric feeding tube and microlaryngoscopic control of the dry wound bed endolaryngeally. Conclusion: Complete right chordectomy for right vocal fold carcinoma via thyrofissure. Inclusion of the anterior commissure as well as the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage. Control microlaryngoscopy in 8 weeks.","Frontolateral laryngeal partial resection/Chordectomy

After induction of anesthesia, the tumor is inspected again. This extends from the soft palate close to the uvula down to the lower tonsillar pole with transition via the glossotonsillar groove to the base of the tongue. Laterally, the tumor appears to extend to the posterior molars. After insertion of the tonsil retractor and insertion of the monopolar electric needle, the tumor is cut around far into the healthy tissue and removed, taking the uvula, the soft palate on the left up to the hard palate border and the upper alveolar ridge, from here to the lower alveolar ridge. Removal of the last molar and preparation via the glossotonsillar groove to the base of the tongue. Removal of the tonsil in its capsule. Mucosa up to the buccal mucosa and the floor of the mouth as a post-resection. Then take lateral and medial edge samples. These are now found to be tumor-free. To confirm the R0 situation, the bed of the two extracted molars is now removed from the medial side to the lateral corticalis with the rose bur, taking the corticalis with it, so that a safe R0 resection appears to be given. Intraoperative demonstration on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Removal of the tonsil plug. The bridge of the maxilla breaks out at the front. It becomes apparent that the tooth roots could not be preserved, so these are also removed. A residual root may have remained on the left paramedian side. Therefore, request a postoperative maxillofacial consultation. In the further course, repositioning for neck dissection, starting on the left side: skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Laborious exploration of the neck vessels and preservation of the same for later defect coverage. Dissection in the accessorius triangle and exploration of the accessorius, the hypoglossus and the cervical sinus. Dissection from the digaster to the caudal omohyoid. Removal of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the above-mentioned structures and the main plexus branches. Then dissect the capsule of the submandibular gland in the midline. Dissect caudally, preserving the above-mentioned structures and remove the medial neck preparation. Careful hemostasis and H2O2 irrigation. Now dissection on the right side, essentially identical. Here too, the accessorius nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, the cervical sinus and the cervical vascular sheath can be located and spared. After removal of the lateral and medial neck specimen in regions I to V, careful hemostasis, H2O2 irrigation and insertion of a Redon drain are performed. Subsequently, two-layer wound closure. Now perform the tracheotomy. Skin incision. Subcutaneous preparation of the prelaryngeal musculature. Push them apart in the midline. Dissection of the thyroid gland. Undermining of the thyroid gland, clamping, severing and repositioning of both thyroid globules. Now locate the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a Björk flap with the 3rd tracheal cartilage. Epithelialization of the stoma. Now the intubation is transferred to an LE tube. Then lift the radial flap by cutting around the skin island. Locate the radial artery. Clamp it with the bulldog and observe the saturation while the flap pedicle is dissected from caudal to cranial. Locate the flap pedicle in the crook of the elbow. A relatively small artery and even finer veins can be seen. Therefore, renewed demonstration on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Decision to lift and use the flap despite difficult conditions. Separation of the radial artery caudally and cranially. Subsequent transection of the same. Now separation of the vein. Dissection of the same. Now lift the split skin from the right groin. This is primarily closed by inserting a Redon drain. The split skin is sutured into the lifting defect of the forearm, the rest of the forearm is closed in two layers accordingly. The flap is then fitted into the lifting defect orally. Suturing in the area of the soft palate and the tonsil and caudally with covering of the exposed bone. Passing the flap pedicle through an artificial fistula between the mandible and the submandibular gland. Then dissection of the superior thyroid artery and the internal jugular vein in preparation for anastomization. The thyroid artery is then removed and an end-to-end anastomosis of the superior thyroid artery to the radial artery is performed. Then end-to-side anastomosis of the accompanying veins in their confluence with the internal jugular vein. This is achieved without any problems using 9/0 sutures as microsurgical re-anastomization. Finally, two-layer wound closure with insertion of a Redon drain on the left side of the neck and completion of the procedure with a vital flap and no indication of complications.","Resection of Tonsillar carcinoma, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery was indicated.","First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The described, deeply exulcerating tumor in the hypopharynx on the left is visible, which grows up to the arytenoid fold on the left and involves the hypopharyngeal side wall and extends under the tonsillar lobe in the hypopharynx. On the other side, the flat, papillomatous tumor in the arytenoid region on the right is visible. The above-mentioned indication for surgery was confirmed. First skin disinfection. Injection of a total of 15 ml xylocaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. Sterile draping. Radical neck dissection on the left follows: Skin incision in the typical manner along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Extension at a 90° angle in the direction of the submandibular lobe. Subsequent exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular artery, internal and external carotid artery, vagus nerve, boundary cord of the accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. There is a large conglomerate of lymph nodes extending from caudal to cranial lateral to the cervical vascular sheath. It infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein and branches of the cervical plexus in the upper area. The internal jugular vein is dissected cranially and caudally from the tumor, is not affected here and is ligated twice. A caudal outlet remains in the direction of the thyroid gland. Cranial also double ligation. The internal carotid artery can be completely dissected. Caudal exposure of the thoracic duct or a large lymphatic vessel in the venous angle, which is ligated twice. The conglomerate is then removed laterally from the cervical vascular sheath, including the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein, the accessorius nerve and resection of the upper cervical plexus branches. Parts of the prevertebral, paravertebral musculature must also be removed. Here in the area of the strongest adherence of the lymph node preparation, marginal samples are taken, also from the upper end of the separated internal jugular vein. Both marginal samples are sent for frozen section. No tumor infiltrates here in the frozen section. All soft tissues, including parts of the trapezius muscle, were resected. Subsequent clearing of levels Ib and Ia, including the submandibular gland. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve and lingual nerve. Also preservation of the facial artery. Subsequent tumor resection: First exposure of the hyoid bone from the lateral or superior cornu. Insertion between hyoid bone and superior cornu. Exposure of the tumor. The tumor is incised on all sides with a safety margin of 1 to 1.5 cm. The entire lateral hypopharyngeal side wall and the posterior hypopharyngeal wall are removed; resection extends up to the base of the tongue and under the tonsillar lobe. Resection extends from the vallecula, next to the epiglottis downwards, including the aryepiglottic fold and the piriform sinus to the tip of the piriformis. The tumor is macroscopically removed from the healthy tissue and is thread-marked for frozen section. To be on the safe side, a lateral specimen is taken adjacent to the epiglottis, including parts of the base of the tongue and the cranial resection margin. In the frozen section, infiltrates in the lateral and cranial direction in the sense of a microinvasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ infiltrates. Therefore, resection laterally and cranially and removal of a marginal sample from the lateral, divided into lateral and caudal, including the remains of the arytenoid fold or the mucosa towards the postcricoid region and including further lateral parts of the epiglottis and vallecula region. Also resection again cranially and removal of a marginal sample, which extends from the base of the tongue over the lateral pharyngeal wall to the cranial border in the oropharynx. The frozen section is now free laterally, but there are still in situ infiltrates cranially. Therefore, another extensive resection of a wide mucosal strip is performed cranially. The marginal samples are taken transorally by inserting a Mc Ivor spatula. For this purpose, a cranial mucosal strip of the residual mucosa, which is already located behind the uvula, is removed as well as the residual tonsil and a strip from the side wall of the pharynx. All these marginal samples are sent to the frozen section again as a cranial marginal sample. No more tumor infiltrates here. Therefore, an R0 resection can now be assumed. Subsequently, resection of the 2nd carcinoma in the area of the arytenoid hump on the right. This is a flat, papillomatous carcinoma. This is macroscopically incised on all sides with a safety margin of several millimeters in healthy tissue and sent for frozen section examination with a suture marker. Here in the dorsal and lateral area still carcinoma in situ. Therefore, resection of the dorsal and lateral areas and removal of representative marginal samples. These are now tumor-free. Thus an R0 situation here too. However, extensive hypopharyngeal carcinoma with in situ can be assumed in the case of suspected field carcinoma and a second carcinoma in the case of suspected polycentric carcinoma. The residual mucosa in the postcricoid area is now readapted cranially as far as possible in order to achieve improved sensitivity and mucosal coverage using 5/0 Vicryl sutures. During the tumor resection, a plastic tracheostoma was created by reopening in the case of a post-dilatation tracheostomy. The old scar was reopened in the cranial region, the trachea was exposed and epithelialized in the 2nd and 3rd intercartilage space in a typical manner using a wide pedicle Björk flap. Insertion of a laryngectomy tube. Following the tumor resection Neck dissection on the right: Level II to IV as well as larger parts of V. Multiple suspicious nodes are also removed here. The internal jugular vein, internal/external carotid artery, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve, border cord and the branches of the cervical plexus were preserved here, as was the superior thyroid artery. A femoral flap was then removed from the left side to cover the defect. After measuring the defect, which required a size of 12 x 8 cm, a flap size of 17 x 8 cm was measured, as the flap is to be lifted with a skin island as a monitor. Several perforators can be displayed. The flap is outlined around the perforators. First cut medially through the skin and subcutis to the fascia. Dissect below the fascia up to the intermuscular septum. Widen the incision cranially and expose the vascular pedicle of the descending ramus. Also expose the perforators, which all extend through the musculature. The vascular pedicle is exposed up to the exit from the profunda femoris artery. Here the artery reaches a good thickness. Equally good venous confluence can be visualized. The flap is then incised laterally. After cutting through the fascia, a larger part of the vastus lateralis muscle is resected with the intermuscular course of the perforators, particularly in the caudal region. Outgoing branches are bipolarly coagulated or treated with a clip. The vascular pedicle is placed directly on the profunda femoris artery. Good reflux from the superficial circumflex iliac artery, which must be removed due to the anatomical conditions at the flap stalk. The associated veins are also removed. The vascular pedicle is then removed. All arteries and veins are supplied using 4/0 Prolene puncture ligatures. Flap is rinsed with heparin and preserved. The thigh wound is closed in layers after careful hemostasis and insertion of a Redon drain. The flap is then inserted into the defect and sutured into the defect without tension after the sutures have been placed. An approx. 5 cm wide, de-epithelialized bridge to a skin monitor was created in the caudal area. The defect was closed completely and with minimal tension. The vessels are connected after trimming and conditioning of the vessels. An end-to-end anastomosis is made between the superior thyroid artery, which was preserved during the radical neck dissection, and the descending ramus with 8/0 ethilon sutures. This is followed by the anastomosis between the main venous drainage vessel and the external jugular vein, which was also preserved during the neck dissection. A size 3/5 coupler is used for this. After arterial anastomosis good venous return via the vein, after venous anastomosis good venous return. Flap vital. This is followed by careful hemostasis. Overall, hemostasis is sometimes very difficult during the operation as there is constant and diffuse bleeding from the various tissue sections due to coagulation disorders. Skin closure of the neck wound on the right is achieved without any problems by inserting a Redon drain. Skin closure of the wound on the left with insertion of the skin monitor. However, due to the increased tissue tension in the middle area, a small portion of the skin remains unsutured to prevent compression of the flap. A flap was inserted on the left. The laryngectomy tube is replaced by a tracheostomy tube with a core, which is fixed with sutures. The procedure is completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Overall, due to continuous bleeding with impaired coagulation, need for blood reserves and coagulation factors. At the end of the operation, the jugular vein was easy to check with the Doppler at the marked site. The skin monitor was vital. Postoperatively, please continue antibiotics with Unacid i.v.. Feeding via the previously inserted PEG tube. Food build-up after swallowing porridge on the 10th day with unremarkable findings. The still dehisced wound area on the left cervical side can be closed secondarily after the swelling has subsided. Please carry out regular Doppler checks of the monitor postoperatively according to the scheme. Postoperative radio-chemotherapy is certainly necessary for mulicentric hypopharyngeal carcinoma and field cancerization.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheostomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (ALT)

Intubation of the patient. The supraglottis is adjusted with the small bore tube. A penetrating defect can be seen at the base of the epiglottis, at the transition to the vallecula. The entire inner surface of the epiglottis is affected by an exophytic tumor, which here occupies the right side somewhat preferentially, but clearly crosses the midline. The support autoscopy is removed and the patient is switched to a spreading laryngoscope. This allows the tumor to be exposed reasonably well. Circular resection is now performed with the CO2 laser. Due to the slightly restricted view, the position of the spreading laryngoscope has to be changed once during the operation. The resection extends over the aryepiglottic fold on the right side into the vallecula and the prelaryngeal fat on both sides. The arytenoid cartilage on the right side is skeletonized on the inside. On the left side, the ary remains completely covered by mucosa and untouched. Due to an infestation of the detachment margin on the right ary, which could not be ruled out, a subsequent resection had to be performed during the operation, which was also sent in for final histological findings, as was the main specimen. Macroscopically, all the margins of the deposit appear free. The caudal margin refers to the pocket fold on the left side across the commissure to the pocket fold on the right side. However, 95% of the pocket folds are preserved. Removal of sedimentation margin samples in the caudal sedimentation area and anteriorly to the pre-epiglottic fat. All the specimens taken from the edge of the sedimentation area are sent for frozen section diagnostics. Here, the intraoperative findings are that there is high-grade dysplasia in the settling margin of the pocket fold on the right side and in the area of the commissure of the pocket folds, which is why the pathologists would recommend a resection here. This is done without any problems after the spreading laryngoscope has been inserted again with the CO2 laser. The new samples taken from the margins are sent for final histopathological diagnosis. If the wound is dry, removal of the spreading laryngoscope and support autoscopy. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection. First injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline. Then skin incision, initially on the right side on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The dissection is performed subcutaneously far ventrally after an atheroma-like change becomes apparent here. This atheroma is removed from the subcutaneous tissue from the inside. A tiny skin injury is primarily treated with a suture. Subsequent layer-by-layer dissection in depth. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the posterior belly of the digaster muscle. Exposure of the glandular capsule of the submandibular gland. Subsequently, the examination reveals a lymph node conglomerate far caudally and one in the area of the venous angle. Both lymph node conglomerates are dissected laterally down from the cervical vascular sheath after it has been exposed. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath involves sparing the vagus nerve and all vascular structures. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the vagus nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. After the lymph node conglomerates have been dissected laterally from the vein, the lateral neck preparation with all easily palpable nodes is removed. This is done while sparing the accessorius nerve. The hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve are lifted out of their bed in the sense of a neurolysis and re-embedded after relocation. The accessorius triangle is also removed. Clearing of the hypoglossal triangle and development of the anterior neck preparation. All branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery are also protected. The preparation is sent together for diagnosis. Two-layer wound closure. Insertion of a Redon drainage. Application of a pressure dressing. Repositioning for neck dissection on the left side. This shows a cN0 neck status. Skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of all landmarks with the omohyoid muscle, the digaster muscle and the submandibular gland. Exposure and opening of the cervical vascular sheath. Long-distance dissection of the vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. All nerves are lifted out of their bed in the sense of a neurolysis and re-embedded. Release of the accessorius triangle and development of the entire lateral neck preaprate. The hypoglossal triangle is also released and then the entire anterior neck preparation is developed. Here too, the dissection is performed while sparing all branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery. There are no enlarged lymph nodes. The entire preparation is also sent for histopathological examination. Insertion of a Redon drainage. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure dressing. The result is a selective neck dissection of five levels on both sides. Due to the extent of the endolaryngeal resection and the potential swallowing problems to be expected, the decision was made to tracheotomize the patient. This is also performed after injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline pretracheally. Transverse skin incision and layer-by-layer preparation in depth. Exposure of the prelaryngeal and infralaryngeal muscles. This is separated in the middle. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is clamped on both sides, severed and ligated. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. The trachea is then opened between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp. Dissection of the Björ flap. Then circular suturing of the tracheostoma with several holding sutures. Insertion of a tracheostomy tube. Final consultation with the anesthetist.","Laser resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy

After external pre-diagnosis in our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was recommended.","First inspection of the primary tumor region. This revealed a partially ulcerated process of the right edge of the tongue, measuring approx. 2 x 4 cm in total with infiltration of a good 1-1.5 cm in depth; the lateral and posterior floor of the mouth was largely free and regular. There is also no infiltration of the glossotonsillar groove. Good exposure possibility. The tongue is now snared transorally. Incision of the tumor with a safety margin of a good 1 cm, also in the depth of a soft tissue mantle of 1 cm on all sides. Ligation of an arterial and a venous side branch and removal of the tumor macroscopically on all sides in sano, which is thread-marked on all sides for frozen section diagnostics. Here, all margins including the basal margin are diagnosed as tumor- and dysplasia-free, hence a clear R0 situation. Later, after final inspection and wound irrigation, the adapting mucosa is used to compress the wound surface. The lateral floor of the mouth is easily displaceable and there is no penetrating defect, so there is no indication for reconstruction here. Turn to the right side first for neck dissection. Skin incision made at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma, exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the facial vein, the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve and the cervical nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle, free preparation of the internal jugular vein with exposure of the external and internal carotid artery, which shows a clear kinking with a lateral course. Exposure of the vagus nerve, clearing of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Finally, evacuation of level Ib. Dislocation of the submandibular gland, evacuation of the level with careful protection of the ramus marginalis mandibulae. Final wound inspection and wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Turn to the opposite side. In principle, the same procedure is used here. After exposing and preserving the external jugular vein and auricular nerve, expose the limited musculature. Then remove the anterior neck preparation and preserve the V. facialis, A. thyroidea superior, N. hypoglossus. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, here the vascular tissue is left in place and level IIb is therefore only partially cleared out. Careful dissection of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the vagus nerve and the course of the internal carotid artery exactly as described on the opposite side. Clear kinking here too. Deposition of the specimen at the transition to level Va with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Here too, final wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drainage and careful two-layer wound closure.

Subsequent entry with rigid endoscopy. Inspection of the subglottic slope and trachea. Unobtrusive conditions. Now nasal intubation. Subsequent inspection of the oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx, also under the microscope. The previously described tumor of the right tonsil is seen, which ends at the lower tonsil pole, but extends palpatorily, as already recognized on CT, far to the submucosal cranial side and infiltrates here into the palate on the right side, but does not cross the midline here. Subsequent flexible esophagoscopy. Unobtrusive conditions as far as the stomach. After performing the diaphanoscopy and insertion of the troicart, the PEG is inserted in the typical manner using the thread pull-through method. The tumor is then positioned with the tonsil retractor and cut around with the electric needle. Dissection from cranial to caudal, cutting around the tumor with a large safety margin. Laterally, the tumor does not appear to be growing beyond the capsule of the tonsil, so that the tumor can be removed in toto from the pharyngeal wall with the raspatory without difficulty. Removal of the tumor caudally. Subsequent formation of a resectate in the cranial part, which is also sent for final histology. Finally, the edge samples are taken. These are found to be tumor-free. Now turn to the neck dissection on the left side: To do this, make a skin incision in the typical manner along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Expose the same. Dissection of the neck sheath. Exposure of the accessory nerve, vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Dissection of the lateral neck preparation from the digaster to the omohyoid, sparing the above-mentioned structures and the main plexus branches. Careful hemostasis. Evacuation of the medial neck preparation, taking the capsule of the submandibular gland with it and again careful hemostasis, H2O2 irrigation and insertion of a Redon drain. Finally, two-layer wound closure. Now neck dissection on the right side: identical procedure here. Also dissection from the digaster to the omohyoid. Expose the cervical vascular sheath, the vagus nerve, the accessorius nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. Clearing out the lateral neck preparation while protecting the structures and the plexus branches. Careful hemostasis. Dissection along the capsule of the submandibular gland in a medial direction and removal of the medial neck preparation. Subsequent careful hemostasis. H2O2 irrigation. Finally, this wound is left open and the vascular trunk of the superior thyroid is explored. This can be seen at the level of the bulb, leaving the externa and sufficiently wide and pulsating well; the internal jugular vein is also visualized. Insertion of H2O2 swabs and turning to the tracheotomy: For this purpose, skin incision with dissection through the subcutis and pushing apart the prelaryngeal muscles. Undermining of the thyroid gland. Insertion of clamps. Cutting of the same in the midline. Subsequent repositioning. After locating the anterior wall of the trachea, the incision is made between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Form a Björk flap in the typical manner and skin adaptation to the trachea to form an epithelialized stoma. Now reintubation with an 8-gauge Rügheimer cannula. Then lift the radial flap. To do this, cut around the skin preparation. Remove the fascia from the musculature. Locate the radial artery. Then follow it into the crook of the elbow and release it from its bed. The radial artery is deposited in the antecubital fossa before the interosseous artery leaves. The accompanying veins are placed in a confluence. Careful hemostasis is then performed. Heparin irrigation. Attachment of the perfusor. Due to ABC intolerance, full heparinization is performed here. Now lift the split skin from the groin. This defect is sutured primarily after careful hemostasis and insertion of a Redon drainage. Split skin coverage of the forearm. The skin is then sutured down to the crook of the elbow. Application of a forearm splint. Fitting of the skin preparation into the defect. Reconstruct the palatal arch and, after undermining, pull the flap pedicle through towards the neck. Anastomize the radial artery with the superior thyroid artery microscopically. Then end-to-end, then end-to-side anastomosis of the accompanying veins in their confluence with the jugular artery. After careful hemostasis and checking for good flow, H2O2 irrigation is performed again and the wound is closed in two layers. Check the wound again at the end of the procedure. No evidence of bleeding. Flap vital.","Tumor resection of right tonsil, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy, PEG placement, Panendoscopy

Sonographically, no space-occupying lesion could be visualized on the floor of the mouth with a cN0 neck status; in addition, a primarily non-suspicious mass of the thyroid gland on the right side measuring 24 x 16 x 24 mm was found sonographically. Therefore, indication to perform a panendoscopy with excision of the histologically confirmed malignant mass on the underside of the tongue. However, after consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, a coarse needle biopsy of the right-sided thyroid nodule was initially not performed during the operation as the patient's malignant disease should be treated first.","After problem-free induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues, a rigid tracheoscopy is performed first. For this purpose, an O° scope was inserted and the trachea inspected, which was free, non-irritated and clearly visible up to the carina. Finally, withdrawal of the rigid endoscope if there is no evidence of an exophytically growing mass. Removal of the endoscope and intubation by the surgeon. The patient's head is then placed in a low position and a flexible esophagogastroscopy is performed. For this, a flexible endoscope is inserted into the stomach under visualization. A regular mucosal relief can be seen in the stomach. The endoscope is advanced as far as the pylorus, where conditions are also unremarkable. Then carefully withdraw the flexible endoscope and inspect the esophago-gastric junction. Discrete signs of chronic reflux esophagitis. However, no evidence of an exophytic or ulcerating mass. Then careful withdrawal of the flexible endoscope and inspection of the esophagus, here as far as possible inconspicuous mucosal conditions. Then remove the flexible endoscope, insert a mouth guard and perform a pharyngo- and laryngoscopy. For this purpose, a Kleinsasser C-tube is inserted and the oral cavity region, the floor of the mouth and the upper pharyngeal sections are inspected. A slightly spherical and broad-based, rough mass approx. 1 x 1 cm on the median underside of the tongue sitting directly on the frenulum lingulae, which also shows a cone-shaped extension towards the carunculae. The rest of the floor of the mouth as well as the tongue, oral vestibule, tonsillar lobes, palatal arches and uvula are intact and without irritation. The deeper pharynx with the posterior pharyngeal wall region, the piriform sinus entrances and hypopharyngeal walls on both sides are also unremarkable and without irritation. The arytenoid region, aryepiglottic fold and epiglottis are also non-irritant and inconspicuous. The glottis itself is also non-irritating and inconspicuous. Then removal of the Kleinsasser C-tube and the mouth guard and finally turning to the tumorous mass. First demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First, an anterior duct incision of the wharton's duct is performed on both sides after the tumor reaches the caruculae with an extension. The duct is slit on both sides without any problems. The slit duct section is marsupialized. The mass is then successively removed in toto with the scissors with a sufficiently wide safety margin and bipolar coagulation of the feeding vessels. The marsupialized duct tissue is spared. The preparation is then thread-marked for final histology. Extensive hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation with absolutely dry wound conditions, then termination of the procedure with repositioning of the patient's head. Summarizing remarks: During the operation, a panendoscopy was performed with unremarkable findings and an excision in toto of the already confirmed squamous cell carcinoma on the underside of the tongue. In addition, an anterior duct incision of the wharton's duct was performed on both sides. The patient was advised to undergo intensive gland massage postoperatively.

This reveals extensive tumor growth, starting at the posterior pharyngeal wall, at the level of the epiglottis, occupying the entire postcricoid, but leaving the arytenoid humps exposed for more than 1 cm each. The tumor extends through both piriform recesses to the esophageal entrance. Due to the fact that the larynx is not completely covered and the medial piriform recess is not reached by the tumor on either side, the decision is made to preserve the larynx and to perform a complete pharyngectomy in the sense of tumor resection via lateral pharyngotomy from the right. A Gluck-Soerensen incision is now made and the right cervical vascular nerve sheath is dissected. Due to the previous operations and the radiotherapy, a correspondingly scarred picture is seen. Nevertheless, the internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery, bulb, external and internal arteries can be fully visualized. The external artery still shows the superior thyroid artery and the maxillary lingual and facial arteries as outlets. The hypoglossal nerve is also exposed and spared. The hyoid bone is now further dissected and half the hyoid bone is removed for further resection and treatment. Half of the thyroid cartilage is also skeletonized on the right side and the hypopharynx is released. Strict care is taken to ensure that no lesions occur, particularly in the area of the anterior thyroid cartilage. However, as already mentioned, the right thyroid cartilage is removed for further resection of the tumor while preserving the bow. This is followed by a pharyngotomy from the right above the hyoid bone and exposure of the underlying tumor. Complete bypass of the tumor in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall and complete pharyngectomy in the sense of a circular pharyngeal resection, leaving postcricoid mucosa of approx. 1 cm below the arytenoid cartilage. The remaining tissue is now completely removed and traced down to the esophageal entrance. Approx. 2 cm of the esophageal entrance is also resected due to the tumor growth ending 1 cm above it. The esophagus is fixed with sutures to enable later reanastomization and reconstruction with the flap graft. Quick incisions are taken, which are finally reported as tumor-free. Furthermore, the radialis graft to be lifted is now measured for reconstruction. The result is a modified trapezoidal graft measuring 11 by 8 cm and 6 cm in length. This is then incorporated circularly in the form of a funnel. A small, so-called flap key is formed in the area of the esophagus to prevent subsequent re-stenosis in this area. The graft on the left forearm is now lifted in a bloodless state in the typical manner. Once the graft has been removed and the bleeding has been stopped, it is gradually incorporated, first in the area of the esophageal entrance and then in the hypo-/oropharyngeal area. This ensures good and complete wound closure. In order to mobilize the larynx slightly cranially towards the base of the tongue, the cricoid cartilage is now grasped submucosally with a 0 suture and sutured to the base of the tongue, taking the remaining hyoid bone with it. This results in a clearly visible cranial displacement of the larynx, which should enable the patient to swallow more easily. After closure, the anastomosis is performed accordingly. This involves an end-to-end anastomosis of the lingual artery with the radial artery using single button sutures and an end-to-side anastomosis using a 3.5 mm vascular couplas. Finally, good vascular flow is established and the skin and subcutaneous sutures are applied. As part of the skin suture, the skin monitor of the flap is also integrated into the neck wound. Finally, the Doppler signals are checked, which are documented and are good. Parallel to the incorporation of the flap, <CLINICIAN_NAME> lifts the full-thickness skin in the area of the right groin and incorporates it in the area of the left forearm to cover the lifting defect. A vacuum seal is now applied and activated. Application of a Cramer splint to immobilize the forearm and hand. Finally, reintubation to a Rüsch cannula and suturing of the cannula","Pharyngectomy, Reconstruction, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy, Diagnostic MLE (Microlaryngoscopy and Endoscopy)

Easy pre-scopy into the stomach. Here, with excellent diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. The oesophagus is inconspicuous on reflection. Repositioning of the patient for transoral tumor resection. Insertion of the open mouth blocker. Re-inspection: The exophytic tumor process can be seen in the area of the underside of the tongue on the left side. The anterior floor of the mouth is not reached. Small leukoplakic extensions in the surrounding area, but with a relatively well-defined tumor process. Incision around the tumor with a safety margin of 1 cm. Depth infiltration approx. 0.5 cm. Involvement of the tongue muscles. The excretory duct can remain intact. The resectate is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics and is diagnosed as completely tumor-free in the area of the margins. Careful hemostasis. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. Submandibular skin incision and start with the left side. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation and dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the digastric muscle does not reveal a truly pronounced submandibular gland. Therefore, elevation of the ramus marginalis mandibulae and clearing of level Ib. The anterior margin shows a clearly suspicious lesion without surrounding infiltration. Removal of level Ib. Exposure of the anterior venter of the digastric muscle. Complete evacuation of level Ia via the left side. Complete the neck dissection, exposing and preserving the facial vein, the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the accessory nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle. Here there are conspicuous changes in both Level IIa and Level IIb, especially in Level IIa clinically metastatic lesions. Clearing of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Clearing up to the transition to level Vb. No evidence of lymphatic leakage caudally. Careful exposure of the internal jugular vein, common carotid artery and vagus nerve. Final wound inspection, wound irrigation. Turn to the opposite side. After exposing the muscular borders, the submandibular gland is regularly exposed. Evacuation of level Ib with careful protection of the ramus marginalis mandibulae. Then complete to level Ia. Clearing of levels IIa to IV with careful preservation of the facial vein, the superior thyroid artery and the cervical sinus. Exposure and preservation of the accessorius nerve. Limitation of the extension towards level V. No further measures and no suspicious nodes. Careful wound irrigation. If the wound is dry, final inspection of the wound cavities. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Final enoral inspection and, if the wound is dry, completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT2 cN2b oral cavity carcinoma in the area of the underside of the tongue on the left.

First, pharyngoscopy again: Relatively flat, exophytic tumor is seen in the area of the left uvula, growing towards the anterior and posterior palatal arch, but overall rather superficial growth. Now transoral resection: tumor is removed macroscopically on all sides in healthy tissue with a safety margin of 1 cm. The entire tonsil is resected caudally. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section. Here all margins in healthy tissue. Overall, the findings are now borderline with regard to defect coverage using a radial flap. Anterior and posterior palatal arch partially preserved. Due to this borderline function, decision to refrain from flap coverage for the time being. Wait and see whether regurgitation or dysphagia develops. In any case, neck dissection at intervals of one to two weeks, then with flap coverage if necessary. Finally, careful hemostasis again.

Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. First of all, insertion with the small water tube and adjustment of the tumor region. The tumor is extremely difficult to position with the small water tube, making laser resection impossible. In addition, the tumor covers large parts of the right base of the tongue and extends laterally to the metastasis coming from the neck, so that laser resection is not recommended for this reason either. In addition, this would result in a very large defect that would be worth covering anyway. Entering with the flexible gastroesophagoscope and pre-scanning into the stomach. Insertion of a PEG using the thread pull-through method. This is successful with good diaphanoscopy. Application of a wound dressing. Start with neck dissection on the right side. The tumor is marked transorally beforehand. Large lymph node conglomerates with infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle can be seen. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is therefore initially removed caudally. Lymph node conglomerates can be dissected from the omohyoid muscle. Dissection of the larynx. First expose the medial digastric muscle or the hypoglossal nerve. Laborious dissection of the lymph nodes from the structures that can initially be preserved. Then dissection of the tendon of the digastric muscle. Then dissection from the dorsal side. Co-resection of the lower parotid pole and removal of the sternocleidomastoid muscle cranially. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath from the caudal side. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, common carotid artery, later the internal and external carotid artery. The internal jugular vein is infiltrated from the middle and is initially set off caudally and ligated twice. Further dissection cranially along the carotid artery. The internal and external carotid arteries can be dissected, but parts of the branches of the external carotid artery are infiltrated. The superior thyroid artery and lingual artery can be preserved. The facial and superficial temporal arteries must also be removed in the other small branches. The hypoglossal nerve is now massively infiltrated, the nerve is distended. Macroscopically clear infiltration. Separation of the nerve. Further dissection along the internal carotid artery. Here the tumor can be laboriously dissected from the internal carotid artery, as well as from the vagus nerve. Inclusion of the stylohyoid muscle. Cranial separation of the internal jugular vein. However, this is hardened from the wall near the base of the skull, here a marginal sample. Subsequently, further removal of the lymph nodes between the branches of the cervical plexus from level V a and b. Multiple lymph nodes are positive here. Branches of the cervical plexus can be partially preserved, the cranial accessorius nerve must also be severed and removed. Finally, the massive lymph node conglomerate and multiple affected lymph nodes can be removed. Level II to V removal. Soft tissue is removed cranially from the area of the internal carotid artery up to the bifurcation. This soft tissue is carcinoma-positive, as is the marginal sample of the internal jugular vein, which was removed close to the base of the skull. Thus an overall R1 to R2 situation. No further measures due to the involvement of vital structures. Snaring of the superior thyroid artery, the lingual artery and the internal carotid artery. Exposure of the pharyngeal wall. Tumor resection: Exposure of the upper edge of the tumor from the inside. Dissection through the pharyngeal wall under control from the inside and outside. Exposure of the tumor and successive removal of the tumor with a safety margin of 1 to 1.5 cm on all sides, also macroscopically towards the depth. Parts of the pharyngeal wall from the tonsillar lobe and parts of the glossoalveolar junction are removed. Parts of the vallecula are removed caudally, the base of the tongue is largely removed in the caudal and middle section, with the resection extending to just above or partly above the midline. The tumor is removed in its entirety and marked with sutures. As a hardened nodule was noticed cranially when the tumor was removed, which may also have corresponded to the tonsil, a marginal sample is taken from the pharyngeal wall area with remaining parts of the tonsil. In the frozen section, this tumor margin specimen as well as the specimen in the healthy state, relatively scarce in the basal region due to tissue shrinkage, but to be classified as R0 during resection. Neck dissection on the left side. For this purpose, an apron flap is created in the usual manner. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the digastric and omohyoid muscles. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the facial vein. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Clearing of the neck levels II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. Several rough, spherical lymph node metastases are clearly visible here, all of which are also removed. After the neck dissection on the left, the tracheotomy is performed. The incision is made at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage. Dissection down to the thyroid isthmus, which is cut through. Thorough bipolar coagulation. Opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis and reintubation. Elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap boundaries (size) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the pronator quadratus and flexor pollicis longus muscles with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vascular clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Deposition of the radialis graft and preparation of the vascular situation in the elbow. Lifting of split skin on the right thigh. Application of Starsil wound powder and application of a foam dressing. Preparation of the wound bed on the left forearm. For this purpose, the superficial ramus of the radial nerve is embedded laterally into the tissue so that it cannot come into contact with the split skin and is protected. Partial adaptation and reduction of the wound area and suturing of muscles to tendons that are particularly exposed. Fitting of the split-thickness skin graft and suturing of the split-thickness skin graft in the usual manner. At the end, the application of ball swabs to areas where the split skin had no contact with the subsurface. Application and suturing of compresses and application of a dorsal forearm splint. Insertion of the graft, initially transorally. Here the defect extends up to the soft palate and into the tonsillar lumen. The tonsil is also removed. The remaining graft must be sutured in from the transcervical side. Due to the ultimately even larger defect than planned, the pharynx must be partially gathered. However, this is not a problem, so that the graft fits well in the end. The stalk is transferred to the left side; there is no longer a connecting vessel on the right side due to the radical neck dissection. The superior thyroid artery is used on the left side. This is particularly difficult as all other vessels in the neck are very small in caliber, but the radial artery is very large. Therefore, the caliber jump must be specially bridged using suture techniques. The venous anastomosis is performed on the facial vein and the external jugular vein. The flap pedicle has very good pulsation at the end and the flap is well supplied with blood. Insertion of two Redon drains. Application of a pressure dressing on both sides. The patient goes to the intensive care unit intubated and ventilated through the tracheostoma with a size 8.0 tracheostomy tube. Final consultation with the anesthesia department. Please continue postoperative antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Flap checks according to the usual schedule.","Combined transoral-transcervical tumor resection, Radical bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Submucosally, the tumor reaches the uvula on palpation and thus the median line of the soft palate. However, it can be differentiated from the hard palate. Furthermore, the tumor extends over the lateral pharyngeal wall, the angle of the jaw, straight onto the base of the tongue and ends caudally just above the lateral wall of the piriform recess. The tumor is now cut around from the enoral side with the monopolar and the scissor blade with an appropriate safety distance of approx. 1 cm. After in toto resection, the specimen is thread-marked and sent for histopathological frozen section evaluation. This reveals an R1 situation caudally in the area of the glossotonsillar groove, so that a resection and a further final marginal sample are sent for frozen section diagnosis. This is now tumor-free. The neck is first dissected, initially on the right side: a skin incision is made along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Dissection of the platysma and creation of a cranial platysmal flap. The external jugular vein and the auricular nerve are spared. Dissection of the vascular nerve sheath while sparing the vascular nerve structures. Dissection along the omohyoid muscle to the hyoid bone and along the digastric muscle to the laterobase. All vascular nerve structures can be preserved on the right side and levels II, III, IV and Va are removed. A lateral pharyngotomy is then performed to insert the pedicle, taking the posterior digastric venter muscle with it to prevent narrowing of the pedicle. The facial vein and the lingual vein also cross the pedicle passage so that they are ligated and cut. A lumen 2 to 3 transverse fingers in size is now created to allow the stem to pass through easily and without pressure. This is followed by the neck dissection on the left side: for this purpose, a skin incision is also made along the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the case of two previous left cervical operations. Here, the vascular nerve sheath is dissected and the vascular nerve structures are preserved in difficult, scarred conditions. Dissection along the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid bone and along the digastric muscle up to the laterobasis. Completion and elevation of the level II and III neck block without conspicuous lymph node pathology macroscopically. Furthermore, clearing of level Va. Macroscopically, there are no abnormal lymph nodes on the left side. However, the assessment is limited due to the scarring situation in the case of previous surgery. Parallel to the neck dissection, elevation of the radialis graft from the left forearm in tourniquet (300 mm/Hg). After measuring the graft to be lifted and marking the intended structure of the defect coverage, the lift is performed in the typical manner using a skin monitor. Skin flaps are created and subfascial preparation is made on the brachioradialis muscle. The cephalic vein is included in the elevation in order to integrate the superficial venous system into the venous drainage. Dissection distally and after using the Hayden maneuver, identification of the radial superficial ramus nerve. Protection of the nerve. Locate the vascular pedicle, cut it and further dissect the ulna. Here, too, subfascial dissection with protection of a peritendineum. Lifting now from distal to proximal into the crook of the elbow. There is no transition from the deep to the superficial venous system in the sense of a venous bridge, so that a deep vein is provided in the antecubital fossa as a connecting vein after the venae comitantes have been brought together. The cephalic vein, on the other hand, is ligated accordingly. Separation of the radial artery above the interosseous artery. The ulnar artery is clearly identified beforehand. After initial vascularization due to cold in the area of the flap, with good blood supply to the forearm and hand, after opening the tourniquet, the blood supply to the graft is regular after appropriate warming. For this reason, the graft is not lifted for half an hour to allow it to recover. This takes place completely. After careful hemostasis of minor bleeding in the area of the graft, the graft is now set down accordingly and inserted from the outside to the inside into the enoral defect for reconstruction of the soft palate and the lateral pharyngeal wall. Parts of the tongue body are sutured primarily. Incorporation leads to a successful reconstruction of the structures to be treated, followed by microvascular anastomoses. For this purpose, the superior thyroid artery is anastomosed end-to-end with the flap artery using 8/0 nylon sutures. The vein is anastomized end-to-end using a 2.5 mm vascular coupler. If the vascular flow is regular and the flap is well perfused, a fat seal is inserted into the pedicle curvature in addition to the skin monitor for better pedicle positioning. Subcutaneous sutures and skin suture on the right cervical side with insertion of a flap. On the left cervical side, the skin suture is performed in the classic sense in the form of a subcutaneous and single-button skin suture and insertion of a Redon drain. Meanwhile, the forearm is partially closed primarily and covered in the area of the lifting defect with full-thickness skin from the right groin, which was previously removed, and covered with a vacuum dressing, which should remain in place for 7 days. Application of a Cramer splint. Repositioning of the hand and forearm. Finally, creation of a tracheostoma. For this, a typical jugular skin incision is made and, after subcutaneous preparation and lateral displacement of the infrahyoid muscles, the thyroid isthmus is cut. Dissection of the anterior surface of the trachea. Creation of a caudally pedicled stoma and suturing of the stoma edge to the skin. Transfer intubation to a blockable Lanz cannula and suture the cannula. The cannula must remain in place for 5 days and any bandages and pressure in the neck area should also be avoided. The vessels are monitored by vascular Doppler examination and inspection of the skin monitor every hour for the first 72 hours and every 4 hours for a further 48 hours. If problems arise, the surgeon can be informed by telephone at any time. The patient is intubated and ventilated overnight for monitoring in the intensive care unit.

The panendoscopy initially performed showed a clear support for a primary tumor. In addition to the extensive cervical lymph node metastasis, the PET-CT showed a primary, suspicious lesion in the left hypopharyngeal region, as well as an inflammatory process in the lung, but no evidence of distant metastases. Preoperatively, our pulmonology department was able to rule out active TB. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference and in a detailed discussion with the patient and relatives, the primary surgical treatment was decided. Depending on the local extent of the tumor, this may even include a laryngectomy as a last resort.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, a new pharyngo-laryngoscopy is performed to search for the primary ear again. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube under dental protection and inspection of the inconspicuous oral vestibule. Inspection of the oral cavity, which, including the floor of the mouth, tongue and soft palate, is free on inspection and palpation. Inconspicuous oropharynx on the right side. The entire hypopharynx up to the entrance to the esophagus is also clear, inconspicuous endolarynx. In the area of the left piriform sinus, an exophytic, papillomatous tumor is now visible, which grows like a lawn in the piriform sinus and almost completely fills the piriform sinus from the lateral wall to the medial side. The esophageal entrance is certainly free. It can be seen that the tumor extends laterally to the left arytenoid via the medial piriform sinus wall, as well as to the postcricoid region, but here it is superficial on all sides, with no evidence of deep infiltration. Multiple deep biopsies were taken to confirm the diagnosis. The frozen section diagnosis now shows an invasive squamous cell carcinoma matching the already confirmed lymph node metastasis. Overall, however, the flat tumor is cT3 due to its size of over 4 cm. After hemostasis using suprarenal intubation, a PEG tube was inserted. For this, insertion with the gastroscope. Under laryngoscopic control, easy advancement into the stomach. Now, with good diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. The esophagus is inconspicuous on reflection. The patient was then repositioned and prepared for neck dissection on the left. Here a barely displaceable mass approx. 7 x 5 cm is seen, which sonographically is also clearly at least adjacent to the carotid artery. Palpation revealed clear infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Make a curved skin incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, taking the scar of the trial excision with it. Spindle-shaped excision of the scar. By excising the scar, the tumorous mass can be accessed directly. This is clearly a soft tissue metastasis without only a capsular structure, therefore extensive excision of the scar. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and exposure of the digastric muscle. This can just be separated from the soft tissue metastasis. Gross infiltration of the surrounding tissue. Therefore caudal separation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, also safe infiltration of the accessorius nerve. Partial approach of the metastasis to the omohyoid muscle, which is also taken along. Detachment of the thyroid gland, which is not infiltrated. Now visualization of the internal jugular vein, which is thrombosed here and clearly infiltrated caudally. Caudal visualization of the internal jugular vein, also showing clear signs of thrombosis and a very slender vessel. Visualization of the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Separation of the internal jugular vein, caudal and cranial after ligation and repositioning. Exposure and release of the submandibular gland, which is exposed. Anterior exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, which is also free here, overall difficult preparation conditions. Difficult resection conditions due to the partly diffusely growing soft tissue metastasis. Now dissect the common carotid artery, which is free. Exposure of the bulb, exposure of the exit of the internal and external carotid artery. After the exit of the external carotid artery, infiltration of the superior thyroid artery is seen. Later there is also infiltration of the lingual artery. Further dissection and retrograde tracing of the hypoglossal nerve also revealed a clear infiltration of the hypoglossal nerve. This is therefore also resected. Cranially, the external carotid artery is also thickened, so that the external carotid artery is resected approx. 2 cm from the exit after puncture and multiple ligation if its exit is safely infiltrated. Now good isolation of the internal carotid artery, which can be easily released after careful dissection, no infiltration here, so that macroscopic in sano resection is performed after removal of the metastasis from level 5 with partial infiltration of the cervical plexus and the surrounding musculature. When the right side wall of the pharynx is removed, a spontaneous perforation occurs in the direction of the pharynx with direct contact to the primaries, so it can be assumed that the metastasis is growing per continuitatem. Finally, clearing of levels Va and Vb. Ligation of the caudal level Vb without evidence of lymph flow. The jugular vein had already been removed previously, but its drainage area was preserved. Now turn to tumor resection. First, after dissection of the paralaryngeal muscles, expose the thyroid cartilage horn, push off the perichondrium, remove the lateral thyroid cartilage, carefully detach the hypoharyngeal mucosa. Now enter above the spontaneous pharyngeal opening, widen the pharyngotomy. Now a good overview. As described above, the tumor appears like a turf and very superficial in the extensions. Macroscopically inconspicuous. Therefore, first resection of the macroscopically altered tissue. The resection extends over the entire piriform sinus up to the arytenoid as well as approx. 1/3 of the postcricoid region. Starting from the left arytenoid, it can be seen that a tumor turf also extends to the aryepiglottic fold and reaches up to the edge of the pharyngoepiglottic fold, completely detaching the altered area. Due to the already spontaneous perforation of the tumor, the tumor was resected in parts, certainly no deep infiltration. Completely covering the tumor, the removal of completely imaging margin samples is now carried out. In the area of the medial piriform sinus wall, there is still margin-forming CIS with otherwise in sano resection of the invasive carcinoma. Therefore, a resection is performed first and then a final margin sample is taken, which shows moderate dysplasia in the frozen section diagnosis without evidence of CIS or invasive carcinoma. Therefore, an R0 resection can be assumed here. This results in a defect that includes the entire piriform sinus, including the medial wall up to the postcricoid region. The endolarynx and the arytenoid joint itself were not altered. In addition, the left aryepiglottic fold was resected as well as the lateral edge of the epiglottis up to the vallecula. A total defect measuring approx. 10 x 5 cm is now measured, readaptation of previously released postcricoid mucosa. Due to the defect and the extensive cervical metastasis, there is now an indication for defect reconstruction. Therefore, the tracheotomy, right-sided neck dissection and ALT graft harvesting from the right thigh are now performed in parallel. First the tracheotomy. To do this, make a skin incision approx. 1 cm below the cricoid cartilage, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose and ligate both anterior jugular veins, expose the infrahyoid muscles, enter the linea alba. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Identification and clamping of the thyroid isthmus. Transection and puncture ligation. After exposing the anterior surface of the trachea, insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring: creation of a broad-based Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma. Subsequent intubation, initially onto a Woodbridge tube, later onto an 8 mm Rügheimer cannula, which is suture-fixed. Now for neck dissection of the right side of the neck. To do this, make a curved skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland, exposure of the accessorius nerve and free dissection of the internal jugular vein with careful protection and the strong anterior branches of the veins, which end in a type of facial venous plexus. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve, cervical artery and superior thyroid artery. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level 5 with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Subsequent vessel preparation. An antero-lateral transfemoral graft is then harvested from the right side; after marking the landmarks, two strong main perforators and a secondary perforator are identified by Doppler sonography. Removal of a 16 x 5 cm graft to obtain a skin monitor. Initial medial skin incision, cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose and secure the rectus femoris muscle. Strictly subfascial preparation, identification of the ramus descendens, the lateral circumflex artery. After visualization of the anatomy, it is now apparent that the ramus descendens provides an intramuscular perforator and the ramus obliquus a fasciocutaneous perforator. Careful dissection of both pedicle vessels. Despite dissection up to the groin, there is no common arterial confluence. Therefore, initially leave both vessel preparations and primarily the ramus descendens completely cut around the graft, distal ligation of the vascular pedicle. Inclusion of the fascia lata, caudal fasciocutaneous elevation of the graft in the area of the caudal perforator. Inclusion of a muscle cuff to protect the perforators. Cranial fasciocutaneous elevation again. A regular flap vitality can be seen on all sides. Now, with a long but slender vessel of the descending branch, the cranial perforator is clamped off, and even after waiting there is no change in perfusion and therefore restriction to the caudal main perforator. Dissection of the long artery and the vein after confluence and removal of the graft with normal vitality. Careful wound inspection and, if conditions are dry, insertion of a Redon drain and careful and strong two-layer wound closure. The graft is now inserted and a patch measuring approx. 10 x 5 cm is inserted into the pharyngeal defect. Overall good fit. Deepithelialization of the remaining graft, leaving an area of skin measuring approx. 3 x 3 cm in the tip of the flap. This is later sutured into the cervical skin for monitoring. After complete and sufficient suturing, there is now no possibility of left-sided anastomosis due to the narrow vessels, therefore prelaryngeal tunneling, creation of a wide tunnel of approx. 6 cm. After fixation of the fascia lata and the muscle cuff, the vessels are moved to the right side of the neck under tension-free conditions. Good positioning here. Conditioning of the flap vessels, conditioning of the superior thyroid artery, placement of the superior thyroid artery after clipping of the part. Good flow conditions here and subsequent performance of the vascular anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon, this succeeds without any problems despite a clear caliber advantage on the part of the superior thyroid artery, followed immediately by good venous return. Conditioning of an anterior internal jugular vein, measurement of a size 3.5 coupler, problem-free performance of the venous anastomosis with the coupler, immediate regular flow with good flap perfusion. Careful positioning of the stalk and, if flap vitality is normal, cervical insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure on the left side using the raised skin monitor. Final laryngoscopic check. The graft is intact with normal vitality as far as can be assessed here. Regular vitality in the area of the skin monitor and termination of the procedure at this point. Note: Due to an intraoperative drop in oxygen saturation, the recovery process was monitored in the operating theater. A detailed clinical, neurological diagnosis reveals an oriented and responsive patient with lateral motor function and reflexes as well as lateral pupils with regular light reflexes. Postoperative neurological monitoring of the patient and, if neurological deficits occur, neurological consultation with imaging. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT3 cN3 G3 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the left. The defect was reconstructed using an anterolateral transfemoral graft from the right with right cervical vascular anastomosis. Please monitor the flap via the sutured skin island and via enoral inspection with the patient awake. If possible, please leave the tracheal cannula in place for at least 5-7 days postoperatively due to the prelaryngeal vascular pedicle and leave the Redon drains in place for at least 3-4 days postoperatively. If flap vitality is normal, perform an X-ray pre-swallow on the 10th postoperative day. Due to the extent of the resection, a prolonged recovery of swallowing function can be expected.","Tumor resection, Radical neck dissection

Therefore indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Induction of anesthesia and intubation using a laser tube via the anesthesia. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the site. A flat exophytic mass is seen in the area of the vallecula with transition to the base of the tongue and the lingual surface of the epiglottis. Now insertion of the spreading laryngoscope and advance of the microscope including laser. Start with laser resection 4 watt continuous wave superpulse on the left side in the area of the base of the tongue. Then successive laser resection in the area of the base of the tongue down to the hyoid bone. Removal of the epiglottis in the lateral area on both sides. The epiglottis itself cannot be retained due to the tumor infiltration. The resection of the epiglottis was discussed in advance with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who also demonstrated the findings. The specimen is placed on cork for final histology. Then several marginal samples are taken. The marginal samples are all tumor-free in the frozen section. The decision is then made to perform a tracheostomy for functional reasons, as aspiration is to be expected. The tracheostomy was performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Hemostasis was performed using monopolar coagulation and vascular clips. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Now creation of a protective tracheostomy. Head reclination. Infiltration with local anesthetic Ultracaine 2% with Suprarenin added under the palpable cricoid cartilage with a total of 10 ml. Skin disinfection and sterile draping. Mark the landmarks and the level of the cricoid cartilage. One transverse finger below, mark the skin incision according to Kocher and cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissect down to the linea alba and enter it. Separation of the infrahyoid musculature and exposure of the small, sparse thyroid gland. Overall, hardened and fibrotic conditions after radiotherapy. Undermining of the thyroid gland and placement of the Pean clamps on the right and left. Cutting of the thyroid isthmus. Stitching of the thyroid gland on the right and left, after placement of the blocker and good view of the anterior tracheal surface.

Positioning of the patient and insertion of the mouth guard. Approximation of the tongue. An exophytic mass on the edge of the tongue with a dorsal leuoplakia is revealed. This mass is first incised with the electric needle and the resection margins are determined. It can be seen that the mass is very superficial, so that the body of the tongue is only covered superficially. The resection depth reaches a maximum of around 1 cm. The resection is performed successively and extremely carefully with subtle hemostasis and ligation of some larger arterial vessels. If the wound is dry, representative samples are taken from the margins, all of which are found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. This therefore appears to be an R0 resection. The tumor specimen is sent for final histopathological assessment in thread-reinforced form. Infiltration of the tongue with a long-acting local anesthetic. The edge of the tongue is then closed with inverted sutures. After aspiration of blood residue, removal of the mouth block. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection on both sides. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline cervically on both sides. Start on the right side, where numerous suspicious lumps were found on ultrasound. Incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side. Exposure of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma and layer-by-layer dissection in depth. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and digaster muscle. Insertion of the retractors. A large lymph node conglomerate can be seen in the venous angle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and long dissection of the same. Long-distance dissection and exposure of the accessorius nerve. Performing a neurolysis and re-embedding of the accessory nerve at the end of the operation. Similarly, long dissection of the vagus nerve with displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding. Resection of the lateral neck preparation from level IIa caudally to the level of the omohyoid muscle. All branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery can be spared. Clearing of the hypoglossal triangle. Long-distance dissection, relocation and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Here too, all vascular and nerve structures are preserved. Removal of the level III and IV anterior neck preparation. Exposure of the capsule of the submandibular gland and palpation in level I, where no suspicious masses can be palpated. Perform subtle hemostasis. Insertion of a size 10 Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure bandage. Repositioning for neck dissection on the left side. Here only sonographically enlarged, slightly suspicious nodes are visible. Here too, the incision is made along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth in layers and exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. This is also dissected over a long distance with long-distance exposure, displacement and re-embedding of the vagus nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Long-distance dissection, exposure, displacement and re-embedding of the accessory nerve in the sense of a neurolysis.

Entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the tumor. The tumor is very difficult to locate. There is an exophytic mass in the area of the right vocal fold with transition into the anterior commissure and onto the left vocal fold. In the area of the right vocal fold, the mass extends to the vocal process and into the morgue sinus. On the left side, the mass extends to the posterior third of the vocal fold and also into the morgue sinus. The folds of the pocket are only partially affected, if at all, on the right side. Due to the poor adjustability, partial laryngectomy from the outside. Therefore sterile washing and draping. Zigzag skin incision. Exposure of the prelarygneal musculature. Push the prelaryngeal muscles to the side. Incision of the perichondrium on the thyroid cartilage. Pushing off the perichondrium. Incision of the thyroid cartilage in the median. The thyrohyoid membrane was previously split in the middle. Opening of the larynx and inspection of the tumor. The tumor is located as described above. First, the right side of the thyroid cartilage is removed. This is successful without any problems. Deposition of the vocal process with the Kittel scissors in the posterior region. Deposition of the tumor on the subglottic slope and in the area of the morgue sinus. On the anterior part, the tumor extends slightly into the pocket fold, so part of the pocket fold is removed here. Transition to the left side. Here the tumor is also pushed away from the thyroid cartilage and deposited in the posterior third of the vocal fold. Removal of the morgue sinus and placement of the tumor in the anterior commissure. This results in tearing of the tumor. There is no infiltration of the thyroid cartilage in any areas. The tumor ruptures in the anterior commissure and is thread-marked in two pieces for final histology. Samples are taken from all margins as well as from the depth. All marginal samples are in frozen section R0. Transition to reconstruction of the larynx. First, the mucosa of the pocket fold is sutured to the mucosa of the subglottic region on the left side. Insertion of two drill holes through the thyroid cartilage in the area of the anterior commissure. Here, the pocket fold in the left area is fixed forward so that ultimately no thyroid cartilage is exposed. The same procedure is performed on the right side. On the right side, however, a small section in the anterior region can no longer be closed. This means that the mucosa of the pocket fold cannot be connected to the subglottic region in this area, as too much mucosa has been resected here. However, it is possible to fix the pocket fold to the anterior commissure on the right side in order to leave all edges of the anterior commissure covered with mucosa to prevent synechiae from forming. Finally, drill holes in the posterior area and suture the thyroid cartilage. Suturing of the remaining soft tissues, perichondrium, muscle fascia, muscle and subcutaneous tissue in layers. A flap was previously inserted. Application of a pressure bandage. A tracheostomy was not performed intraoperatively if the wound conditions were good. The patient should be fed via the inserted nasogastric tube for at least five days. The patient should then be carefully fed and presented at the tumor conference.

Incision of the trachea below the third tracheal clasp and insertion of the tube after reintubation of the patient. Subsequent infiltration with local anesthetic containing adrenaline in the area of the subsequent apron flap incision. Sterile washing and draping. Sharp formation of the apron flap subplatysmal and elevation and fixation upwards in the usual manner to beyond the hyoid bone. Now start with the neck dissection on the right side. Mobilize the sternocleidomastoid muscle while protecting the medial and lateral parts of the accessorius nerve. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Opening of the vascular nerve sheath and skeletonization of the internal jugular vein and the carotid artery. Regions II to V are then removed, sparing all non-lymphatic structures. Subsequently, the superior thyroid artery is ligated,.............. Hypoglossus. Now detach the constrictor pharyngis muscle from the thyroid cartilage. Release the piriform sinus. Separation of the prelaryngeal and prethyroid muscles and lateral displacement of the right thyroid lobe. Subsequent transition to the opposite side. Similar procedure with the same findings. A suspicious lymph node metastasis is found macroscopically in the area of the facial angle, which is of course also removed. After appropriate mobilization of the larynx, an incision is made at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage. Dissection of a caudally pedicled mucosal flap, which is used to cover the tracheal chimney, in the usual way. Then dissect the larynx cranially. Enter the hypopharynx at the level of the arytenoid cartilage. Widen the incision to the right to ensure a good view of the tumor, which is mainly located on the left. The tumor is then released with a macroscopic safety margin of 0.5 to 1 cm. Cranially, parts of the vallecula and the base of the tongue are included in the resection. On subsequent inspection of the resected area, the impression is gained that the safety margin is somewhat smaller in the caudal resection area, both on the right and left. Therefore, resections are performed on both sides. The resulting mucosal defect is then circumcised and all specimens are sent for frozen section histological examination. These proved to be tumor-free. Only postcricoidal moderate dysplasia was found. Therefore, a resection and a further frozen section for normal histology are performed at this point. Subsequently, myotomy of the inferior constrictor muscle on the dorsal side of the hypopharynx. Insertion of a size 8 Provox Vega8 cannula. Completion of the tracheostoma by H-shaped incision of the third tracheal clasp and completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequent two-layer closure of the mucosal defect in a T-shape. The first layer contains an inverting continuous suture according to Conley. The second layer consists of the surrounding muscle tissue using a single button suture. Finally, three Redon drains are inserted on each side of the neck. Folding back the apron flap and two-layer wound closure with continuous skin suture by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Re-intubation of the patient onto a 10 mm tracheal cannula. Sterile wound dressing. End of the operation. Handover of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Total laryngectomy with selective neck dissection of regions II to V on both sides, for supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma. Primary voice rehabilitation by insertion of a size 8 Provox-Vega prosthesis and myotomy of the contrictor pharyngis muscle. Insertion of a tracheal chimney according to Herrmann. Please carry out a postoperative X-ray broad swallow on the 7th to 10th day. If a fistula is excluded, removal of the gastric tube and start of oral nutrition and phonation.

The panendoscopy performed at the same time showed no primary tumor. Likewise, no primary could be found in the PET-CT.","After induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues, tracheoscopy by the surgeon. The trachea is visible up to the bifurcation. Subsequent intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Repositioning for hypopharyngo-laryngoscopy. Entry with the Kleinsasser C-tube and inspection of the base of the tongue, epiglottic vallecula, right and left piriform sinus, postcricoidal region and esophageal entrance. No pathological changes here. Using the large double spoon, several samples are now taken from the base of the tongue on the right and left sides, which are sent for final histology. The endolarynx is then adjusted. No pathological changes here either. Repositioning for tonsillectomy on both sides. Insertion of the McIVOR oral spatula and palpation of the base of the tongue, floor of the mouth and the tonsils on both sides. No pathological resistance here. The tonsils are symmetrical on both sides and relatively atrophic. Start with tonsillectomy on the right side. Mucosal incision at the upper fold. Exposure of the tonsil capsule. Extension of the mucosal incision at the anterior posterior arch caudally and successive detachment of the tonsil from the capsule with the rasparatorium while sparing the anterior and posterior palatal arch. Separation of the tonsil at the caudal pole and bipolar coagulation of the caudal pole. There is no bleeding in the tonsil lobe on the right. Insertion of a hydrogen-soaked swab. Approach for tonsillectomy on the left side. Identical procedure here. No bleeding here either, after exposing the tonsil capsule and detaching the tonsil up to the caudal pole. Here, too, the palatal arch was spared anteriorly and posteriorly. Also bipolar coagulation at the caudal tonsil pole. Insertion of a hydrogen-soaked swab. Removal of the hydrogen-soaked swab. No evidence of further bleeding. Insertion of the velotraction and visualization of the nasopharynx. The posterior edge of the septum is clear, the tubal bulges are also unremarkable. No indication of a pathological change. Incision with Beckmann's ring knife and removal of minimal residual adenoids. Hemostasis using a hydrogen-soaked swab. No evidence of further bleeding after removal of the swab. Transfer for esophagoscopy and PEG placement. Entering with the esophagoscope under constant air insufflation into the stomach and distension of the stomach. There is a clear diaphanoscopy, despite obesity. Under the lower left paramedian rib, sterile draping. Injection of Ultracaine. Incision and puncture of the trocar without complications. Subsequent placement of the PEG using the thread pull-through method without problems. Repositioning for neck dissection on the left side. Injection of 6 ml ultracaine solution. Creation of an arched skin incision starting at the mastoid, pulling along the posterior sternal border in an anterior direction. This incision is chosen because the relatively large metastasis is located on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Sterile covering. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the platysma and creation of the platysmal flap. Locate the sternocleidomastoid and dissect the anterior edge of the muscle in depth. Successive detachment of the muscle. The auricularis magnus nerve is exposed in the anterior region. This is dissected and displaced caudally without severing it. The omohypoid muscle is then exposed and the retractor is inserted caudally. It can be seen that at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle from level II b to III, the metastasis is directly adjacent to the muscle without infiltrating it. Successive detachment of the metastasis in the cranial region from the muscle and search for the digastric muscle. Dissection of the digastric muscle and insertion of the cranial retractor. The accessorius nerve can then be exposed. This is spared until the end of the operation. Now dissect around the large cervical metastasis and detach the metastasis from level I after exposing the submandibular gland, which is pulled cranially with the Langebeck. Dissection around level II b up to level III. Now successive release of the metastasis, whereby a little thick secretion is emptied from the metastasis in the cranial region. Now visualization of the internal jugular vein and the facial vein. The internal jugular vein is displaced posteriorly/dorsally by the tumor, but can be spared. Dissection also reveals the cervical vein, which is traced in an anterior and caudal direction and is also spared until the end of the operation. Another small lymph node is found caudal to the mass, which is removed with the entire neck preparation. Subsequent dissection along the cervical vascular sheath and detachment of the fatty tissue from levels II and III up to level IV, with ligation in the caudal area to avoid a chyle fistula. No intraoperative evidence of chyle flow. Now turn to level II a. Here, the remaining fatty tissue cranial to the accessorius nerve is successively detached from the scalene muscles and then removed. Finally, the wound is irrigated with H2O2 and Ringer's and checked for hemostasis, which is present. Insertion of a Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure and completion of the procedure without complications. Conclusion: No evidence of primarius in the CUP panendoscopy. A TE/AT and trial biopsy from the base of the tongue on the right, left and median as well as a neck dissection on the left were performed.

During the tumor follow-up in the radiation clinic, a lymph node metastasis in the right angle of the jaw was noticed, so the patient was sent to us for further staging. We found a soft palate carcinoma on the right anterior palatal arch and a palpatory induration in the sense of a posterior right tongue margin carcinoma both clinically and subsequently in the panendoscopy. In addition, a sample was taken at 2 sites on the posterior wall of the oropharynx during the panendoscopy and carcinoma in situ was detected twice, once with transition to an invasive carcinoma. Therefore indication for the above procedure.","First, the patient is brought into the operating room and actively identified. Then induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Carry out the team time-out. The surgeon then positions the patient. Insertion of the Mc Ivor oral catheter. First assessment of the back surface of the oropharynx. Here, scarred conditions, partially whitish, non-wipeable mucosal changes starting paramedian on the left to almost the pharyngeal side wall on the right. In addition, an approx. 8 mm large carcinoma was found on the anterior palatal arch on the right side with a central ulcer, of which no histology was taken in the preliminary examination. This will now be completely resected. Subsequently, multiple marginal samples are taken and everything is sent for frozen section. Here the finding of a further carcinoma (the 3rd) is confirmed. Tumor-free in the frozen section. A defect of approx. 2 x 1 cm is created here. However, the posterior palatal arch is not affected. Now proceed to resection of the tongue margin carcinoma posteriorly on the right, extending to the base of the tongue. Insert the Jennings retractor for this. The tongue is then ligated and pulled out. The tumor is then palpated extensively and the borders marked with the bipolar. Gradually remove the tumor with a safety distance of 0.5 to 1 cm using the electric needle. Palpate again and again. At the end, the tumor can be completely removed. Bleeding is stopped bipolar. Now all-round and deep marginal samples. A frozen section shows that there is no tumor here either, and the Mc Ivor oral spatula is inserted again and the back surface of the oropharynx is inspected. Here, whitish mucosal conditions with scarring starting paramedian on the left and running obliquely downwards on the right. The electric needle is now passed around these, primarily creating a defect of approx. 2 x 1 cm. This is then dissected downwards on the muscle layer so that it remains intact. The prevertebral fascia is not exposed. The defect then becomes correspondingly larger due to the surface tension and reaches a size of approx. 3 x 2 cm. Between 12 and 4 o'clock, the mucosa continues to appear whitish and is therefore resected again. Due to the already large defect, no marginal samples are taken here, but the absence of tumor is determined on these 2 specimens after telephone consultation with the pathology department. Here, too, there is no tumor. Now a small mass approx. 2 x 1 mm at the cranial left tonsil pole above the tonsil is removed, also with a small safety margin. Primarily not suspicious. Final histology here. Subsequent transfer of the operation for neck dissection to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First marking of the skin incision after skin ablation cervical right. Sterile draping. Creation of an anteriorly curved skin incision. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure and ligation of the various branches of the external jugular vein. Sparing of the auricularis magnus nerve. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, digaster muscle and accessorius nerve. Sparing of the above structures. Dissection along the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial with exposure of the cervical vascular sheath along the entire length. In the area of region Ib and IIa, a highly suspicious mass was found, which was carefully dissected away from the internal jugular vein and removed in toto. Successive evacuation of the posterior and anterior neck specimen with removal of several conspicuous lymph nodes in regions III and IV. Repeated inspection. Dry conditions. Placement of a Redon drainage. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure bandage. Completion of the procedure without complications.","Resection of tongue margin carcinoma, Modified radical neck dissection

With CT evidence of infiltration of the entire right hemilarynx, the above-mentioned procedure is indicated.","Introductory consultation with the anesthesiologist. Repositioning of the patient and repeated endoscopic examination of the tumor region. The above-mentioned tumor extension is confirmed, so that the indication is confirmed. Subsequently, flexible esophagogastroscopy with PEG insertion with positive diaphanoscopy and positive tenting phenomenon using the thread pull-through method. This succeeds loco typico without any problems. Retraction of the esophagoscope and fixation of the PEG tube. Dressing is applied. Subsequent positioning of the patient and injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline in the area of the apron flap. Skin incision and dissection of the apron flap to expose the cervical vascular sheath and the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides. Then start with the neck dissection on the left side. No suspicious lymph nodes are found during the dissection. Neck dissection is carried out in the area of levels Ib, II, III, IV and partially V. During neck dissection, the cervical vascular sheath is exposed over a long distance. Long-distance dissection, displacement and re-embedding of the vagus nerve in the sense of neurolysis. Long-distance dissection, displacement and re-embedding of the accessory nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Same procedure in the area of the hypoglossal nerve. The entire neck preparation is sent for histopathological examination. Transition to the tumor side. Here, a lymph node conglomerate is seen in the area of the venous angle, which extends into the accessorius triangle. The number and size of the lymph nodes are also conspicuous down to level V. Here, too, the cervical vascular sheath is dissected over a long distance and the vagus nerve, accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve are exposed, relocated and re-embedded in the sense of a neurolysis. Complete evacuation of the hypoglossal triangle and the accessorius triangle as well as the lateral and medial neck preparation, resulting in a level Ib to V neck dissection. All branches of the internal jugular vein and the external carotid artery can be preserved on both sides during dissection. Exposure of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage. Here, the hyoid bone is released from the cranial side by separating the suprahyoid muscles. Subsequent release of the posterior horn of the thyroid cartilage on both sides. This also involves severing the vascular nerve bundle. Exposure of the lateral surface of the thyroid cartilage on the left side and release of the pharyngeal tube. Caudal dissection of the thyroid lobe. It is clear that the thyroid lobe is not covered by the tumor on either side, especially not on the right side. In this case, the thyroid gland has been removed, but a marginal sample was taken for frozen section diagnosis. This was found to be tumor-free during the operation. In addition, the thyroid isthmus is cut, which is cut off on both sides, thus exposing the anterior surface of the trachea. The trachea is opened between the 1st and 2nd cartilage clasps and a visor tracheotomy is prepared, through which the patient is cannulated after extubation. Opening of the pharynx at the level of the epiglottis and preparation of the pharyngeal tube. Care is taken to ensure that the largest possible width of pharynx is retained on the left side. Carefully detach the pharynx from the laryngeal skeleton. This provides a very good view and control of the tumor. The tumor is incised far into the healthy tissue. The tumor extension described above is again confirmed, so that the option of a partial laryngeal resection is now definitively ruled out. The dissection continues caudally by further detaching the pharynx. At the level of the cricoid cartilage, where there is certainly no more tumor infiltration, further detachment of the larynx and subsequent removal of the larynx directly below the cricoid cartilage. Subsequent subtle hemostasis. Taking marginal samples from the tumor specimen. Here, the medial margin sample is infiltrated in a frozen section as a carcinoma in situ. However, due to the fact that the mucosa appears completely free of irritation and there is only a narrow margin of pharyngeal mucosa in the area of the caudal tumor deposit, the decision is made not to take any further margin samples in this area in order to avoid the need for pharyngeal reconstruction using a free flap graft. After subtle hemostasis, insertion of a Provox prosthesis in loco typico. This is also successful without any problems. Pharyngeal closure after performing the myotomy, which is performed laterally on both sides. Subsequent pharyngeal closure with single button sutures and then two layers of continuous sutures. The pharynx is closed at the base of the tongue in a horizontal scar line and otherwise in a vertical line. Dissection of the infrahyoid musculature, which was displaced caudally together with the thyroid gland. This is now also sutured in front of the pharynx and fixed to the base of the tongue. Repeated bleeding control in the area of the neck dissection. Dry wound conditions here too. The apron flap is then folded back and the tracheostoma sutured in place. Closure of the skin incision on both sides with subcutaneous and skin sutures. Insertion of a tracheal cannula. Application of a pressure bandage on both sides. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Completion of the procedure. To splint the pharynx, the nasogastric tube inserted at the beginning of the operation by the anesthesia colleagues remains in place postoperatively. Nutrition should be provided via the PEG. The patient is admitted to the in-house intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Swallowing attempt on the 10th postoperative day.","Laryngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement

The above-mentioned operation was therefore indicated.,"Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Pharyngoscopy/laryngoscopy: The exophytic tumor is visible, which completely fills the piriform sinus, infiltrates the larynx over a wide area, occupies almost the entire postcricoid region, extends into the piriform apex and also extends into the piriform sinus lateral wall with small flat extensions. Indication for surgery thus confirmed. Repositioning of the patient, skin disinfection and sterile draping of all surgical areas. First start with neck dissection and pharyngectomy: injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine with adrenaline into both sides of the neck along the apron incision. Then first subplatysmal dissection of the apron flap in the typical manner up to the level of the hyoid bone or submandibular gland. Then start with the neck dissection on the right: dissection of the fat-lymph node preparation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of digastric muscle, omohyoid muscle and infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal/external carotid artery, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. Clearing of neck levels II to V while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Glandula submandibularis remains in situ. Subsequent neck dissection on the left side: Here the procedure is the same, but only removal of levels II to IV and small parts of V. Then laryngectomy: Exposure of the hyoid bone. This is separated from the suprahyoid musculature. Removal of the preglottic fatty tissue with dissection up to the entrance to the pharynx. Expose the superior chorda. Dissection of the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle. This is dissected to the right of the hyoid bone, but not resected further. The thyroid gland is dissected away caudolaterally on the right and the thyroid isthmus is separated after clamping and puncture ligation. Same procedure on the left. Dissection of the pharyngeal constrictor muscle and release of the piriform sinus. Also dissection of the thyroid gland caudolaterally. Then enter the epiglottis into the laryngeal or pharyngeal space. Exposure of the tumor. This is resected at a distance of 1 to 1.5 mm in the tumor border area, in the pharyngeal area. Microscopic inspection reveals extensions, the entire right pharyngeal wall falls just above the midline. On the left, the largest part of the pharynx can be preserved. In the area of the sinus tip, the defect is too large for a primary suture. The suture-marked preparation is sent to ....................... for frozen section histology. The tumor appears relatively close to the right side in the area of the transition from the postcricoid region to the laryngeal skeleton. Therefore, adjacent soft tissue in the form of fatty tissue, pharyngeal wall tissue and also thyroid tissue is resected from the upper pole and sent in as a right basal margin specimen. This was found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. Carcinoma in situ in the area of the entire right border. Also caudally at the transition to the esophagus. Therefore, a resection was performed using a mucosal strip several mm thick, certainly 5 to 7 mm thick, certainly 1 cm thick, from the area of the right pharyngeal wall down to the postcricoid area and the border to the pharyngeal area on the left. Then a marginal sample from the same area. This is now sent for frozen section histology. No more infiltrates here. Thus, apart from possible skip growth, the resection is R0. Myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle, pars fundiformis on the left side slightly dorsally. This widens the relatively narrow esophageal opening. After the resection, a radial flap is always indicated to cover the defect. Irrigation of the entire wound area with hydrogen and Ringer's solution and careful hemostasis. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Flap elevation of the radialis flap and coverage with split skin from the right thigh. After specifying a required graft of 11 x 9.5 cm by <CLINICIAN_NAME> with monitor island, the graft is first marked and aligned and then incised. Removal of the skin and preservation of the blood supply to the monitor. Due to the physiognomy of the patient, the width of the graft must be selected up to the extensor side. Subfascial release, careful radial exploration and preservation of the superficial ramus, radial nerve, but this must be neurolyzed over a long distance. This is ultimately successful. Maintenance of graft perfusion. Ulnar subfacial dissection, here careful dissection of the long superficial ulnar artery with clear kinking. Exposure of the radial artery. Clamping of the radial artery and later, after approx. 30 minutes without changing the good oxygen saturation of the hand, removal of the radial artery subfascially to develop the graft. Removal of the skin monitor while lifting a wide subfascial tissue anathema. Trace the graft or the vessels into the crook of the elbow, here the radial artery is isolated, the antosseous artery is relatively weak and is removed to obtain the pedicle length if the defect is extensive. There is a confluence of the superficial vein after elevation of the brachiocephalic vein with a wide bridge, which takes up the vein ............. of the radial artery and opens into a very strong cubital vein. In addition, 2 smaller venous outlets with drainage into the deep system are preserved. Careful hemostasis and, if the graft is vital on both sides, final placement of the graft after the supply and return vessels have been treated. The graft is then successively inserted into the pharyngeal defect using a special expansion suture in the area of the esophageal entrance. The operation is then handed over again. Incision of the radial flap: The flap measures 11 x 10 cm. It is sutured around the remaining remnants of the subtotally resected pharynx. This is done with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. In the area of the esophageal opening, incision and suturing of the triangular flap. Gastric tube already in place. A second row of sutures is made at the base of the tongue and on the sides. The infrahyoid musculature is sutured caudally over the flap connected to the esophagus, with the thyroid gland still lying over it. The flap is then connected to the vessels. The superior thyroid artery on the right is selected as well as a large outlet from the facial vein and a smaller outlet from a larger outgoing thyroid vein. After conditioning the vessels, suture the radial artery to the superior thyroid artery using 8-0 Vicryl single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. A larger outgoing vein from the facial vein is selected for the larger vein from the cephalic region. Anastomosis using a 4-0 coupler after measuring. After opening the clamps, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. An outlet from the area of the deep venous system is connected to a small outlet from an outgoing thyroid vein, after measuring the width using a 2-0 coupler. Again, good venous return after opening the clamps. Positive smear phenomenon. Finally, careful hemostasis again. Any open veins, venous or arterial vessels are clipped or ligated. The skin monitor was sutured into the skin via a small median cranial incision, tension-free. Subsequent careful irrigation and hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of 2 Penrose drains on the right and one Redon drain on the left and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Subsequently insertion of a 10 tracheal cannula, which is fixed with sutures. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is admitted to the interdisciplinary intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Flap control according to scheme by means of skin monitor control and Doppler sonography. Antibiotics continued for one week with Unacid. Feeding via the PEG tube for 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Overall cT4a hypopharyngeal carcinoma with infiltration of the larynx. Postoperative RT or RCT according to lymph node status.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Injection of local anesthetic with the addition of suprarenin in the neck and sterile abjoration. First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: the exophytic tumor is seen, which starts below the tonsil lobe or former tonsil lobe and extends towards the posterior wall of the oropharynx, the lateral wall of the oropharynx, the base of the tongue and also down towards the hypopharynx. Clear indication for surgical resection with subsequent flap coverage using a microvascular graft. Now start with the tracheostoma placement. Skin incision over approx. 4 1/2 cm below the cricoid cartilage, dissection through the platysma, search for the pretracheal muscles and insertion in the median line. Push the muscles laterally. The cricoid cartilage and the trachea can be easily palpated. Now locate the upper pole of the thyroid gland and expose it. Successive transection of the thyroid gland from cranial to caudal using a bipolar and scissors. The thyroid lobes are bluntly pushed off, the trachea is now exposed. The incision is now made between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp and a Björk flap is created while protecting the tube cuff. Suturing of the Björk flap and reintubation. Subsequent skin disinfection and sterile draping of all relevant surgical areas, including the pectoralis major areas. First start with neck revision on the left: Opening of the old scar. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The V. jugularis externa is preserved and ligated as well as beaten caudally. Subsequent laborious dissection of the cervical vascular sheath through the scarring. The internal jugular vein can be visualized, but without any branches. Some ligatures can be visualized. The internal and external carotid arteries are then visualized. The hypoglossal artery is completely connected to the carotid artery or the bifurcation and can only be mobilized with difficulty. The facial artery and the lingual artery can be preserved from the external carotid artery and can be beaten laterally after clipping. Successive isolation of the pharyngeal tube from caudal to cranial, dissection of the large cervical vessels cranially. The styloid process is also resected cranially. During dissection, the digastric muscle is also severed and the submandibular gland is removed in the typical manner, exposing the lingual nerve and sparing the branch of the mouth, which can be exposed over a short distance. Lymph nodes are removed cranially at the parotid gland and also around the submandibular gland as well as latrally in the area of level V and laterally IV, III and II. Some lymph nodes were also removed anteriorly. Finally, complete isolation of the pharyngeal tube from the large vessels. Hypoglossal nerve preserved. Subsequently, after insertion of mouth blockers, combined removal of the tumor from the inside and outside. Tumor is removed macroscopically with a safety margin of 1.5 cm, in some cases also 1 cm. The entire side wall of the oropharynx and most of the posterior wall is removed up to the beginning of the posterior wall of the hypopharynx, which is also partially removed. At the top, lateral resection of the mucosa up to the bone at the alveolar ridge, lateral part of the tongue body or base of the tongue is also resected, including the parts of the extrinsic musculature. This is then beaten outwards and released from the piriform sinus with a wide safety margin. In the area of the larynx, it can be seen that the tumor has grown up to the edge of the vallecula or the epiglottis and has also grown up to the thyroid cartilage. Therefore, resection of the base of the tongue and vallecula, including lateral parts of the epiglottis and lateral parts of the thyroid cartilage as well as the largest parts of the arytenoid fold. Resection extends to the middle level of the piriform sinus or just to the tip of the sinus. Marginal samples are also taken from the alveolar ridge and the base of the tongue, including the epiglottis and vallecula. In addition, marginal samples from the arytenoid region up to the piriform sinus and marginal samples from the adjacent arytenoid region up to the supraglottic region are taken. The tumor is thread-marked and sent for frozen section like all other marginal samples. In the area of the aryepiglottic fold and in the area of the arytenoid region to the subglottic region still partly carcinoma in situ. Maximum moderate dysplasia in the remaining area. Due to the advanced resection in the area of the larynx, a final, approx. 0.5 to 1 cm wide mucosal resection from the arytenoid region to the piriform sinus, whereby the postcricoid region is already resected. Another 0.5 to 1 cm wide resection from the supraglottic region including the arytenoid region. The arytenoid cartilage is now exposed, as is the aryepiglottic fold lateral to the larynx or supraglottic region. Both specimens are also marked remote from the tumor and sent for final evaluation. Further resections are no longer performed due to the significant threat of inability to swallow. Subsequent irrigation of the wound area and hemostasis. Now proceed to neck dissection on the right side. Here, skin incision exactly in the pre-existing scar from the mastoid to caudal towards the jugulum. Then cut through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Then skin platysmal flap formation in the cranial anterior and caudal lateral direction, including the platysma. Subsequent exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Massively scarred conditions. It can now be seen that the common carotid artery with the bifurcation lies directly on the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is now dissected. The area of the bifurcation is heavily scarred. The internal jugular vein is no longer present in the case of previous surgery. Dissection along the weakly atrophied omohyoid muscle antero-cranially to the hyoid bone. Subsequent exposure of the posterior digaster venter muscle. Subsequently, sparse fatty tissue with hardly any lymph nodes is removed. The external jugular vein is also no longer present. However, 2 stronger veins can be found and dissected in the anterior triangle of the neck. The superior thyroid artery is also dissected 3 cm long after its exit from the external carotid artery. Further vascular dissection is then performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequent removal of the forearm flap: The size of the flap was measured beforehand. It is 11 x 8 cm and is planned three-dimensionally according to the requirements. Marking of the flap on the forearm. Curved skin incision up to the crook of the elbow. First cut the flap ulnarly. Lift the flap subfascially here. Ensure that some tissue remains on all tendons. Dissect cranially. Expose the superficial venous system, which shows a beautiful superficial vein with 2 ends in the area of the elbow. Connection to the deep venous system somewhat sparse but present. Then cut around the flap radially subfascially. Here, too, care is taken to ensure that tissue remains on the fascia. Distally, after clamping the radial artery and sufficiently long saturation over 98 to 100 %, the radial artery is removed and ligated with 4-0 prolene sutures as a through-layer ligature. The flap is then lifted along the pedicle. Small branches are clipped and bipolar coagulated. Successive tracing of the flap up to the olecranon. Here, transection of the interosseous artery after previous clamping with stable saturation. Then expose the confluence and radial artery. The vein is then removed and ligated. The artery is removed and closed with 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Flush the flap with heparin. The flap is then sutured into the defect. This is done without tension and completely except for a small remnant at the front of the tongue body. Adapting sutures are placed in the tongue body. An incision is made in the area of the larynx along the thyroid cartilage, an incision on the mucous membrane is not possible, as due to the................................. postcricoid mucosa, there is a risk of stenosis. Insertion sometimes with poor visibility and sometimes quite difficult. The stalk is now assessed with regard to connectivity. Conditioning of the radial artery and the two veins, whereby one of the cephalic veins, which is selected for the anastomosis, shows significantly thickened walls, even beyond the valve, and must be shortened. Subsequently, split skin is removed from the thigh with the dermatome, thickness approx. 0.8 mm. Starch is also applied to the wound area in the thigh and then a semi-permeable dressing is applied. Split skin is applied to the forearm without tension. Relief incision. A few swabs are sewn on to facilitate adhesion. Followed by Mepilex dressing. Wrapping with absorbent cotton and the application of some compresses. Then fitting of a Kramer splint and wrapping with an elastic bandage in a functional position. Positioning of the arm. Subsequent vascular suture. This is followed by anastomosis with the lingual and radial arteries. Suture with 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. Subsequent opening of the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. One of the cephalic veins is conditioned again for the venous anastomosis. In addition, the external jugular vein, which can be extended slightly by palpation. Here anastomosis with coupler 2.5. After opening the clamps good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The 2nd of the cephalic veins is connected to a vein from the opposite side, which can be dissected from the submandibular gland in the sense of a facial vein and can be removed. After slight mobilization, this vein can be transferred to the left side through a tunnel that has been created and anastomosed with the second cephalic vein after appropriate conditioning using a 2.5 mm coupler. Here too, after opening the clamps, the smear phenomenon was positive. However, the pressure in the vein was slightly higher due to the lack of internal jugular vein on the right. Overall, difficult conditions as far as vessel preparation is concerned. Subsequently, the flap is well perfused. Extensive hemostasis and irrigation follows. Hemostasis of diffuse bleeding, especially on the left, is considerably more difficult and prolonged. Finally, the small diffuse bleedings were largely stopped and closed by inserting a Redon drainage and 2 flaps on the left. The forearm was primarily closed in the cranial area. Finally, insertion of a size 8 tracheostomy tube, which is fixed in the typical manner with sutures. Further inspection of the flap, which is well perfused. The procedure is completed without complications. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics for a total of 1 week. Nutrition via the PEG tube. After 12-14 days, gruel swallowing and, if necessary, diet build-up. A prolonged swallowing disorder is to be expected, in this case it is essential to plan a visit to the voice and speech department. Flap control clinically and by Doppler sonography typically for 5 days. Anticoagulation should be suspended until coagulation control, then restarted if necessary due to the diffuse bleeding tendency. Presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference is essential because the R situation is still uncertain; if there is still in situ carcinoma in the left laryngeal region, boost radiation should be discussed if necessary.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheostomy creation, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

This reveals an exophytic tumor that infiltrates parauvularly from the anterior palatal arch into the tonsil, where it reaches close to the last molar and from there merges into the glossoalveolar groove. From there it infiltrates further into the base of the tongue and the upper edge of the hypopharynx. In the CT scan, it does not appear to be a strong tumor extension towards the vascular sheath, but rather a largely superficial growth. After extensive inspection, the possibility of resection using TORS is confirmed with overall good adjustability and good mouth opening of the patient. Insertion of the mouth retractor and good exposure of the tumor. After docking the patient cart of the robot, insertion of the instruments. Maryland forceps are used on the left and a monopolar spatula with a diameter of 8 mm is used on the right. First mark the resection margins using the monopolar spatula. The incision begins parauvularly. The resection is performed successively with a safety margin of about 5-10 mm in the extension described above. Part of the posterior palatal arch can be preserved so that the patient can swallow without regurgitation. The resectate can be removed en bloc together with the part of the base of the tongue and the orohypoharyngeal junction. The resection is carried out laterally into the parapharyngeal fatty tissue. The vessels of the cervical vascular sheath remain well covered by tissue. Overall, no major bleeding during the entire course of the operation. After the tumor is removed en bloc, first meticulous hemostasis. Careful inspection of the specimen. The tumor appears macroscopically distant from the healthy tissue. Therefore, marginal samples are now taken from the tumor specimen. These are sent in for frozen section diagnostics and assessed intraoperatively as tumor-free by the pathologist. This therefore appears to be an R0 resection of the specimen. The tumor specimen is thread-marked for final histopathological evaluation. Another intensive intraoperative check of the findings. Due to the exposed parapharyngeal fatty tissue, it is decided to perform the neck dissection on both sides in order to prevent fistula formation. Due to the fact that the patient was very easy to intubate and there was no serious bleeding during the entire course of the operation, it was decided not to perform a tracheostomy on the patient for the time being. Instead, the patient should be monitored in the intensive care unit for at least 3-4 days postoperatively. Subsequently, planning of neck dissection on both sides and, if necessary, adjuvant therapy in the tumor conference.","TORS procedure

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment was recommended. Even with promptly planned surgical treatment, a cN3 neck status with an indistinguishable internal carotid artery was found preoperatively, but CT showed intact conditions here. No evidence of distant metastasis.","After preparation and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, a pharyngoscopy was performed and the extent of the tumor was checked again. An exophytic tumor was found in the area of the uvula with markedly uneven mucosal extensions towards the soft palate and the tonsillar lobes on both sides. Overall, however, the tumor is somewhat left-sided. The tonsils themselves are inconspicuous and free, no significant deep growth. Submucosal growth was ruled out, so that the tumor was initially resected en bloc with a safety margin of a good 1.5 cm. After safe complete resection, the tumor is resected with tonsillectomy on both sides. Left Performing a tumor tonsillectomy with removal of the anterior palatal arch on the right side. Classic tonsillectomy using the dissection technique, providing a good overview of the posterior palatal arch and the posterior surface of the soft palate. Resection macroscopically far in sano with subtotal removal of the soft palate, the tumor is also completely resected in sano on the specimen. Now removal of completely covering margin samples. The invasive carcinoma is resected in sano, but in the area of the posterior surface of the soft palate, with a macroscopic safety margin of approx. 2 cm, there is discontinuous Cis at the edge of the deposit, so a complete resection is performed here as well as the removal of an additional covering margin sample, which shows no higher-grade dysplasia or Cis, so that the final situation is R0. After measuring the defect, the patient is turned to PEG placement. The gastroscope is inserted under laryngoscopic control into the stomach without any problems, here with excellent diaphanoscopy, the stomach is punctured without any problems and the PEG tube is inserted using the usual thread pull-through method. The patient is then repositioned. Injection of xylocaine with adrenaline in the neck area. Initially, due to the extensive soft tissue infiltration and infiltration of the internal jugular vein on the left, turn to neck dissection on the right to secure the vascular status. Curved skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection and preservation of the strong facial vein, the extremely slender superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve with cervical anus. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Subsequent evacuation of level Va with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches, here macroscopically no suspicious nodules overall so that after wound irrigation the procedure is moved to the opposite side. Here, with infiltration of the directly subcutaneously located metastasis of the caudal parotid gland, the incision is curved around the lobule in the direction of the mastoid and then diverted cervically. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, preserving the platysma caudally. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Anterior exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle, which is clearly infiltrated in the area of the posterior venter. Release of the lobule, dissection down to the mastoid, the mass infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle over a wide area directly into the subcutaneous level, here infraauricularly thin conditions, so that cloudy secretion is discharged at points when attempting to dissect the skin, therefore leaving the entire skin area, here above the metastasis en bloc resection, here of a spindle of 2 x 2.5 cm and thus complete coverage, otherwise no skin infiltration. Dissection of the soft tissue mantle. After visualization of the cervical vascular sheath caudally and safe infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein, the muscle and vein were removed. Careful protection of the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Cranial dissection first of level V. Numerous nodules here, additionally here also circumscribed black pigmented changes, corresponding to the aspect of melanin changes, complete removal. Caudal preservation of the cervical plexus. Complete cranial resection. Here, the mass is broadly overlying and infiltrating the paravertebral musculature. Extremely aggressive perinodal growth. Complete resection of the paravertebral musculature. Exposure of the carotid bulb and the hypoglossal nerve, which can be preserved. Clearly no infiltration. Infiltration of the branches of the external carotid artery, here the occipital artery, the facial artery. Separation of the vessels, otherwise no carotid infiltration. Cranial complete rupture of the jugular-facial angle, the vein can only be deposited in a healthy state just below the base of the skull, here treatment with ligature and puncture. Infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle as far as the mastoid, therefore the periosteum is completely taken away. Bone infiltration. Infiltration of the caudal parotid gland, here showing the marginal mandibular nerve, which can just be detached from the mass without infiltration drawings. Otherwise no growth towards the facial nerve trunk. Mobilization of the non-infiltrated submandibular gland and complete evacuation of level Ib while leaving the gland intact and removal of the metastasis en bloc in toto with macroscopic in sano resection. Subsequently, careful treatment of the detached vessels, wound irrigation with H202 and Ringer's solution and insertion of two 10-gauge Redon drains as well as careful two-layer wound closure and circumscribed execution of relief incisions to close the current defect. The radialis graft is then removed from the left forearm. Marking of the graft, measuring a total of 11.5 x 5.5 cm with a special configuration for the soft palate and tonsil lobe. Creation of the tourniquet. Cutting around the graft. Widening of the skin incision towards the crook of the elbow. Initial radial dissection. Exposure of the cephalic vein, which is taken along the lateral edge of the graft. Identification and careful protection of the radial superfacial nerve ramus. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle, ligation of the distal vascular pedicle. Free preparation of the brachioradialis muscle, followed by ulnar preparation. Exposure of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. Strictly subfacial release of the graft, proximal pedicle preparation including the cephalic vein. Exposure of a strong venous vascular bridge between the deep venous system and the strong cephalic vein. Exposure of the radial artery after securing the outlet of the ulnar artery. Subsequent reopening of the blood vessel with vital margins and vital graft. Careful hemostasis and removal of the graft. After careful hemostasis, the wound is closed in two layers and the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the right groin is implanted. The vacuum pump is then applied and the Cramer splint is placed in the functional site. Full-thickness skin harvesting from the right groin: For this purpose, incision of an area measuring approx. 12 x 5 cm, strictly cutaneous elevation. Subcutaneous mobilization, careful hemostasis and, after insertion of a 10 mm Redon drainage, careful multi-layer wound closure under moderate tension. The graft is then implanted after the right-sided pharyngotomy has been performed. This involved resection of the posterior digastric muscle. The pharyngotomy is performed transorally and transcervically. Widening of the pharyngotomy with as little muscle resection as possible. Creation of a 2.15 finger-wide tunnel. Insertion of the graft, successive suturing. This succeeds well and adequately with a good fit and complete coverage of the pharyngotomy. The graft vessels are then conditioned. The arterial vessels are then explored. Here, the arterial vessels on the right side are extremely narrow and calibrated. Proximal preparation of the facial artery, here somewhat stronger conditions. Due to the position, the arterial anastomosis is now performed with 8.0 Ethilon under significantly more difficult suturing conditions. Overall laborious adaptation, but finally sufficient anastomosis with immediate venous return. Conditioning of the facial vein and implementation of the venous anastomosis using the coupler system with a coupler size 4.0. Subsequent regular pedicle pulsation. Positive spreading phenomenon and vital graft enorally, so that after final wound inspection on the right cervical side, a 10-gauge Redon drain was inserted, followed by careful two-layer wound closure and completion of the procedure with a vital graft without any indication of complications. Note: The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g, which should be continued for 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT2 cN3 left-sided uvular carcinoma, extended radical neck dissection with subtotal removal of the cervical plexus and paravertebral musculature. Postoperative careful flap monitoring with vital conditions and regular enoral healing, gradual food intake can be started from the 7th postoperative day. A tracheotomy was deliberately avoided in the case of completely thin enoral conditions and no exposed wound surface. If the wound heals properly, prompt presentation for planning the absolutely necessary adjuvant therapy in the case of extremely aggressive and rapidly progressive cervical metastasis.","Tumor resection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Bilateral neck dissection, PEG placement

Then advance the 0° telescope through the glottic plane into the trachea. This is extremely difficult because it is very difficult to adjust the patient. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions in the area of the trachea and in the area of the bronchial system up to the exit of the segmental bronchi. Intubation of the patient by <CLINICIAN_NAME> using the glide laryngoscope. First inspect the postcricoid region and the hypopharynx on both sides: the mucosal conditions here are unremarkable. Now inspect the base of the tongue. No abnormalities here either. Inspection of the oropharynx reveals a clearly enlarged left tonsil with suspicious areas, with unremarkable findings in the area of the right tonsil. Pulling up the soft palate and inspection of the nasopharynx: Inconspicuous mucosal conditions here. Now advance the flexible oesophagoscope into the stomach. The mucosal conditions in the stomach and oesophagus are also normal. As discussed with the patient before the operation, the left tonsil is now removed as a tumor tonsillectomy. As far as can be assessed intraoperatively, the resection is successful in healthy tissue. The specimen is sent in its entirety for frozen section diagnostics. This reveals a circumscribed R1 resection in the area of the caudal margin. As a result, resection and collection of marginal samples, which are again found to be tumor-free during frozen section diagnostics. As part of the tumor tonsillectomy, the left tonsil and parts of the base of the tongue were resected. At the end of the operation, a mucosoplasty was performed in the area of the caudal margin to avoid scarring. After careful hemostasis, the procedure was completed.

After skin disinfection, subcutaneous infiltration with local anesthetic containing adrenaline in the area of the subsequent skin incision. Sterile washing and draping. Then initially perform the tracheostomy at the usual location. After skin incision, expose and undermine the thyroid isthmus. Open the trachea between the 3rd/4th tracheal clasp and insert the tube. Then complete the mucocutaneous anastomosis caudally. Then cut around the apron flap, which is successively folded up to the chin and fixed there. Then expose the prelaryngeal and prethyroid muscles, which are placed on the hyoid bone and folded caudally. Mobilize the hyoid bone also cranially, protecting the hypoglossal nerve and the lingual artery on both sides. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage and the thyrohyoid membrane. Exposure of the two lateral horns of the hyoid bone. Then open the hypopharynx at the left lateral hyoid horn. Then look at the right epiglottis margin, which is not infiltrated by the tumor. However, the tumor reaches about half of the epiglottis so that this is also resected. The tumor is then successively removed under vision using the monopolar knife with an appropriate safety margin. The resection encompasses the entire cranial vallecula. The base of the tongue is not affected. Caudally, the incision is made through the petiolus of the epiglottis without resection of parts of the thyroid cartilage. Ultimately, the tumor can be removed in its entirety in this way. Removal of marginal incisions circularly from the resection area, all of which prove to be tumor-free in the frozen section histological diagnosis. Subsequent transition to neck dissection on the left side. Here, a large metastasis is found in the area of region II, which infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle and also affects the caudal part of the parotid gland. This is first dissected from medial to lateral. In this way, the internal jugular vein can be safely protected and extracted. After securing the vascular nerve sheath, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is removed caudally and the mass is dissected cranially with resection of the accessorius nerve, which is completely surrounded by tumor masses, and removed in toto with resection of the caudal parotid pole. Neck dissection is then performed in region I with removal of the submandibular gland and regions IV and V. Transition to neck dissection on the right side. Here, too, there are several metastatic nodes, but they are mobile and not infiltrating. This means that regions I-V are completely removed on this side while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. The operation is then transferred to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The larynx is now moved cranially with several strong sutures on the lower jaw and positioned in the safe swallowing position under the base of the tongue. The prelaryngeal musculature is raised, completely covering the retaining sutures medially and refixed to the base of the tongue, thus forming the inner lining of the swallowing passage. Insertion of a Redon suction drain on both sides. Fold back the apron flap. Completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis in the area of the tracheostoma and two-layer wound closure on both cervical sides. Sterile wound dressing. End of the operation, transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Resection of a vallecula carcinoma on the right side via an external pharyngotomy with resection of the entire vallecula including the epipglottis. Reconstruction of the swallowing pathway by thyropexy on the lower jaw. Simultaneous selective neck dissection of regions I-V on the right side and modified radical neck dissection on the left side with resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the n. accessorius.","Hypopharyngeal partial resection (External pharyngotomy), Bilateral neck dissection

Due to the size of the tumor and the patient's wishes, the above-mentioned procedure was indicated.","First, induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues and transnasal intubation. Entry with the flexible oesophagogastroscope and endoscopy into the stomach. No abnormalities here. With good diaphanoscopy, insertion of a PEG tube using the thread pull-through method. This is successful without any problems. Insertion of a covered retractor, looping of the tongue and inspection of the carcinoma. The tongue tumor occupies 2/3 of the tongue on the right side, infiltrates the entire tip of the tongue and crosses the midline. First start with tumor resection using the monopolar needle and alternate dissection with scissors and bipolar forceps. The tumor is cut around successively. In the central area, the resection appears very close macroscopically. A thick slice is immediately resected and sent for final histology. Marginal samples are then taken and sent for frozen section. All marginal samples are tumor-free. Therefore intraoperative R0 situation. Due to the large remaining defect, which has also extended to the floor of the mouth, it is essential to cover the defect. This is done with a radialis graft. Then transition to neck dissection on the right side. Skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Release of the neck block II a to V a, sparing the plexus branches. The external and facial veins can be preserved. Level II contains several conspicuous, coarse nodes. Level II a to V a are removed while sparing the plexus branches and the accessorius nerve. Then neck dissection of the left side and tracheotomy (here follows dictation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>). Lifting of the radialis graft. First measure the size of the graft. This is measured at 16 x 8 cm. Then mark the graft in the area of the forearm. The forearm is small and very adipose. Cut around the skin. Then expose the cephalic vein and basilica in the area of the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the venous star with search for the confluence between the superficial and deep venous system. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle from proximal to distal. Exposure of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve, which has two branches, both of which are preserved. Exposure of the radial artery. Clamping of the radial artery under pulsoxymetric control. Ligation of the radial artery. Lifting of the radial artery graft from the tendons and development of the pedicle in the usual manner. Deposition of the stem while preserving the interosseous outlet. A superficial vein and a deep vein can also be lifted while preserving the confluence. Separation of the nerve and suturing of the graft into the defect area. This must largely be done transcervically, as the graft cannot be fitted transorally due to the adipose conditions. For this purpose, sutures are placed in the area of the vallecula and the graft is pulled in secondarily. In the area of the soft palate and the tip of the tongue, suturing is continued transorally. In some cases, the graft must be fixed around the teeth. Ultimately, the graft fits well. Then the anastomosis is applied. Suturing of the arterial anastomosis. This succeeds without any problems. Then anastomosis of the two veins. The facial vein and a branch from the facial vein are used here. This creates good pedicle pulsation, which results in good graft perfusion. Insertion of 2 Redon drains and two-layer wound closure on both sides of the neck. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Postoperative flap control according to the usual schedule.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy

The tumor is successively removed under vision with a safety margin of about 1 cm, ultimately resulting in a hemiglossectomy. Macroscopically and palpatorily, there are no more tumor extensions. When inspecting the specimen, the safety margin in the area of the anterior floor of the mouth is 1 to 3 mm smaller than in the other direction. Therefore, a resection is taken in the area of the anterior floor of the mouth. Subsequently, marginal sections are taken from the entire circumference as well as from the base of the tumor, all of which prove to be free of tumor except for the posterior tumor base. Therefore, in the course of the operation, a large piece of the tongue is resected again in the affected area and then another peripheral incision is taken. Both samples were found to be tumor-free on frozen section histology, so that an R0 resection can now be assumed. This results in an approx. 8 x 8.5 x 5.5 large area to be reconstructed. Subsequent transition to elevation of the radial flap graft from the left forearm. Mark the S-shaped skin incision and the radialis flap to be removed while protecting the retinaculum. Sharply cut through the skin and the subcutis. Push the two muscle bellies apart and expose the very strong vascular pedicle in depth. This is dissected proximally, where a strong cubital vein star is found. In addition, 2 large-lumen veins are dissected, which will later be used for anastomosis. Expose the origin of the radial artery. Then develop the flap distally. Here, after incision on the ulnar side, the flap is developed subfascially from here to the tendon. The radial side of the flap is then also developed, sparing the sensitive radial branch. The flap is now fully developed and is left in situ until both neck dissections have been completed. Once the tumor has been resected, the neck is dissected on the right side through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> simultaneously with the radial flap elevation on the left forearm. First, make an arcuate incision from the mastoid over the sternocleidomastoid muscle and curved anteriorly back towards the chin. Then dissection through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. The platysma is then further dissected upwards subplatysmally. The cervical anus is spared. However, this must be sacrificed later. Sparing of a vein running far anteriorly as a possible vascular connection later. Dissection of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the posterior digaster venter muscle. Then start with the lateral neck dissection. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and the accessorius nerve. At least 3 to 4 clear metastases can be seen. Removal of the upper neck specimen from level II b. Sparing of numerous accessorius branches. Dissection further caudally. Protection of the plexus branches. Then complete removal of the lateral neck preparation. Subsequent removal of the anterior neck preparation including level I a, i.e. subcutaneous tissue with lymph nodes up to the opposite left digaster venter anterior muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the vessels leading to the submandibular gland. Subsequent sharp exposure of nerve branches that run from the lingual nerve to the gland. Ligation of the Wharton's duct and complete removal of the gland. Then clearing of level II with at least one suspicious lymph node below the mandible. Subsequent preparation of possible connecting vessels for the radial artery flap, including the superior thyroid artery. Subsequently handover of the operation to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The undersigned <CLINICIAN_NAME> then also performs the neck dissection on the left side. Here too, lymph node regions I to V are successively removed. There are clinical signs of metastasis in almost all regions. The jugular vein is not thrombosed, but in the middle section in the region of region III it is somewhat weak in caliber, otherwise freely pervious. Dissection of the superior thyroid artery, which will later serve as an anastomosis. There is no facial vein as such, nor is there a large-volume inflow to the internal jugular vein, so that an end-to-side anastomosis will be performed for microvascular venous anastomosis. The radial artery flap graft is then harvested from the left forearm. This is pulled through the access created in the floor of the mouth to the left side of the neck and sutured into the area of the defect. The flap is then microvascularly anastomosed, whereby the radial artery is connected to the superior thyroid artery. The venous anastomosis was performed directly to the internal jugular vein in the end-to-side anastomosis. At the final check, the anastomoses are freely patency. In addition, the stalk is loosely fixed to the surrounding muscle tissue with 2 Vicryl sutures. Insertion of a Redon suction drain and a flap. Suturing of the two neck dissection incisions on the neck. Subsequent removal of an 8 x 5 cm split-thickness skin graft from the right thigh by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The defect in the area of the left forearm is treated with this split-thickness skin. Finally, perform the tracheotomy of the visor. After sharp transection of the cutis and the subcutaneous fatty tissue, the prelaryngeal musculature in the linea alba is pushed apart. After dissection, the thyroid isthmus is clamped off on the pretracheal lamina, cut off and pushed to the side. The trachea is then opened between the 3rd and 4th tracheal clasps. Completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis and easy insertion of an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube, onto which the patient is then intubated. Finally, the arm and thigh dressing is applied. Sterile wound dressing in the neck area. End of the operation and handover of the patient to anesthesia. Addendum: Macroscopically, there was evidence of clinical metastasis on both sides of the cervix, so that adjuvant radiochemotherapy will be indicated subsequently.","Glossectomy, Neck dissection, Tracheostomy, Flap

The tumor extends from the tonsil lobe in a cone shape along the lateral pharyngeal wall caudally, passes over to the caudal base of the tongue and takes up about 1/4 of the tongue base growing superficially until it finally passes over to the dorsal floor of the mouth, glossotonsillar groove, mandibular angulus and the soft palate. Here the tumor extends to the parauvular region, where the resection is completed accordingly. The entire specimen is sent for frozen section assessment after marking the wound edges accordingly. Meanwhile, start the left neck dissection: To do this, make a skin incision along a cervical skin fold in the direction of the mastoid. Dissection of cranial and caudal platysmal flaps and exposure of the internal jugular vein and the auricular nerve. While the nerve can be spared, the vein ultimately lies across the situs so that it must be ligated as cranially as possible. Further dissection along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and exposure of the vascular nerve sheath. Dissection along the omohyoid muscle to the hyoid bone and along the digastric muscle to complete neck dissection level II to IV. Careful elevation of the neck block. A macroscopic metastasis is found in the area of level IIb. Here the accessory nerve passes through one of the two macroscopically conspicuous lymph nodes so that it must be resected. Otherwise, spare all vascular and nerve structures. Subsequently, careful evacuation of level V up to above the cervical plexus. Finally, lateral pharyngotomy after evacuation of level I, taking the submandibular gland with it. This was already visible enorally in the sense of the wound bed. As the frozen section diagnostics that had been performed in the meantime had described an R1 situation in the basal part, among others, this part was completely removed in the sense of a thorough resection. The facial and lingual arteries were ligated. The hypoglossal nerve, however, can be spared. Wide opening of the pharynx to the enoral defect. Neck dissection now follows on the right side by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and parallel to this the elevation of the forearm graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Transition to neck dissection on the right side. Mark the course of the mandible and the ascending mandibular branch as well as the mastoid. Create a curved skin incision extending laterally in the area of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sharp dissection of the subcutaneous fatty tissue and the platysma. Subsequent subplatysmal dissection. Subsequent exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and exposure of the omohyoid muscle as the caudal border. Subsequent dissection of the omohyoid muscle up to the hyoid. Subsequent dissection and visualization of the posterior surface of the sternocleidomastoid and the course of the accessorius nerve. Then move on to exposing the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle as the cranial border. Also exposure and intraoperative protection of the hypoglossal nerve. Beginning of exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the internal jugular vein and the facial vein in its entire course up to the cranial border. The external jugular vein was cut off intraoperatively for reasons of clarity. The course of the common carotid artery was then exposed. After exposure of all the above-mentioned landmarks, the medial and lateral neck specimens are removed after successive dissection. On the right side, apart from the external jugular vein, all large branches of the external jugular vein and external carotid artery were preserved. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation and wound irrigation with Ringer's solution. Subsequent placement of a 10-gauge Redondra ring and two-layer wound closure. This results in a functional neck dissection on the right side in regions II, III and IV. The findings are then demonstrated <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Meanwhile, elevation of the forearm graft. For this purpose, draw the graft with a size of approx. 10 x 5 cm, taking into account the exact anatomy, so that the width is drawn variably. A skin monitor is integrated into the drawing for postoperative monitoring of the graft. Careful elevation of the graft, taking the cephalic vein with it. Separation of the radial vascular pedicle after appropriate preparation and elevation from distal to proximal into the crook of the elbow. Here the confluence of the superficial and deep venous system is sought out and identified as well as the outlet of the radial artery from the ulnar artery. Appropriate ligatures and removal of the vascular pedicle. Beforehand, the tourniquet (300 mmHg) is opened and careful hemostasis is performed. The lifted graft is now retracted from cervical to enoral and carefully incorporated using appropriate single-button Vicryl sutures (3.0). This results in complete coverage of the defect and satisfactory reconstruction of the oropharyngeal region. Parallel to the incorporation, full-thickness skin is lifted from the right groin and the lifting defect on the right forearm is treated with full-thickness skin and continuous suturing. Application of a vacuum dressing, which should be left in place for 7 days. Splinting of the arm with special attention to finger fixation. Meanwhile cervical vascular sutures. The superior thyroid artery is connected to the radial artery in the sense of an end-to-end anastomosis. The excellent flow of the superior thyroid artery is checked beforehand. After appropriate demonstration of good venous return, the flap vein is now connected to a branch of the facial vein using a size 2.5 coupler in the sense of an end-to-end anastomosis. To stabilize the curved course of the venous vessel and to prevent kinking, a small gelatin sponge is inserted into the curvature. The vascular monitor is now positioned correctly to stabilize the flap pedicle and incorporated into the neck skin. Subcutaneous sutures and skin suture. On the right side, insertion of a 10 mm Redon drain and also subcutaneous and skin sutures. Subsequent tracheostoma placement by <CLINICIAN_NAME> to temporarily secure the airway postoperatively. The stoma can be closed again once sufficient swallowing has been ensured and the swelling has subsided enorally with adequate breathing. The wound in the groin area is primarily treated with subcutaneous sutures and skin sutures. Insertion of an 8-gauge Duracuff cannula with core. This is sutured in place. The sutures should be removed after 5 days. Only then can the cannula be fixed in place with the appropriate tape. Classic monitoring of the transplant for 5 days, according to the applicable regulations and no bandages or tapes in the neck area for at least 5 days. The upper body should be elevated at approx. 45°.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheostomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Recommendation of primary surgical treatment in our interdisciplinary tumor conference. Immediate preoperative confirmation of the sonographic cN2a neck status with clinically prominent mass in level II on the right.","First inspection of the primary tumor region after intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Positioning of the patient. Entry with the tonsillar retractor. Inspection and palpation. The exophytic lesion can be seen in the area of the right tonsil lobe. On palpation, the lesion is submucosal and extending into the soft palate, with infiltration of the posterior palatal arch. Laterally, the mass is still displaceable. In this case, the tonsil capsule is barely exceeded. The tumor is now resected in the sense of a radical tonsillectomy. In the area of the submucosal part of the soft palate, the resection must be carried out as far as the parauvular area and a clear resection of the soft palate. The tumor itself is relatively well encapsulated, but takes up the entire tonsil lobe. Inclusion of the posterior palatal arch muscularly and in the area of the mucosal level. A muscle cuff is also left laterally and the lower tonsil pole is included. In this case, the tumor does not significantly protrude. On the specimen, the specimen is now resected in sano, but with encapsulation basally probably histologically barely in sano resection. Therefore, the tumor is completely covered basally and in the mucosal area by taking marginal samples. These are diagnosed as completely free of tumor and dysplasia in the frozen section diagnostics, so that a reliable R0 situation is present here. Due to the resection down to the soft tissues of the neck and the large area of exposed neck fatty tissue as well as the resection of almost half of the soft palate and resection of the posterior palatal arch, a radialis graft is indicated to cover the defect for the best possible functionality. The PEG tube is initially inserted if the neck status is positive. Insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-transmission into the stomach. If the mucosal conditions here are unremarkable and the diaphanoscopy is good, the stomach is punctured without any problems and the PEG tube is then inserted using the usual thread pull-through method. Neck dissection of the left side is then performed first. Submandibular incision. Separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma for complete exposure of the neck area. Perform a functional neck dissection level II to IV, exposing and protecting the submandibular gland, sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle, internal jugular vein, facial vein, cervical artery, superior thyroid artery, hypoglossal nerve and accessory nerve. Followed by careful wound inspection, wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Turning to the opposite side. Here in level II, a mass measuring approx. 4 cm. First cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma, which is not infiltrated. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. The mass is relatively smoothly encapsulated, no infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Free preparation of the anterior neck specimen, with careful protection of the hypoglossal nerve, superior thyroid artery and facial vein. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. The mass lies on the vein, compresses it, but does not infiltrate it. Similarly, exposure and preservation of the accessorius nerve, which is also only in contact with the mass. There is also no infiltration of the digastric muscle. Complete the neck in level V, carefully preserving the cervical plexus branches. Finally, resection of the digastric muscle and performance of a pharyngotomy and creation of a tunnel measuring approx. 3 transverse fingers enorally for compression-free style positioning. The radialis graft is now removed from the left forearm in a bloodless state. Draw a graft measuring 10 x 5 cm in total with a special soft palate configuration. Trimming of the graft. Radial dissection with the cephalic vein located far dorsally, leaving it intact. Exposure and preservation of the ramus superficialis nervi radialis. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Distal transection of the radial artery. Ulnar preparation. Strictly subfascial preparation and release of the specimen. Isolation on the vascular pedicle. Exposure and preservation of the common interosseous artery. Exposure and dissection of a venous confluence and removal of the excellent vital graft, after reopening of the tourniquet and regular hand perfusion. Subsequent careful wound inspection and hemostasis in the forearm area. Careful wound closure and incorporation of the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the right groin. Subsequent application of the vacuum pump. Application of the Kramer splint in the functional position and repositioning of the arm at the end of the procedure. For full-thickness skin harvesting from the right groin. Incision of a spindle-shaped area of skin measuring 12 x 5 cm in total. Strictly cutaneous lifting. Followed by subcutaneous mobilization. Hemostasis and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, multi-layer wound closure under moderate tension. The radialis graft is then incorporated. Despite the advanced swelling of the tongue, this was sufficient and regular. Good soft palate reconstruction and intact conditions on all sides. Stalk positioning and conditioning of the superior thyroid artery and performance of the arterial anastomosis with 8-0 Ethilon. Subsequently, immediate regular venous return and good graft perfusion. Conditioning of the facial vein and insertion of the venous anastomosis with the size 3.5 coupler, followed by careful irrigation of the wound if the graft circulation is normal and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Subsequently, due to the advanced swelling of the tongue and the extent of the graft, a protective tracheostomy is performed. This involves a circumscribed skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the infrahyoid musculature. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. In the case of protective tracheotomy, only punctual epithelialization. Subsequent problem-free reintubation to a size 8 low-cuff cannula, suture-fixed. The procedure was then completed without complications. Conclusion: Intraoperatively R0 resected cT2 cN2a tonsillar carcinoma on the right. Postoperative meticulous flap monitoring by enoral inspection. If the graft has healed properly, the patient can be gradually built up and decannulated from the 7th to 8th postoperative day. After receiving the definitive histology, presentation at our interdisciplinary tumor conference to determine the adjuvant therapy.","Resection, Neck dissection, Flap coverage (Radial), Tracheotomy, PEG placement

Skeletonization of the hypoglossal nerve again. Exposure of the facial artery up to the exit from the area of the lingofacial trunk. The lingual artery is severed and struck caudally with the facial artery. Now overview of the tumor with defect in the pharyngeal space. Extensive resection of the soft tissue in the caudal margin of the former tumor, whereby the hyoid bone, superior cornu and parts of the external musculature around the hyoid bone are also resected up to the beginning of the vallecula. Subsequently, extensive marginal sampling of the mucosa caudally from the pharyngeal wall over the piriform sinus to the arytenoid region, with soft tissue underneath and with preservation of the superior laryngeal nerve. In addition, extensive soft tissue resection in the area of the vallecula. The latter two go to the frozen section. No more tumor infiltrates, thus R0 situation. Definitive indication for defect coverage using a radial flap. Neck dissection on the right by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Marking of the skin incision in consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Incision of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Incision of the platysma with protection of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve.

Division of the neck preparation from caudal to cranial along the internal jugular vein. Identification of the hypoglossal nerve and the accessorius nerve. The neck preparation (lateral) is detached from the deep cervical fascia from cranial to caudal. Care is taken to spare the branches of the cervical plexus and the accessory nerve. The common carotid artery and the vagus nerve are exposed. All structures can be preserved. Overall, regions Ib to IV are included in the neck preparation. After removal of the lateral preparation, the medial preparation is now prepared and removed. The branches of the external carotid artery can be left intact. Irrigation of the wound with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Overall, the wound is completely dry. Placement of a 10-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure with a platysma and skin suture. Tracheostoma creation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Transition to tracheostomy. A skin incision is made 1.5 QF below the thyroid cartilage. Careful dissection up to the trachea with careful hemostasis. Transverse incision of the trachea between two cartilages while protecting the tracheal tube. The operation is now briefly interrupted to suture in the flap. This is performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequent mobilization of the subcutaneous tissue and mucocutaneous epithelialization by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The radialis flap is now elevated from the left forearm. Mark the size of the flap on the forearm approx. 9 x 6 cm. First cut around the flap from the ulnar side. Extend the incision towards the crook of the elbow. Exposure and preservation of the superficial venous system. Subsequent subfascial elevation of the flap from the radial side. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. Exposure of the radial artery caudally. This is first clamped off. Flap is further elevated subfascially from ulnar and radial. The vascular pedicle is exposed up to the elbow.

The radial artery is then severed and treated using 4.0 Prolene single button sutures using the puncture technique. Hand always well perfused up to this point, saturation at 100 %. Lifting of the flap subfascially. Smaller vessels are ligated or clipped or treated bipolarly. Lift up to the elbow area, here the radial artery and the vein of the deep venous system can be visualized. These are relatively small. However, there are 3 large veins of the superficial venous system, which are connected to the deep venous system. The flap is then removed. Veins are ligated. The brachial artery is supplied by puncture ligation. The flap is then flushed with heparin solution and preserved. Transition to defect coverage with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Marking of the graft. Cut around the graft and make a curved skin incision up to the elbow. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the cephalic vein and the outlets in the superficial system. Visualization of the venous confluence. Exposure of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve, which is spared. Exposure of the radial artery. Separation and transection of the radial artery. Lifting of the radial artery graft from the tendon bed and dissection of the pedicle up to the elbow. Removal of the pedicle while preserving the interosseous artery and the ulnar artery. One vein is lifted from the deep system and two veins from the superficial system. Suturing of the arm in the usual manner with coverage by split skin from the right thigh.

Start suturing in the piriform sinus, then in the vallecula, then on the lateral pharyngeal wall and the last part transorally in the area of the soft palate and the edge of the tongue. The stalk is diverted to the left and connected to the lingual artery and the facial vein, the external jugular vein and another branch from the internal jugular vein. This means that a triple venous anastomosis and a single arterial anastomosis were performed. Insertion of a Redon drainage. Two-layer wound closure. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Antibiotics, which were started intraoperatively with Unacid, should be continued for 1 week. Control of the radial flap in a typical manner for 5 days according to the scheme. Continue herparin perfusor 500 units per hour for 5 days. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube. After 10 days, swallow porridge, then build up diet if necessary. Wait for the final histology and then presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference to plan further adjuvant therapy.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy creation

The surgical procedure was discussed in the tumor conference. The tumor volume is too large for primary radiochemotherapy. The patient had ample opportunity to inform himself about the procedure, was given detailed information and agreed to the operation.","Introductory consultation with the anesthetist. Induction of anesthesia. Transoral intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Entry with the flexible gastroesophagoscope. Pre-viewing into the stomach. If the diaphanoscopy is good, a PEG is placed using the thread pull-through method. Application of a wound dressing. This is done without any problems. Sterile washing and draping. Perform the tracheostomy in the usual way. For this, vertical skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the musculature. Split the muscles in the median line and expose the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus and exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis and transfer to an LE tube. Then positioning of the patient. Sterile draping of all relevant areas. Start with neck dissection on the right: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid and digastric muscles. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein, external jugular vein. Visualization of the internal/external carotid artery, superior thyroid artery, facial artery and lingual artery. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and various branches of the cervical plexus. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and the branches of the cervical plexus in the sense of neurolysis. Clearing of the lymph nodes. There are positive lymph nodes in the level II area, which means that level II to V are cleared. Here too, several suspicious, slightly enlarged lymph nodes in the lower area. Insertion of a Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure bandage. Insertion of a McIvor mouth blocker and inspection of the tumor region. The tumor originates from the left tonsil and spreads to the soft palate on the left side and infiltrates the anterior and posterior palatal arch. The uvula is not affected. However, the tumor extends to the base of the uvula. The tumor extends caudally into the glossotonsillar groove and infiltrates the base of the tongue on the left side. Subsequently, combined transoral-transcervical tumor resection: First cut through the digastric muscle. Removal of the submandibular gland. The duct is ligated. The lingual nerve is initially preserved from the caudal side. The facial artery is exposed up to the top and left intact. Pharyngeal wall is dissected away from the vessels, vessels are dissected away from the pharyngeal wall using vessel loops. The tumor is then resected under internal and external control with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm on all sides. The entire pharyngeal wall is removed. Resection extends cranially including the palatal arch and the soft tissue of the pterygoid muscles up to the hypopharyngeal entrance, laterally up to the alveolar ridge or mandible. The lingual nerve cannot be preserved due to the extent of the tumor and must also be resected. Resection extends forward to the floor of the mouth. The entire specimen is removed and marked with sutures. Additional marginal sample from the soft tissues superior basally. In the frozen section, both tumor and margin sample in healthy tissue. Thus R0 situation. Careful hemostasis. Measurement of the defect. This is approx. 11 x 8 cm. Neck dissection on the left. Skin incision in the usual manner on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Visualization of the omoyhoideus muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Dissection of the facial vein and the superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Removal of the neck preparation II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches and the cervical vessel sheath. Redon drainage. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure bandage. Lifting of the radialis graft on the left forearm. To do this, the graft is first marked. Then the cephalic vein, radial artery and ulnar artery are marked. Incision of the skin. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the cephalic vein and the basilic vein. Exposure of the confluence between the deep and superficial venous system. Visualization of the superficial ramus, radial nerve. Exposure of the radial artery. Ligation and stitching of the radial artery. Separation of the radial artery. Lifting the graft from the tendon bed. Dissection of the pedicle up to the elbow and removal of the graft, leaving several venous outlets and preserving the interosseous artery. Marking of the radial artery. Flushing of the entire graft with heparin solution. Lifting of split skin on the right thigh and defect coverage on the left forearm. Sewing on swabs to establish contact between the split skin and the wound bed. Sterile wound dressing and application of a dorsal forearm splint. Insertion of the graft into the oral cavity and start suturing in the area of the soft palate. The graft fits in well. It lies loosely and is sutured in successively, partly around the teeth in the area of the alveolar ridge. In the base of the tongue, transoral suturing is not possible. Here, suturing must be continued transcervically. This is somewhat complicated due to the lack of visibility and swelling of the tongue. Finally, the graft can be sutured in completely. Finally, the oral cavity and pharynx area is filled with Ringer's solution. There is no secretion flowing into the neck area. Dissection of the facial vein, the external jugular vein and the superior thyroid artery as connecting vessels. In addition, an outlet is prepared on the facial artery for a third vein. Anastomosis of the arterial vessels and ultimately also the venous vessels. Unfortunately, even if venous return is initially very good, arterial perfusion still stops intraoperatively. The arterial anastomosis must therefore be reopened and it becomes apparent that an occlusion has occurred in the anastomosis area due to previous damage to the superior thyroid artery. The thyroid artery must be cut back until there is no longer so much arteriosclerotic plaque material in the vessel. However, there is also previous damage here and the arterial anastomosis must again be performed very carefully. The graft is now permanently well perfused and a Redon drain is inserted. Two-layer wound closure. Final consultation with the anesthetist. The patient is ventilated in the intensive care unit and should receive antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Usual flap checks.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheostomy creation, PEG placement, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

A CT scan showed a herniated thyroid cartilage or herniation into the left laryngeal skeleton, therefore the above-mentioned operation was indicated.","First, laryngoscopy and pharyngoscopy again: The exophytic tumor is seen, which is located in the piriform sinus on the left, passes to the vallecula of the epiglottis and also grows into the larynx via the arytenoid fold. Transition also to the postcricoid region. Indication for surgery thus confirmed. Skin disinfection, injection of a total of 20 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline in the area of the sides of the neck and sterile draping of all surgical areas. First, create an apron flap in the typical manner, subplatysmal to the level of the hyoid bone and submandibular gland. Then neck dissection on both sides, initially on the right: same procedure on both sides. Dissection of the lymph node packages from the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. The lymph nodes are then removed from 2 to 5, followed by neck dissection on the left side in the same way. All structures are exposed and preserved as on the opposite side, including the superior thyroid artery. This is followed by laryngectomy with subtotal pharyngectomy: skeletonization of the larynx. Dissection of the suprahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone, which is removed due to the height of the tumor. Skeletonization of the grand......... on the right side and as far as possible on the left side. On the right, the constrictor pharyngeus is dissected from the laryngeal skeleton. This must be largely omitted on the left side, where the constrictor muscles are largely resected as well. Also resection of infrahyoid muscles and lymph nodes up to level VI. Entry into the larynx from the cranial paramedian on the right. Release of the epiglottis, exposure of the tumor. The tumor was previously operated on transorally from the cranial side and the cranial resection margin was marked. A marginal sample from the cranial resection area was in healthy tissue. The tumor is now resected on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1.5 to 2 cm, taking into account the cranial resection margins. Pharynx falls largely to the posterior wall on the left. The postcricoid region is also resected up to just in front of the esophageal entrance. The trachea had already been exposed previously. The lobes of the thyroid gland were clamped, severed and treated with puncture ligatures. The thyroid gland was pushed off caudo-laterally. The larynx was then removed, leaving the trachea extended cranially and dorsally. Then mark the laryngectomy and pharyngectomy specimen. A relatively wide marginal sample is taken from the left pharyngeal wall area and a marginal sample from the tongue base area. However, with free tumor margins around the tumor specimen, the margin sample, which was also taken from the pharyngeal wall area, still shows carcinoma in situ. This indicates discontinuous growth. The marginal sample from the base of the tongue was clear. Further resection in the entire pharyngeal wall area from caudal to cranial left. Removal of a representative marginal sample. This still shows moderate dysplasia. Thus overall R0 situation. No evidence of invasive carcinoma. A 2-4 cm strip of residual pharynx remains. Defect coverage using a radial flap is therefore necessary. The radial flap is removed from the left forearm. Mark the size of the flap, which is 15 x 8-9 cm. Create a tourniquet. Then lift the flap first from the ulnar side, from here extend the incision in the crook of the elbow. Subsequent mobilization of the flap from the radial side, including the superficial venous system and underneath the fascia. Exposure of the vascular pedicle below the brachioradialis muscle. Mobilization of the flap from below after the radial artery, which is supplied with blood by means of a tourniquet, has been removed. Successive elevation of the flap with clipping or bipolar supply of branches. The connection between the deep and superficial venous system is shown in the crook of the elbow. A total of 3 venous connections of the confluence or cephalic vein can be visualized. Good perfusion after opening the tourniquet. Flap remains in perfusion until the R0 situation is established. Then remove the flap. Ligatures in the area of the veins and puncture ligature with 4-0 prolene in the area of the artery shortly before entering the brachial artery. Remaining hand well perfused. Flap is flushed with heparin and preserved. A piece of full-thickness skin of the appropriate size is removed from the groin area in the typical manner. Here a groin after skin mobilization. Closure in layers using multi-layered subcutaneous sutures and back-stitch skin sutures after insertion of a Redon drain with relatively little tension. The forearm wound is closed in layers in the cranial area in a typical manner. The defect is now covered by the full-thickness skin graft and the full-thickness skin graft is successively incorporated here using 4-0 Ethilon sutures. A Hydrogel-Mebilex dressing is then applied. Application of loose compresses. Wrapping in absorbent cotton. Fitting of a Cramer splint and wrapping of the arm with an elastic bandage. Then cover the defect with a radial flap: Radialis flap is inserted into the defect and successively incorporated using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Complete tension-free closure. Flap pedicle is transferred to the right side. After conditioning the vessels, first anastomosis of the radial artery with the superior thyroid artery using 8-0 Ehtilon single button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and good venous return. The vein is confluent with the radial vein and is anastomosed with an outlet from the facial vein using a 2.5 mm coupler; good venous return also after opening the clamps. After conditioning, the cephalic vein is anastomosed with the external jugular vein using a 2.5 mm coupler; good venous flow can also be registered here. The residual veins are clipped and bipolized. Careful irrigation of the surgical site and hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain on both sides. Particularly deep fixation on the right in the anastomosis region. Trachea is epithelized in a typical manner. Finally, insertion of a 10 mm tracheal cannula which is fixed with sutures. No dressing. Patient goes to intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue intraoperative therapy with heparin 500 E/hour for 5 days. Flap control by means of Doppler and clinically via laryngoscope insertion according to scheme. Please continue antibiotic therapy with Unacid, which was started intraoperatively, for at least 2 days. Nutrition via the previously inserted PEG tube for at least 10 days.

PEG insertion first: The esophagoscope is inserted into the stomach without any problems. Inconspicuous conditions there. Good diaphanoscopy. Insertion of the PEG using the thread pull-through method in the usual way without complications. Now adjustment of the laryngeal entrance and the epiglottis with the spreading laryngoscope. A tumor can be seen on the laryngeal epiglottis, which, as described above, touches the aryepiglottic fold on the right, extends to the arytenoid cartilage and infiltrates into the pocket fold.

First of all, cutting around the entire epiglottis with the laser and partial resection of the upper and cranial part of the tumor. Resection anteriorly up to the pre-epiglottic fatty tissue. Splitting of the epiglottis attachment in the area of the petiolus and initial removal and resection of the tumor in the left larynx, up to the pocket crease, into the anterior commissure and into the pre-epiglottic fatty tissue. Resection clinically in healthy tissue. After resection of this part, incision of the aryepiglottic fold and insertion into the larynx. Resection of the entire pocket fold. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage and resection up to the vocal fold. The lower part of the vocal fold remains completely intact up to the anterior commissure at the transition to the left pocket fold. Finally, resection in the area of the right arytenoid.

Circular margin samples are now taken, all of which are found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. An R0 resection can be assumed. Extensive hemostasis during the operation with repeated monopolar and bipolar coagulation. Finally, insertion of a swab with H2O2. This is removed again at the end of the operation. Repositioning of the patient and neck dissection with tracheotomy. Tumor resection was performed (previous procedure by <CLINICIAN_NAME>) Takeover now for neck dissection on both sides. Beginning on the right side: An existing old scar can be seen in the area of the larynx. This is also used for the incision. Therefore, an atypical incision is made here in order to take the old scar structure with it. Dissect down to the sternocleidomastoid. Locate the omohyoid muscle and digaster muscle as the upper and lower structure. Locate the accessorius nerve. Dissecting along the vein. Locating the vagus nerve. Removal of the lateral neck preparation. Now remove the medial neck preparation including the submandibular capsule. Locate and protect the hypoglossal nerve. Irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer. Insertion of a Redon drainage. Subcutaneous suture. Skin suture. Summary: Several suspicious lymph nodes, especially in region III. Now repositioning and start on the left side: Here now slightly similar incision as on the right in the area of the tension lines in order to maintain symmetry. Dissect down to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissect down to the omohyoid and digaster. Locate the accessorius nerve. It can now be seen that the bulb of the carotid artery is located laterally, the vagus nerve is on the outside and the vein itself is located medially as a normal variant. Locate the hypoglossal nerve. This is also prominently exposed. The lateral neck preparation is now dissected out, possibly sparing the plexus branches, as on the right side. The medial parts of the neck and the submandibular capsule are also removed. Followed by hydrogen irrigation, Ringer irrigation. Insertion of a Redon drainage. Subcutaneous suture. Skin suture. Regio III/IV enlarged nodes also appeared on the left side. Now repositioning and tracheotomy: Kocher collar incision. Dissection down to the thyroid gland. Undermining of the same. Passing through the isthmus, repositioning. Formation of a Björk flap after entering the trachea. Suturing it to the skin. Skin suture. Then reintubation with an 8-gauge cannula. Now inspection of the laryngeal resection margin: Small hemorrhage in the anterior and lateral part. These are monopolar coagulated. No more bleeding afterwards.

The resection extends to the base of the uvula on the right side and also includes the posterior palatal arch, so that the possibility of the patient regurgitating during spontaneous healing cannot be ruled out with certainty. For this reason, no further measures at this time. First wait for the clinical course. Should regurgitation occur, a radial flap would be indicated, so that exploration of the right neck is not carried out at the present time. Initially reconstruction of the posterior palatal arch with parts of the uvula. Suturing of the uvula with its base to the right, resulting in closure of the nasopharynx in the functional sense. Due to the large wound bed, tracheotomy is now indicated. Local anesthesia is placed below the larynx. Abjode and cover the surgical site. Incision. Exposure of the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the linea alba, the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus after appropriate ligation. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Entering the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring and creating a small tracheostoma. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma and reintubation of the patient. Final inspection of the wound conditions in the mouth area. Dry conditions here. Insertion of a feeding tube. Final consultation with the anesthetist.","Tumor-tonsillectomy, Tracheotomy

Subsequent inspection of the oral cavity after suturing the tip of the tongue. The previously described exophytic process of the posterior edge of the tongue on the right with transition to the right tongue base, the glossotonsillar groove or the lower tonsillar pole on the right is seen. Demonstration of the findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and determination of the resection margins. On palpation, the tumor extends into the base of the tongue with a cone, but is superficial towards the tip of the tongue or the anterior edge of the tongue. Now dissect the tumor with sufficient safety distance using bipolar coagulation and scissors from anterior to posterior. The tumor cone described above can be seen in the base of the tongue, resulting in a deeper resection in the sense of a one-third resection of the base of the tongue. In addition, the suspicious mucosal area towards the oropharyngeal side wall or tonsil is resected in the sense of a tumor tonsillectomy after further consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME> with a sufficient macroscopic safety margin. Hemostasis with bipolar coagulation and H202. Subsequent removal of circular margin samples, anterior tongue margin, lower tongue margin, upper tongue margin, tongue base and pharyngeal wall. These are all found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. It can therefore be assumed that the resection was R0 on the basis of markoscopy and microscopy. Now demonstration of the findings and discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Indication for level I to V neck dissection on the right and level II to V on the left. Start with neck dissection on the right: repositioning of the patient, infiltration anesthesia and skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle with an auxiliary submental incision. Dissection through subcutaneous tissue and platysma, on the sternocleidomastoid muscle in depth. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle, the prelaryngeal musculature, the internal jugular vein in its course, the facial vein, the common carotid artery with division into external and internal. The accessorius nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, the deep cervical artery and the branches of the cervicobrachial plexus, these structures are all spared and the lateral neck preparation is now cleared out caudally starting at the accessorius triangle. Several enlarged nodes can be seen. There is also a nodule in the medial neck preparation, here appearing suspiciously in the vein angle. Clearing of the medial neck preparation and further preparation with removal of the capsule of the submandibular gland anteriorly and submentally, here clearing of the fatty tissue, but no suspicious findings on palpation. Overall clinical findings of cN1 status on the right. Then turn to the left side. Here too, skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. After infiltration anesthesia, dissection in depth, exposing the structures mentioned on the right side. Here too, protection of the same and dissection of the median and lateral neck preparation. Finally, hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. H202 and ring irrigation as well as repeated demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> if the surgical site is free of bleeding. Insertion of a Redon drain and two-layer wound closure and wound dressing. Finally, re-inspection of the oral cavity, here no further bleeding and adaptation sutures in the area of the right edge of the tongue up to the base of the tongue.

The patient now presents with a histologically confirmed carcinoma in situ (grade III intraepithelial neoplasia). Endoscopy revealed a very uneven mucosa, raised above the normal mucosal level, primarily affecting the left pocket fold. Therefore indication for the above mentioned operation.","After induction of anesthesia, tracheoscopy is first performed with 0 degree optics. This reveals a subglottic protrusion of a tracheal cartilage with a slight narrowing of the tracheal lumen by approx. 20 %. However, the mucosa is not irritated. Now orotracheal intubation by the surgeon. Then proceed to flexible esophagogastroscopy. Mucosal conditions are normal on all sides, even in the cardia area after inversion and in the pylorus area. No further abnormalities of the esophagus when the endoscope is withdrawn. Now proceed to panendoscopy. Apart from the tumor described below, there are no other abnormalities in the entire oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and laryngeal region. The tumor itself is a clearly uneven mucosal region with elevation and a slightly exophytic aspect in the area of the left pocket fold, which also affects the upper side of the left vocal fold in its central area via the morgue sinus. The anterior region and also the anterior commissure are tumor-free. The free aryepiglottic fold is not affected, but the tumor grows over into the ary region in the posterior part of the pocket fold and the vocal fold also appears relatively unsteady in the area of the vocal process. Now repeated consultation of <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>, which ultimately indicated the performance of laser resection with frozen section examinations. The anterior section is now set to 3 watt continuous mode with the CO2 laser and the left pocket fold is resected. The anterior part of the left vocal fold is then also resected with the laser in its upper part up to the free edge. The vocal cord can be preserved if the findings are relatively superficial, as can the vocalis muscle. Now setting the posterior side. Here the resection extends over the pocket fold to the free aryepiglottic fold and then medially over the arytenoid cartilage almost to the interary region without entering it. Here, too, the findings are clearly superficial and the arytenoid cartilage itself can be preserved. Now, although there is no clinical suspicion that the mass is extending into the depths, the wound bed is resected again in the supraglottic area corresponding to the pocket crease, because the CT suggests that the tumor is deeper in this area. In between, repeated coagulation with the forceps and monopolar coagulation. Finally, frozen section diagnostics are performed. Six frozen sections are taken from the free edge of the glottis via the arytenoid region, in the wound bed along the pocket crease, again in the anterior pocket crease and in the anterior commissure area. All frozen sections were found to be tumor-free. Only the arytenoid region is removed with slight dysplasia. For this reason, a small strip is recut in this area. In between, careful hemostasis with placement of supra-swabs. Placement of a feeding tube, which should be left in place for 7 days. Intraoperative administration of 3 g Unacid, which should be continued for 24 hours, and 250 mg SDH single-shot. Conclusion: cT2 ycN0 supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma with involvement of the morgue sinus and vocal fold on the left side. R0 resection in the frozen section. Further procedure after receipt of the final histology, whereby it should be discussed in the tumor conference whether a new neck dissection can be dispensed with in the case of ycN0 neck status and pre-treatment of the patient.","Transoral laser resection, Panendoscopy

After induction of anesthesia, a new pharyngo-laryngoscopy is performed, confirming the findings of the preliminary examination. Comparison with the CT findings. It was found that the tumor was relatively well encapsulated, a cN0 situation was present, therefore now after esophagogastroscopy with good diaphanoscopy and insertion of the troicart. After alcohol disinfection, infiltration anesthesia, placement of the PEG tube in the typical manner and subsequent insertion of the tonsil plug. The overview is poor with restricted mouth opening, especially of the caudal part, so that the combined transoral, transcervical approach is preferred. Reposition the patient for this. Alcohol disinfection. Infiltration anesthesia and preforming of a platysmal flap. To do this, first make a skin incision into the subcutaneous tissue. Cut around the suspected defect in the supraclavicular area, lift off the skin laterally and medially of the neck incision above the platysma. Expose the platysma at the level of the clavicle. Separation of the same. Here and fixation sutures skin platysma. Then carefully dissect cranially, taking the platysma and the surrounding connective tissue structures up to the capsule of the submandibular gland and preserving the facial artery and vein. Now expose the cervical vascular sheath, expose the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve as well as the accessorius nerve. Clearing out the lateral neck preparation from the omohyoid to the digaster, sparing the aforementioned structures and the main plexus branches. Exposure of the medial neck preparation and removal of the same, including the capsule of the submandibular gland and preservation of the other structures mentioned, including the artery and superior vein. Now dissect the ventral part of the digastric muscle and the styloid muscle. Dissection of the same. Counterpalpation of oral and cervical. The smoothly bordered tumor can be seen and that when entering the pharynx one emerges just caudal to the hypoglossus below the tumor. Therefore, re-insertion of the tonsil stop, cutting around the tumor from the cranial side, including the anterior palatal arch, parts of the soft palate and the lateral pharyngeal wall up to the alveolar ridge. Dissection clearly macroscopically in healthy tissue, including muscle layers on the tumor. Now dissect caudally as far as this is possible without complications, then open the pharynx below the tumor and cut around the caudal parts of the tumor under visual control. Development of the complete tumor specimen which is sent for final histology. Forming a resection in the area cranial to the entrance to the operation, as submucosal growth could not be ruled out by palpation. Subsequently, representative marginal samples are taken circularly. All of these, including the tongue margin sample, were found to be tumor-free by <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the pathology department, so that a safe R0 resection can be assumed. After careful hemostasis and wound irrigation, the caudal pharyngeal opening is widened so that the flap stalk is not trapped; the lingual artery is cut and severed for this purpose. The flap is then swung into the defect; this is achieved without tension up to the upper palatal arch, where the flap is adapted to the mucosal borders and the posterior palatal arch. The uvula remains freely movable. Adaptation to the caudal side. Now turn towards the transverical and reduce the pharyngeal access. Then suture the accompanying connective and fatty tissue of the flap pedicle with the pharyngeal musculature to create a complete closure. Finally, insertion of a Redon drainage and two-layer wound closure by forming a Burrow triangle can achieve complete primary closure. Please apply a pressure dressing to the lower third of the neck scar, never to the cranial third. If problems occur, the lateral part of the flap can be primarily released from the suture and sutured again secondarily.","Tumor tonsillectomy on the right, Right neck dissection, Pharyngeal reconstruction, Pedicled flap (Platysma), PEG placement, Endoscopy

A coarse, exophytic tumor is seen at the upper pole of the tonsil, which grows laterally and includes the upper tonsil. The posterior and anterior palatal arch are only partially infiltrated. Demonstration on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who alternately resect this tumor. The tumor is thread-marked for frozen section. The pathologist determines an R0 situation. The lateral pharyngeal muscles on the right side are still sufficiently intact, so the decision is made to perform a neck dissection on both sides. Initially start on the left side. Skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Creation of a platysma flap cranially. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid and omohyoid muscles. Exposure of the nervus accessorius and the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein and removal of the neck block II a to V a, sparing the plexus branches. With the exception of the external jugular vein, all structures can be preserved. Switch to the opposite side. Here you can already feel a rough swelling and an immobile sternocleidomastoid muscle from the outside. Skin incision in the usual manner. Depiction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the caudal region. In the cranial region, the tumor can just be detached from the platysma, but no longer from the sternocleidomastoid muscle. It was therefore decided to remove the muscle in the lower part, cut through the sternocleidomastoid muscle and expose the cervical sheath. Detachment of the neck preparation from level V a cranially, in the area of the internal jugular vein/ facial vein angle, the metastasis cannot be detached from the internal jugular vein, so the decision is made to detach the vein in front of it. Detachment of the metastasis including the neck block. In the upper part, first expose and ligate the internal jugular vein at the base of the skull. Detachment of the neck block with the metastasis while sparing the internal and external carotid artery. The internal carotid artery has a pronounced kinking in the upper area, but can be completely spared; the hypoglossal nerve can also be completely spared. The upper part of the cervical plexus branches must also be removed as well as the accessorius nerve. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation and insertion of drains and double wound closure on both sides. Performance of the tracheotomy by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. (<CLINICIAN_NAME>) First palpation of the thyroid and cricoid cartilage, horizontal skin incision at the level of the cricoid cartilage and dissection in depth under palpatory control up to the thyroid gland.

Then enter the larynx in the area of the epiglottis. The area of the lingual epiglottis mucosa is spared as far as possible. Then successive release of the larynx with maximum preservation of the pharyngeal mucosa. Separate the laryngeal skeleton from the pharyngeal tube up to the beginning of the trachea. Here the larynx is set down in a typical manner. In the case of subglottic growth, creation of the tracheostoma in the typical manner. Larynx is sent in for frozen section, here in frozen section cranial and caudal in the area of the mucosal settling points or trachea and epiglottis in sano. Subsequently, myotomy on the left side in the typical manner. The muscles of the pharyngeal tube are severed. Then separation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the area of the medial insertions on both sides. Then insertion of a 10 mm Provox prosthesis in the typical manner. This is positioned correctly. Then closure of the pharynx in a single layer using single button sutures. Further inverted suture in the second layer. Suturing of the pharyngeal tube or constrictor pharyngis and suprahyoidal muscles cranially, also using single Vicryl 3-0 button sutures. Then irrigation and careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of Redon drainage on both sides and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Subsequent completion of the procedure without complications. Overall cT3-4 carcinoma endolaryngeal. Due to questionable cartilage infiltration to the front and the overall extension, laryngectomy was performed with neck dissection on both sides.

Caudal resection of parts of the base of the tongue is carried out here at a clear distance. The beginning of the posterior wall of the hypopharynx and posterior wall of the oropharynx is also resected. Due to the growth at one point in depth in the direction of the submandibular gland, the tumor is then resected from the transcervical side as part of the neck dissection. After cutting the digastric muscle, the submandibular gland is mobilized. The hypoglossal nerve is exposed and spared for this purpose. The lingual nerve was already severed during the resection from the enoral side, as it runs too close to the tumor or was infiltrated by the tumor. Glandula submandibularis is now pushed into the oral cavity en bloc with the tumor and attached soft tissue. It can be seen that the tumor was resected macroscopically with a wide safety margin on all sides. Nevertheless, another marginal sample was taken at the alveolar ridge extending to the glossotonsillar groove. Tumor is marked with a thread and sent for frozen section together with the marginal sample. The frozen section shows carcinoma in situ on all sides, partly with transition to microcarcinoma, only in the area of the posterior palatal arch there is no carcinoma in situ. A large strip of mucosa is now removed from the alveolar ridge, whereby the mucosa is removed down to the alveoli. In addition, a large resectate is removed from the caudal pharyngeal wall, as well as a wide resectate from the pharyngeal entrance, vallecula area to the base of the tongue. All resected specimens are sent for re-examination as frozen sections, with the sutures placed away from the tumor. Carcinoma in situ again in almost all specimens. After consultation with the pathologists, this appears to be a field carcinoma. Therefore, only the specimen in the caudal pharyngeal region appears to be free of tumor and no carcinoma in situ is detectable. This is followed by a final marginal sample from the vallecula/base of tongue area, where the sutures are again placed away from the tumor. However, this is no longer a frozen section examination but a final examination. It is no longer possible to take a mucosal sample from the alveolar ridge, as the resection has already reached the beginning of the alveolus. The mucosa is healthy towards the floor of the mouth. R1 affected areas are therefore the dorsal alveolar ridge and the base of the tongue/valley area. Overall tendency towards field carcinomatization after consultation with the pathologist. Neck dissection on the left side (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Injection of 10 ml ultracaine solution, making a skin incision from the mastoid at the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid caudally with a slight swing laterally. Expose the platysma. Create a platysma flap anteriorly, expose the sternocleidomastoid. Mobilization of the muscle, sharp dissection in depth up to the plexus branches. The cranial accessorius nerve is exposed. Now follow and mobilize the omohyoid muscle and expose the substructure of the submandibular gland. The gland is now pulled upwards until the digaster muscle is exposed. Exposure of the digaster muscle. Now insert a retractor in the caudal region. Expose the internal jugular vein. Dissect the vein from caudal to cranial, follow the outlets anteriorly, coagulate a small outlet. Now mobilize the neck preparation in level II in the anterior triangle, exposing the hypoglossal nerve and the facial artery. There is bleeding from a small branch of the facial artery, which is ligated. Separation of the anterior triangle up to the omohyoid muscle. Now evacuate level IIa. Pass the neck preparation under the accessorius and dissect caudally via levels III and IV, sparing the plexus branches of the vagus nerve and the internal carotid artery, which is exposed. Finally, check for bloodlessness, which is present. Insertion of a Redon drainage and two-layer wound closure. At the same time, the radial artery graft is lifted from the arm. The extent of the visible tumor was measured to be 8 x 6 cm. A buffer with a final graft size of 12 x 8 cm is also lifted from the forearm. For this purpose, the graft is marked, the graft is cut around and the skin is incised in the proximal forearm area. Exposure of the vein star. The second concomitant vein of the flap stalk has no contact with the superficial system or the venous confluence. The first concomitant vein opens into the venous confluence. Then lift the radialis graft, exposing the brachioradialis muscle of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve, the radial artery and lift the graft from the tendon bed and dissect the pedicle in the usual manner. Deposition of the graft in the usual manner and closure of the forearm with split skin from the thigh. The frozen section still showed carcinoma in situ with microinvasion in the marginal samples, therefore <CLINICIAN_NAME> resected 3 more times and the 2nd resection also showed carcinoma in situ with microinvasion, the third resection was taken in the area of the vallecula and sent for final histology. In the end, the resection significantly enlarged the defect so that the graft could only be sutured in under tension and with difficulty. The anastomosis was then performed using the facial artery. The facial artery is altered like a plaque and the endothelium has already detached over a long distance within the vessel. Therefore, 2 suture attempts were necessary to connect the radial artery with the facial artery. Two veins were couplers, one directly from the concomitant vein with an outlet from the internal jugular vein and then two outlets from the venous confluence with two outlets from the facial vein. At the end, insertion of a Redon drainage (Jackson type) and two-layer wound closure and insertion of an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube. Inspection of the oral cavity and the graft. The graft shows a good blood supply (random sample). Prior to the tumor resection, a PEG was inserted using the thread pull-through method without any problems.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Flap coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy, PEG placement

This is located at the posterior base of the tongue, base of the tongue, glossoalveolar groove and tonsil lobe. Therefore, the above mentioned surgery is indicated. Squamous cell carcinoma G3.","First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The exophytic tumor is seen, which is located at the posterior edge of the tongue, infiltrates the base of the tongue and extends via the glossoalveolar groove into the tonsillar lobe in the anterior region. This confirms the spread of the tumor and the indication for resection, with flap coverage if necessary. This is followed by transoral resection of the tumor, taking into account the macroscopically visible borders and also the palpatorily recognizable borders. Incision around the tumor with a safety margin of 1 to 1.5 cm on all sides. The posterior area of the tongue up to the middle, including the base of the tongue, the mucosa up to the tonsil lobe over the glossotonsillar groove, the anterior area of the palatal arch. The resection extends caudally to the entrance to the hypopharynx. The preparation is thread-marked and sent for frozen section examination. No evidence of tumor in the entire margin of the specimen, even basally, thus R0 resection. Due to the extent of the defect, flap coverage is indicated in any case. The lingual nerve had to be sharply dissected away from the tumor. The PEG is now placed: pre-splinting through the esophagus into the stomach. Here, after establishing spontaneous diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Subsequent repositioning for neck dissection: skin disinfection and injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. Sterile draping. Skin incision first on the left in the typical manner. Depiction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Depiction of the omohyoid muscle. A lymph node conglomerate can be seen cranially, which infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which is therefore also resected cranially. The digastric muscle is also resected as it is also included in the conglomerate. Spatial mass or lymph node conglomerate also infiltrates the internal jugular vein in the cranial region and the accessorius nerve, both of which must be resected. The internal and external carotid arteries as well as the superior thyroid artery, facial artery and lingual artery can be visualized and preserved. The vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve, which can be dissected away from the tumor conglomerate, can also be preserved. This results in the removal of level II to V with exposure of the branches of the cervical plexus. The submandibular gland is also removed. A wide tunnel is then created enorally to allow the pedicle to pass through. Neck dissection on the right side. Skin incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure and ligation of the external jugular vein. Exposure and sparing of the auricular nerve. Exposure of the digaster muscle and the cranial accessorius nerve as well as the caudal omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the capsule of the submandibular gland and the hypoglossal nerve. Subsequent exposure of the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial and complete dissection of the cervical vascular sheath from the multiple suspected metastases in the right anterior neck preparation, particularly in levels II and III. Repeated hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. The multiple cervical metastases on the right side were completely removed while sparing the plexus branches, the accessorius nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. Dry conditions. A complete removal of levels I b, II, III, IV and V was performed, leaving the submandibular gland intact. Wound irrigation with hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Now proceed to tracheotomy: skin incision a total of 5 cm horizontally below the cricoid cartilage and sharp cutting of the skin and subcutaneous tissue using a 15 mm scalpel. Further dissection in depth using pointed scissors. Jugularis anterior is identified, cut and ligated, no bleeding. Now locate the anterior neck muscles and cut through the linea alba. The musculature is pushed to the side. Further dissection in depth with identification of the thyroid gland and thyroid capsule. The isthmus is small, the gland is also relatively small. Bipolar coagulation of the isthmus and transection of the isthmus. Now identification of the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a Björk flap, for which both thyroid lobes are bluntly pushed aside and the trachea is opened using pointed scissors. Targeted bipolar coagulation. Now 3 sutures are placed caudally using Ethibond and 3 sutures cranially to ensure sufficient epithelialization. Suturing is performed without any problems. Skin suture with 4-0 Ethilon, 8-gauge cannula is inserted without any problems. Change of cannula on the 5th postoperative day and suture removal between the 7th and 10th postoperative day. Then elevation of the radial flap from the left forearm: After measuring the defect, a flap, length 10 cm, width 6 ˝ cm, is recorded according to the three-dimensional configuration. Subsequently, first ulnar subfascial elevation of the flap. Then extension of the incision curved into the olecranon. Visualization of the surface vein system with connection to the flap pedicle. Subsequent radial subfascial elevation of the flap. Exposure of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve and preservation of this as far as possible. Caudal exposure of the radial artery, which is first clamped. First expose the pedicle up to the elbow. Dissection of the pedicle also from the brachioradialis muscle distally. Then cut the radial artery and treat it using 4-0 prolene stitches. Hand always supplied with 98-100% blood after clamping of the radial artery. Subsequent lifting of the flap. Outgoing vessels are bipolarly coagulated or clipped. A total of 2 branches of the cephalic vein and a confluent vein as well as the radial artery can be dissected in the crook of the elbow. The flap is then removed. The veins are ligated or clipped. The artery is stitched with 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Flush the flap with heparin solution. The flap is then inserted into the defect and the stalk is passed through the tunnel. Suturing of the flap, initially with sutures. The flap can then be sutured into the ............................... defect, covering the entire area. The facial artery is prepared as a vascular connection. Likewise a vein that emerges from the stump of the internal jugular vein and the external jugular vein. First arterial anastomosis between the facial artery and radial artery. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. After conditioning the veins, a portion of the cephalic vein is first anastomosed with the external jugular vein using a 2.5 mm coupler. After opening the clamps, good venous flow, positive smear phenomenon. The other outgoing vein from the external jugular vein is lipped. The 2nd vein from the cephalic vein is also clipped. The confluence is prepared and anastomosed with the outlet from the internal jugular vein after conditioning the veins using a 2.0 coupler. After opening the clamps, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. Subsequent careful hemostasis and irrigation of the wound area. Wound closure on the right with insertion of a Redon drain on the left and placement of 2 flaps. Insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula and suturing of this. The skin on the forearm is primarily closed cranially and split skin taken from the thigh is sutured caudally. Mepilex is then applied and a loose pressure bandage is applied using absorbent cotton. A Kramer splint is then applied and fixed in place with an elastic bandage. Attachment of the arm. The wound on the thigh is covered with a Mepilex dressing. The procedure is completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics, which were started with Unacid, intraoperatively for 1 week. Please continue heparin perfusor, which was started intraoperatively, at 500 units per hour for 5 days. Check the vitality of the flap clinically and by Doppler. Left cervical suture marking for this purpose. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube for 10 days, then gruel or, if necessary, diet build-up. Overall cT2 to 3 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left with cN2c status.

Starting in the area of the soft palate on the right, an ulcerating, rather flat tumor is seen, which grows on the right side to the parauvular region and consumes the tonsil region. The alveolar ridge is free on palpation. The change extends over the glossotonsillar groove to the tongue, but does not infiltrate it; growth continues caudally over the lateral pharyngeal wall into the piriform sinus entrance. Here, further growth in terms of longitudinal extension, therefore a clear cT3 finding. After partial laryngectomy with residual epiglottis and tilted laryngeal skeleton, otherwise clear conditions. No evidence of laryngeal infiltration. Initially start with transoral resection. Insertion of the McIvor blade. Resection of the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1 ˝ cm. The uvula is removed in the area of the soft palate. Subtotal resection of the soft palate. Removal of the entire tonsil lobe and removal of the glossotonsillar groove. Macroscopically in sano on all sides. No evidence of basal growth in depth. Therefore, enoral sampling in the area of the soft palate and at the buccal margins. These are assessed as tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Now repositioning for transcervical implication of the resection, preoperative ycN0 neck status. Submandibular skin incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous scar plate. Careful and laborious dissection. Exposure of remnants of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Pronounced scarring and blocking. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the common carotid artery. A superior thyroid artery can no longer be visualized. Also anteriorly scarred conditions without residual neck preparation. In level III and, after exposure of the submandibular gland and the extremely scarred digastric muscle, removal of a small amount of scar and fatty tissue. These are sent as a neck resectate for definitive histology. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the lingual artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery and exposure of the superior laryngeal artery. An accessorius nerve can no longer be visualized. Now release the digastric muscle. Exposure of the hyoid. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage horn. Now entering the hyoid laterally on the right. Very thin conditions here. Direct transition from scar tissue to enoral and here already conspicuous tissue. When the pharyngotomy is widened, contact is made with the pharyngeal tumor extension in the area of the right hypopharynx. Therefore, the hyoid is now removed. Widening of the pharyngotomy. Now a good overview of the tumor. Inclusion of the vallecula, epiglottis margin and a tongue base cuff and completion of the resection area towards the glossotonsillar groove. Now resect the pharynx to just before the middle of the hypopharynx and connect the resection area to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Now continue to expose the carotid artery and remove the entire soft tissue block subcutaneously. The tumor is now completely resected. In the area of the tumor injury during the pharyngotomy, the tumor was removed in a circumscribed and controlled manner for a better overview. Except for the caudal tumor cone, the R2 situation is marked here. Complete control of the basal tissue by exposing the common carotid artery and including the hyoid as well as the thyroid cartilage horn on the right. Inclusion of the entire tissue block. Cut around the residual tumor cone, which is located in front of the piriform sinus entrance. Finally, remove a strip of mucosa in the area of the caudal pharynx, towards the hypopharynx and the posterior pharyngeal wall, leaving a clear safety margin. All resectates are sent for frozen section diagnostics. Here, the area of the main specimen is clear except for the marked caudal margin, but with a narrow resection distance to the basal side. As already described, the entire cervical tissue was resected here. The caudal tumor cone also shows tumor-free margins in the resection area. The post-resectate is completely tumor-free. Therefore, due to the cervical resection of the wound bed or tumor bed and the free mucosal margins, a definitive R0 situation can be assumed. An approx. 2-3 mm thick vein accompanying the occipital artery was already secured in level IIa. Sufficient drainage to the mastoid was ensured. The prerequisites for a microvascular connection are therefore present. Due to the patient's slender proportions and the fresh humerus fracture, the decision was made to cover the defect using an ALT graft from the right. After marking the landmarks, doppler sonographic identification of two main peforators. Marking of a graft measuring 12 x 5.5. Medial incision. Separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the fascial plane. Exposure of the rectus femoris muscle. Clamping of the muscle cord. Subfascial dissection. Exposure of the vascular pedicle. It becomes apparent that both the ramus desendens and the ramus oblique of the lateral circumflex perforators are branching off into the graft. It was therefore decided to take both branches. Further exposure of the vascular pedicle. Visualization of the confluence of both branches. A common arterial inflow can be visualized. Visualization of the perforators, these are well developed. Complete cutting of the graft. Cut through to the fascia lata. Taking along the fascia lata and salvaging the graft while taking along a sufficiently protective muscle cuff around the perforators. Careful protection of the perforators. Isolation to the exposed artery and a strong vein and, with excellent flap perfusion, placement of the graft. Careful wound inspection, dry conditions after ligation of vascular stumps, dry conditions after wound irrigation with Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Now successive placement of 3/0 Vicryl mucosal sutures transcervically. Then pull the graft through enorally. Here, advance in the area of the posterior palatal arch or the soft palate dorsally and towards the nasopharynx. Incorporation of the graft enorally and complete suturing over the transcervically placed sutures. Finally, tight conditions. Good graft fit. Now prepare the lingual artery for vascularization. However, this is not continuous. No flow here even after shortening. Therefore clipping of the artery. Now expose the ascending pharyngeal artery. This shows a regular, good flow. Suturing conditions are now much more difficult due to the course of the vessel. Careful vessel position. Performing the vascular suture with 8/0 Ethilon. After reopening the Acland clamps, initially lack of perfusion, but excellent flow after repositioning the flap and handle. Immediate venous return and excellent flap vitality enorally. Then preparation of the occipital vein. Measurement of a 2.5 mm coupler, limited by the diameter of the occipital vein. Perform the coupler anastomosis. After reopening the clamps, immediate good perfusion of the graft and regular enoral vitality. Control of the course of the pedicle. The venous anastomosis now results in a tortuous but stable course without any significant tendency to kink. Positioning of the muscle cuff and careful, two-layer wound closure. Insertion of a flap. Control of the graft at the end of the operation. Excellent flap vitality. Transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit. A tracheotomy had already been performed previously. For this, a skin incision was made approx. 1 cm below the cricoid cartilage and a small access was made to avoid connecting the two wound cavities. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Insertion of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap. Incision of the Björk flap and the trachea. Performance of the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequent problem-free reintubation to an 8-gauge Rüsch cannula. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected ycT3 ycN0 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Postoperatively, please monitor the flap minutely.

After panendoscopy and CT findings, spread of the oropharyngeal carcinoma from the tonsillar lobe on the left over the palatal arch to the pharyngeal side wall on the right. In this case, progression to the base of the tongue. Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery is indicated.","First, pharyngoscopy again: The tumor is seen as already described, confirming the indication for surgery. PEG has already been placed. The first step is transoral tumor resection: the tumor is removed from all sides at a distance of at least 1.5 to 2 cm. Here, parts of the pharyngeal side wall on the left and the entire palatal arch as well as parts of the pharyngeal wall on the right up to the base of the tongue, which must be resected to about 20 to 30 %. The specimen is marked using sutures. In addition, a marginal specimen in the area of the palatal arch on the left up to the tonsil lobe on the left. Both specimens are sent for frozen section. Here still in situ spurs in the area of the palatal arch to the left tonsillar lobe. However, the marginal specimen is free. Nevertheless, another resection of a small strip from the area of the palatal arch to the lower resection margin, which is also included in this marginal specimen. This specimen is also thread-marked for the frozen section. No more tumor extensions here either. Thus now R0 resection. Now extensive hemostasis. Insertion of a hydrogen swab. Transfer to neck dissection, initially on the right: curved skin incision in the typical manner. Then expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the digastric muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the infrahyoid muscles. Subsequent visualization of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein, common carotid artery, external carotid artery, internal carotid artery. Visualization of the facial vein. Exposure of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. Successive creation of a neck dissection including nodes level II to V. Branches of the cervical plexus are preserved. Subsequent left neck dissection: This is performed in the same way as on the right side. Here, however, the neck dissection is limited to levels II to IV. Here too, careful hemostasis and irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Subsequent tracheostoma creation: small Kocher collar incision. Subsequent dissection through subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature. Splitting of these. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is clamped off, severed and supplied by means of puncture ligatures. Exposure of the trachea. Creation of a broadly pedicled, modified Björk flap. Subsequent epithelialization of the Björk flap. Re-intubation and insertion of a size 8 tracheal cannula, which is fixed with sutures. Now remove the radial artery from the left forearm: Measure the required area of the flap, which is just under 15 x just under 7 cm. Mark the flap in the required size and orientation. Then cut around the flap, initially from the ulnar side. Extend the incision into the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the superficial venous system, which is included in the graft. Subsequent incision of the flap from the radial side. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. Then exposure of the radial artery. This is first clamped for 15 to 20 minutes. Subsequently, the vascular pedicle is first exposed at the top. Exposure of the connection between the superficial and deep venous system. Then again locate the radial artery. Always good saturation of the hand with 100% saturation. Deposition of the radial artery. This is treated with 4-0 Prolene stitches. Anti-shear suture in the flap area. The flap is then lifted subfascially along the flap pedicle. Outgoing vessels are treated bipolar or with clips. Dissection along the pedicle up to the olecranon. Here, after clamping and with good saturation, the interosseous artery is removed. Two branches of the superficial venous system can be dissected as connecting vessels. The deep venous system consists of very small vessels, the confluence is very thin. Finally, the flap is placed on the brachial artery, here treated with a 6-0 Vascufil suture. Deposition at the confluence with a clip. Deposition at both ends of the superficial venous system and treatment with ligatures. Flushing of the flap with heparin. Subsequent insertion of the flap into the pharyngeal defect: First create a tunnel approx. 3 transverse fingers wide through the remaining pharyngeal muscles on the right side. Then pull the stalk through. Successive suturing of the flap into the defect, which begins at the base of the tongue or at the hypopharyngeal junction and extends to the opposite tonsil lobe. Tension-free suturing using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Then vascular anastomoses in the neck area. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery and the radial artery. These are connected using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and good venous return. The veins are conditioned. Both superficial veins are connected with 2 outlets from the facial artery. The 1st with a 3.0 mm coupler, the 2nd with a 2.0 mm coupler. Good venous return can be seen here in each case, positive smear phenomenon. Good aspect of the flap now also enoral. Subsequent careful hemostasis and irrigation of both sides of the neck. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain in both sides of the neck, guided on the right. Now closure of the forearm defect: Split skin with a thickness of 0.7 to 0.8 mm is removed from the thigh area using a dermatome. This is successively incorporated into the forearm defect. The skin incision in the direction of the crook of the elbow is closed in layers. The arm is always well supplied with blood. Then bandage with hydrogel, Mepilex. Loose compresses placed on top. Wrap in absorbent cotton. Fitting of a Kramer splint, which is fixed with an elastic bandage. Finally, positioning of the arm. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is ventilated and transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Please continue antibiotics with Unacid for 1 week. Heparin perfusor, which was started intraoperatively at 500 units per hour, should be continued for 5 days postoperatively. Feeding via the previously inserted PEG tube for 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Check the flap clinically and, if necessary, by Doppler according to the scheme. Wait for the final histology. Discussion of further procedure in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Tumor resection, Neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy creation

The above-mentioned surgery is now indicated.,"<CLINICIAN_NAME>: PEG placement: supine position, positioning of the head. Enter with the laryngoscope blade and adjust the esophageal inlet. Then insertion of the flexible oesophagoscope and pre-scanning into the stomach. The esophagus is completely unremarkable. Further inspection of the stomach and pylorus including inversion. Unremarkable conditions on all sides. A PEG tube was then inserted using the thread pull-through method. There was a good diaphanoscopy. Tracheotomy: First injection of suprarenin/ultracaine mixture. Then sterile washing and draping. Palpation of the cricoid cartilage, thyroid cartilage and trachea. Curved skin incision between the cricoid cartilage and jugulum. Dissection in depth down to the musculature. Expose the midline and push the muscles sideways. Insertion of a retractor and exposure of the thyroid gland. This is relatively large and covered by very thick veins. Dissection of the upper and lower thyroid poles. Undermining of the thyroid gland. Then entering with Kocher clamps and clamping of the thyroid gland on both sides. Separation of the isthmus. Bipolar coagulation beforehand. Ligation of both thyroid lobes and exposure of the trachea. Now insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Pushing these tracheal cartilages apart. The creation of a Björk flap is deliberately avoided as this tracheostoma is not intended to be permanent. Epithelialization of the skin in the sense of a visor tracheostomy. Insertion of an 8 mm Woodbridge tube. Skin suture at the lateral edges. Neck dissection on the right: Curved skin incision 2 cm below the mandible and T-shaped extension on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid, this skin incision was previously discussed with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Dissection of the platysma and exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Locate and expose the omohyoid. Insertion of a retractor. Then exploration of the submandibular gland. Locate the cervical vascular sheath. Finding and exposing the accessorius nerve. Then exploration of the digaster muscle. Finding and exposing the hypoglossal nerve. Then start of neck dissection with free dissection of the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial, then transition to level IIb and clearing of this level while sparing the accessorius nerve. Then evacuation of levels III and IV while sparing the plexus branches. Level V is not evacuated. Evacuation of level IIa and level Ib as well as Ia, initially leaving the submandibular gland intact, which is later removed by <CLINICIAN_NAME> as part of the anastomosis. Exposure of all relevant vessels, external jugular vein, facial vein, superior thyroid artery, facial artery in preparation for the anastomosis. Neck dissection left: Curved skin incision 2 cm below the lower jaw, then T-shaped extension on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Separation of the platysma. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland, which is enlarged and hardened and looks tumorously altered. Involvement of <CLINICIAN_NAME> who evacuates level Ib including the submandibular gland and level Ia and creates a tunnel to the opposite side as well as an opening in the floor of the mouth enorally in order to pass the flap through here later. Now expose the internal jugular vein and locate the accessorius nerve, which is unusually deep and runs dorsal to the internal jugular vein. Clearing out levels IIb, IIa, III and IV while sparing the plexus branches. Then exposure of the vessels, external jugular vein, facial vein, superior thyroid artery. Hemostasis on both sides by means of bipolar coagulation and insertion of Redon drains. Resection of the palatal arch tumor on the right: On the anterior palatal arch with transition to the soft palate, there is a tumorous change that appears to be finely bumpy on the outside and does not infiltrate into the depths. First mark the edges of the incision with the monopolar, starting at the base of the uvula in the soft palate, past the alveolar ridge of the maxilla, taking the glossotonsillar fold with it. Now start resecting the soft palate with scissors and, if necessary, bipolar forceps. The mucosa with underlying tissue is resected without completely removing the soft palate. Then removal of the glossotonsillar fold. Removal of the tonsil and a tongue base. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. The specimen is sent to histology marked with a thread. The pathologist was also able to detect carcinoma in situ in the frozen section medially on the soft palate. Therefore, a good ˝ cm was resected here again and then a marginal sample from this area was sent laterally to the frozen section with suture marking. This frozen section of the marginal sample was then tumor-free. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation. <CLINICIAN_NAME>: First transoral tumor resection: Initial oral floor resection: positioning of the head. Insertion of the mouth retractor. Tongue tie suture. Removal of the floor of mouth tumor, which is located in the anterior floor of the mouth and extends to the alveolar ridge. The tumor is incised with a safety margin of at least 1 cm on all sides. The periosteum is pushed away from the anterior bone. The muscles of the floor of the mouth are resected anteriorly if the growth appears to be deeper. Ductus Wharton is resected anteriorly on both sides. Removal of the tumor specimen and suture marking. Small focal infiltrates in the right tumor margin and at the junction of the alveolar ridge in the frozen section. Also carcinoma in situ in the area dorsal to the tongue. Therefore, another resection of a 1 cm wide resection dorsally towards the tongue and a wide resection laterally on the right up to the alveolar ridge. Due to the tumor resection, resection of the entire alveolar mucosa in the area of the incisors and canines as well as the first anterior molar is now indicated. These teeth must therefore be removed, which is done without complications. The entire alveolar ridge mucosa is then resected over the alveolar ridge. The mucosa is sent in with suture markings remote from the tumor. Similarly, marginal samples are sent in laterally on the right and dorsally from the tongue. No more tumor in the marginal specimens, thus R0 resection in the floor of the mouth. To confirm this, the bone in the anterior area is drilled back towards the alveoli with the large diamond drill, the alveoli are also drilled out and all mucosal parts are removed or drilled out. Then resection of the palatal/oropharyngeal sidewall carcinoma on the right (already included in the dictation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>). R0 resection at the end here too. Then laser resection of the carcinoma in situ of the left pocket fold: Insertion of the size C small bore tube. Exposure of the left pocket fold. A small bumpy area can be seen in which the preliminary biopsy was probably taken. This area is cut around broadly with a safety distance using the C02 laser 3 watt continuous wave with some soft tissue basally. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section. The frozen section shows carcinoma in situ infiltrates in the center, but peripherally free, thus also an R0 situation in the laryngeal region. Overall, R0 resection in all 3 resected tumors. Neck dissection on both sides and tracheotomy now follows. (already included in the dictation of <CLINICIAN_NAME>). Subsequent removal of the radial flap: the defect in the floor of the mouth is carefully measured beforehand. A flap with a maximum length of 9.5 cm and a maximum width of 6.5 cm is created. This is measured according to the defect. The defect is marked on the forearm in the appropriate size and shape. Then apply a tourniquet. Elevation of the flap first from the ulnar, then from the radial subfascial. Incision curved towards the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the superficial venous system. Exposure of the flap pedicle and brachioradialis muscle. Successive elevation of the radial flap. Distal exposure of the radial artery, here ligation with 4-0 Prolene. Successive elevation of the flap under its pedicle, smaller, outgoing vessels are supplied bipolar or closed with clips. The ulnar, interosseous and radial arteries can be visualized in the elbow area, as can the deep venous system and the connection to the superficial venous system. There are 2 larger veins here which can be used as an anastomosis. Deposition of the flap on 2 veins and 1 artery. Very good re-perfusion after opening the tourniquet. Sufficiently long re-perfusion time. The flap is then placed on the veins and the artery. The veins are ligated and the artery is supplied with a 4-0 Prolene puncture ligature. The flap is then rinsed with heparin solution. The flap is then sutured into the defect in the floor of the mouth: a wide tunnel is created from the left, through which the stalk is passed and brought over to the right side. The flap is successively sutured into the defect according to its shape and extent. Tension-free, complete defect coverage. Flap pedicle is passed through the tunnel to the right side. The veins and the artery are conditioned here. The superior thyroid artery is selected and conditioned as the anastomotic vessel. Suture to the radial artery with 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and good venous return. Subsequent suturing of the cephalic vein to a terminal branch of the facial vein, which was previously prepared and conditioned. This is done with a size 3.5 coupler. The second venous vessel is then anastomosed to another small vein using a size 2.5 coupler. Good venous return and positive smear phenomenon in each case. Overall good flap perfusion, good arterial flow and good venous return. Careful irrigation of the wound area and hemostasis. Wound closure of each side of the neck and insertion of a Redon drain, which was fixed separately on the right side. Flap perfusion good to the end. A piece of full-thickness skin is now removed from the right groin in the typical manner. This is thinned out. After mobilization of the skin, the groin is closed in several layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. After thinning, the skin is inserted into the defect and sutured in place without tension. The cranial wound towards the elbow was closed in several layers in the typical manner. Subsequent application of a hydrogel-Mepilex dressing, loose application of compresses. Absorbent cotton dressing. Wrapping of the hand in the appropriate position on a Kramer splint using an elastic bandage. Hand is and was well supplied with blood at all times. The procedure was completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics for 1 week, which had already been started intraoperatively. Flap control for 5 days according to the scheme using Doppler and clinically. Heparin perfusor 500 units/hour for 5 days. Feeding via PEG tube for 7 to 10 days. After that, diet build-up. Radiochemotherapy appears to be indicated for a total of 3 tumors and a bilateral N+ situation. Presentation in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Resection, Neck dissection

Suspicion of tonsillar carcinoma on the left as part of the ENT mirror examination. There is now an indication for panendoscopy and histological confirmation. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.,"After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carry out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. Induction of anesthesia and transition to rigid tracheoscopy. Problem-free passage of the glottis and endotracheal entry. The mucosal conditions are inconspicuous on all sides up to the exit of the segmental bronchi. The endoscope is then removed and the patient intubated by the surgeon. Transition to esophagogastroscopy. Insertion of the endoscope under visualization and constant air insufflation into the stomach. A slightly erosively altered gastric mucosal relief can be seen here. Inspection of the corpus fundus antrum and pylorus. Entering the inversion. Inspection of the gastroesophageal junction. Here refluxy change. Desufflation slow withdrawal of the endoscope with circular inspection of all esophageal sections. There is no evidence of a synchronous second tumor. Remove the endoscope and position the patient in head reclination. Insert a compress to protect the alveolar ridge. Enter with the size C small bore tube. First, adjust the endolarynx. This is unremarkable. Then inspect the hypopharynx, the postcricoid region and the esophageal entrance. The mucosal conditions are unremarkable on all sides. The same applies to the base of the tongue. The supraglottic region as well as the oral cavity and oral vestibule. Only in the area of the left tonsil is there a superficially growing, circumscribed exophytic change extending from the middle to the caudal left tonsil pole. The borders of the tonsil are respected both by inspection and palpation. In summary, CT1- maximum CT2 tonsillar carcinoma on the left is suspected. Since the tumor is strictly limited to the tonsil, the decision is now made to perform an excision biopsy in the sense of a tumor tonsillectomy. To do this, first grasp the tonsil and medialize it. Incision of the mucosa close to the uvula, exposing the tonsil capsule. Successive dissection along the capsule in the area of the cranial part. In the middle and caudal sections, part of the palatal arch muscles of the anterior and posterior palatal arch are also resected in order to ensure a sufficient safety margin. After caudal dissection into the base of the tongue. Macroscopically, the tumor was resected in toto. Suture marking of the tumor resectate and sending for frozen section diagnostics. Cis-like changes can still be seen in the area of the anterior palatal arch. The tumor is resected again and the resectate is sent in for frozen section diagnostics. R0 situation at the end of the operation. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Dry wound conditions at the end of the operation. Final consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Removal of the mouth blocker and completion of the operation without complications. Conclusion: suspected CT1-2 tonsillar carcinoma on the left. Neck dissection on the left side and, if necessary, PEG insertion must now be planned in a two-stage procedure.","Panendoscopy, Excisional biopsy of left tonsil in the context of a tumor tonsillectomy

Described in the pre-endoscopy as a carcinoma in the oropharynx and hypopharynx. Now after interdisciplinary tumor conference above mentioned intervention indicated.,"First, pharyngo- and laryngoscopy again: The exophytic tumor is seen with deep crater formation in the area of the palatal arch up to the uvula, growth on the posterior side of the palatal arch and towards the nasopharynx, growth deep into the soft tissues towards the pharyngeal wall and mandible, growth up to the base of the tongue via the lateral oropharyngeal wall and into the hypopharynx. Larynx itself not involved by macroscopically visible tumor. Confirmation of the indication for surgery. Now PEG placement, neck dissection and tracheostoma placement. These surgical steps are dictated by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First placement of a PEG tube. This is carried out without complications using the thread pull-through method with adequate diaphanoscopy in the typical manner. A neck dissection is then performed on the right side. Creation of a skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure in the depth of the nervus accessorius, the omohyoid muscle and the posterior venter of the digaster muscle. Dissection along the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure and sparing of the vagus nerve and the common carotid artery. Removal of the neck specimen posteriorly while sparing the above-mentioned structures. Protection of the deep plexus branches. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Subsequent removal of the anterior neck preparation. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation using hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Placement of a 10 Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Now repositioning of the patient to perform a neck dissection on the left side. Creation of a skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin, the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure and dissection along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, the posterior venter of the digaster muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the capsule of the submandibular gland, which is removed in the preparation. Exposure and protection of the cervical vascular sheath. Removal of the posterior neck specimen while preserving the above-mentioned structures and the plexus branches. Removal of the anterior neck specimen. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Placement of a 10 Redon drain and two-layer wound closure and completion of the neck dissection on the left side. A tracheotomy is then performed in the typical manner. Creation of a skin incision directly below the level of the cricoid cartilage, approx. 3 cm long. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus using Pean clamps. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus and ligation of both thyroid stumps. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Creation of a tracheal incision between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasp using a scalpel. Creation of a Björk flap in the typical manner and epithelization of the tracheostoma. Reintubation to a size 8 Rügheim tracheostomy tube. Completion of the procedure without complications. Subsequent combined transcervical, transoral tumor resection: First, all vessels, internal jugular vein, internal and external carotid artery and all cranial nerves including vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and glossopharyngeal nerve are severed from the pharyngeal wall to the base of the skull and marked with vessel loops. Detachment of the tumor from the spinal column, which is successful with a blunt approach, no infiltrations visible here. Then cut around the tumor from the transoral side with a safety margin of at least 1.5 to 2 cm on all sides. The entire palatal arch falls down to the uvula, leaving the remaining palatal arch on the left. The soft palate is resected, as well as the posterior side up to the nasopharynx, taking the tube partially with it. Push off the soft tissue under control from the outside to just in front of the lower jaw. Co-resection of the pharyngeal wall and the pterygoid muscles. Detachment of the tumor also from the transoral and cranial side of the spinal column. Large parts of the posterior pharyngeal wall are also resected. The tumor is resected from the transcervical side in the tongue base area, whereby almost half of the tongue base area with vallecula and parts of the lateral epiglottis as well as parts of the hyoid bone are also resected. The resection extends into the piriform sinus and includes parts of the lateral laryngeal area including parts of the thyroid cartilage from the mucosa to the arytenoid fold. However, arytenoid cartilage is preserved. Vallecula parts are resected up to the middle. The entire specimen is removed and marked using several sutures. In addition, marginal samples are taken caudally from the posterior pharyngeal wall, from the piriform sinus up to the arytenoid fold, basally from the base of the tongue with soft tissue and mucosa, a marginal sample basally caudally, a marginal sample from the lateral epiglottis and a marginal sample from the posterior wall of the palatine arch at the transition to the nasopharynx. The specimen as a whole is in situ, as are the marginal samples, i.e. R0 situation. The defect includes the piriform sinus, lateral oropharyngeal side wall, palatal arch, posterior pharyngeal wall, base of tongue and vallecula. Defect is measured three-dimensionally. Irrigation of the wound area with H2O2 and Ringer's solution and careful hemostasis. The dimensions and size of the defect are recorded on the right forearm, flap size max. 16 cm in length and just under 10 cm in width. Now flap removal: first cut around the flap ulnarly subfascially. Extend the incision into the crook of the elbow. Subsequent exposure of the radial artery. This is initially clamped for 15 to 20 minutes. ........... Incision of the flap also from radial subfascial. Ramus cutaneus antebrachii is preserved as far as possible. The superficial venous system is exposed and also elevated. Exposure of the vascular pedicle under the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the connection between the superficial and deep venous system. Now expose the radial artery. This is relatively deep. Pulse oximeter always at 100% after clamping, no special features or abnormalities. 100% saturation even after clamping until the end of the operation. Successive lifting of the flap subfascially. Outgoing smaller vessels are clipped or bipolar coagulated. Lift the flap with the superficial vein system and pedicle up to the antecubital fossa. Two branches from the cephalic vein can be dissected here as connecting veins. The radial artery can also be dissected up to just before the brachial artery entrance. Also a venous confluence. The interosseous artery was cut and ligated. The flap was then removed. The edge of the radial antebrachial artery is treated with Prolene 4-0 puncture ligatures. The veins are ligated. Flap vessels are flushed with heparin. A piece of full-thickness skin of the appropriate size is removed from the groin. This is conditioned and incorporated into the forearm defect. The cranial defect is closed in layers. A hydrogel-Mepilex dressing and a swab dressing are applied, wrapping with sterile absorbent cotton, application of a Kramer splint and wrapping of the arm with an elastic bandage, application of the arm. Blood circulation always ensured. Now insert the flap into the defect. Gradual incorporation of the flap. The palatal arch area can be effectively replaced, as can all anatomical regions. Only in the cranial area of the posterior wall is complete defect coverage not possible, here not only a double but a triple fold would have to be made, which does not appear to be technically possible. To secure the nasopharyngeal passage, a gastric tube is inserted during flap insertion and the position is also successfully checked. Suturing is performed with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures, partly from the transoral and partly from the transcervical side, partly also after the insertion of sutures. The result is a tension-free and complete closure of the defect, whereby, as described, the most cranial parts of the posterior pharyngeal wall are not covered. There is still muscle and fascia on the spine. The vessels on the flap and in the neck area are then conditioned. The superior thyroid artery is selected, which is connected to the radial artery in 8-0 single button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. Subsequent conditioning of the veins. It can be seen that a vein can still be used at the internal jugular artery. However, it is also apparent that the internal jugular vein is partially thrombosed due to insufficient flow. Opening of the vein, thrombus can be expressed, after which flow is possible again. Due to the fact that there are no other veins left and the stalk cannot be passed through to the left side due to the shortness of the stalk relative to the required distance, the largest cephalic vein is now connected to the facial vein using a 3-0 coupler. Good flow after opening, also positive smear phenomenon. No further signs of thrombosis in the further course, so that here, with probably a lack of return flow from the cerebrum, the return flow from the flap appears to counteract further thrombosis. Other veins are clipped. Enoral flap control brings good conditions. Irrigation of the entire wound area. Careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain on both sides, guided on the right. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient transferred to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue heparin perfusor, which was started intraoperatively at 500 units per hour, for 5 days. Continue antibiotic treatment with Unacid, which was started preoperatively, for 1 week. Feeding via PEG for at least 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, slow, careful build-up of diet. Flap control according to the scheme for 5 days by means of Doppler and clinical checks. Position of the anastomosis or stalk marked with suture. Overall multistage carcinoma cT4 cN2c. Postoperative radiochemotherapy certainly indicated. Please discuss the procedure in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Resection, Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

In this regard, a tracheotomy was performed in an emergency <2013>. At our interdisciplinary tumor conference, it was decided to perform a laryngectomy with neck dissection on both sides. Therefore indication for the above procedure.","After induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues through the tracheostoma already in place, first renewed laryngoscopy and confirmation of tumor extension. Then infiltration anesthesia. Sterile wiping, draping. Curved skin incision that includes the old tracheostoma. Creation of an apron flap strictly subplatysmal. This works very well. First start with the neck dissection on the right side. Further dissection of the sternocleidomastoid anterior edge. Dissection along the muscle up to the posterior edge. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the accessorius nerve. These leading structures are spared during the entire operation. Exposure and dissection along the internal jugular vein and the facial vein. The structures are spared. Multiple lymph nodes are already present in this area, all of which are removed. After mobilization and exposure of the cervical vascular sheath with carotid and vagus, development of the lateral neck preparation. This is very successful. All plexus branches are spared. Now further dissect and develop the anterior neck preparation, including the capsule of the submandibular vein. Expose and protect the hypoglossal nerve and the digastric muscle. Bipolar hemostasis. Neck dissection on the left is performed in the same way. Here too, all important structures such as the internal jugular vein, facial vein, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve and the cervical vascular sheath are exposed and spared. Dissection of the hyoid bone with dissection of the infrahyoid and suprahyoid muscles. Mobilization and retraction of the thyroid gland from the trachea. Successive skeletonization of the laryngeal skeleton and detachment of the prelaryngeal musculature. Exposure of the cornu majus on both sides. Careful, blunt dissection of the pharyngeal tube from the inner sides of the thyroid cartilage on both sides. Further inspection reveals that the tumor is growing into the soft tissue in the area of the hyoid bone on the right side. Entering the pharyngeal tube suprahyoidally. Inspection of the tumor. Here it can be seen that the tumor is occupying the entire laryngeal lumen and appears to be growing submucosally on the right side into the base of the tongue. A generous resection is now performed macroscopically far into the healthy tissue. Ultimately, the complete laryngeal preparation with the tumor can be pushed caudally. Separation of the esophagus from the trachea. The trachea is finally removed at the level of the previously created tracheostoma. This preparation is now sent for final histology. Generous marginal samples are taken from strategically important points and from the base of the tongue, parapharyngeal area on the right and suprahyoidal area on the right side. These are sent for frozen section and are found to be tumor-free on all sides. Careful pharyngeal suturing is now performed, paying particular attention to tension-free adaptation in the area of the base of the tongue. Multi-layer pharyngeal suture. Adaptation of the former prelaryngeal musculature over the pharyngeal suture. Overall, this results in at least three to four layers of closure in this area. Prior to this, a Provox prosthesis was inserted in the typical manner by the phoniatrics colleagues. Insertion of two Redon drains. Pushing back the apron flap. Readaptation in the area of the tracheostoma. Further two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure bandage. Completion of the procedure without complications. Conclusion: Overall laryngectomy with neck dissection on both sides and placement of a Provox prosthesis for T4 supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma. X-ray pre-swallow recommended in 7-10 days, if the findings are normal, slow diet build-up. Further procedure depending on the histology at our interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy

The above-mentioned surgery was therefore indicated.","Total cT3 tumor. Midline of the tongue reached, but not crossed. Repeated pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy as well as oral cavity inspection: confirmation of tumor extension. Correspondingly, another CT assessment. PEG placement is now performed first: insertion with the esophagoscope through the esophagus into the stomach. After establishing spontaneous diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube without any problems. Fixation to the abdominal wall. Then tumor resection: Start with transoral resection: visualization of the tumor. The tumor is incised macroscopically and palpated on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1-1.5 cm. The posterior 2/3 of the tongue is removed up to above the midline, in the tongue base area about half of the tongue base is removed. In the floor of the mouth, removal of all soft tissue up to the lower jaw including the lingual nerve. Glossoalveolar groove and tonsil are resected together with parts of the pharyngeal side wall, caudal to it. As the overview of the soft tissue extension dorso-caudally below the mandible is not quite sufficient, the decision was made to complete the resection from transcervical to neck dissection. Therefore, repositioning to complete the tumor resection and neck dissection on both sides. Injection of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into each side of the neck. Marking of the required tracheostomy. Start with neck dissection on the left: Skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of digastric muscle, omohyoid muscle and infrahoyidal muscles. Exposure of the submandibular gland, which is initially left in place. Evacuation of level II-V. Internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, internal jugular vein, facial vein and external jugular vein are exposed and preserved. The accessorius, hypoglossal and vagus nerves and the branches of the cervical plexus are also preserved. This results in a level II to V neck dissection. Subsequent completion of the tumor resection. For this purpose, the digastric and styloid muscles are severed. Dissection of the submandibular gland. This is removed with all attached soft tissue en bloc with the soft tissue in connection with the inner tumor preparation and pulled through transorally. The tumor preparation is thread-marked and sent for frozen section. All tumor margins free in the specimen. In the dorso-basal area at the transition from the body of the tongue to the base of the tongue, removal of the tumor bordering on the resection margins, therefore another slice of soft tissue is removed from this area, which is then sent for final diagnosis. Overall R0 situation. This is followed by neck dissection on the right side: This is performed by A. Dittberner. Evacuation of levels II to IV in a typical manner with exposure of the internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, superior thyroid artery. V. jugularis interna, externa. V. jugularis cannot be preserved due to a tear and is ligated. Exposure of the vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve as well as the branches of the cervical plexus, all structures are preserved. This results in evacuation of levels II to IV. Cranially, the submandibular gland is exposed and preserved. Subsequent tracheostoma creation: small Kocher collar incision, exposure of subcutaneous tissue, platysma. Dissection through the infrahyoid muscles after spreading them in the linea alba. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped off, severed and supplied by means of puncture ligatures. Exposure of the trachea. Creation of a broadly pedicled Björk flap. This is epithelized in the typical manner. Re-intubation and insertion of a laryngectomy tube. Subsequent irrigation of all wound areas with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Removal of the forearm flap: measurement of the demissions results in a flap length of 11-12 cm and a width of up to 7 cm. The flap is marked on the forearm in the required size and shape. First cut around the flap from the ulnar side. Extension of the incision into the crook of the elbow. Depiction of the superficial venous system. Incision of the flap from the radial side. Lifting of the flap from ulnar and radial subfascial. Distal clamping of the radial artery. Exposure of the pedicle with the radial artery and radial vein. Dissection up to the olecranon. Exposure of the connection between the superficial and deep venous system. Two outlets from the area of the cephalic vein can be visualized. An acceptable confluence in the area of the radial vein. The radial artery is then removed. This is treated with puncture ligatures 4-0 Prolene. Lift the flap subfascially along the pedicle, smaller branches are coagulated or glued bipolarly. Dissection up to the antecubital fossa. The interosseous artery is clamped for 10 minutes. Here too, as before clamping the radial artery, constant saturation above 100 %. Disconnect the interosseous artery. Then remove the flap. The brachial artery is treated with 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Here too, saturation at 100 %. The veins are clamped and ligated. Flap is removed and flushed with heparin solution. After careful hemostasis, the proximal part of the forearm is closed in layers. The forearm defect is covered with thick split skin 0.7-0.8 mm. For this purpose, split skin is removed from the right thigh with the dermatome. Suture the split skin into the forearm defect. Thigh is treated with hydrogel dressing. The forearm is treated with ..............-Mepilex dressing, with a loose swab dressing on top, which is modeled using absorbent cotton. Fitting of a cramp splint. This is loosely fixed with a tape bandage. Positioning of the arm. Subsequent suturing of the radial flap into the defect: After partial suturing, the flap is gradually worked into the defect. Tension-free suturing of the flap is achieved. The stem is inserted through the large tunnel into the soft tissues of the neck. Complete tension-free defect coverage. Vessels are conditioned. The radial artery is sutured to the superior thyroid artery after conditioning. For this purpose, fish-mouth-like dilation of the superior thyroid artery. Suture with Ethilon 9-0 sutures. After opening the previously inserted clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. Both outlets of the cephalic vein are conditioned for the anastomosis. One outlet is anastomosed with an outlet from the facial vein after conditioning using a 2.5 mm coupler. After opening the clamp, there is no venous return. Positive smear phenomenon. The other outlet from the cephalic vein is anastomosed after conditioning with the external jugular vein using a 3.5 mm coupler. Here too, after opening the clamp, reflux without any problems, positive smear phenomenon. Subsequent clipping of the still open confluence. Irrigation of the entire neck area and careful hemostasis. Layered wound closure on the right with insertion of a Redon drain. Layered wound closure on the left with insertion of 2 flaps. Insertion of a tracheostomy tube, which is fixed with sutures. Tracheal cannula with size 8. Repeated inspection of the flap. This is vital. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient has received Unacid several times intraoperatively. Please continue this antibiotic treatment for one week. Patient goes to intensive care unit for monitoring. Please elevate the patient's upper body.

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the indication for primary surgery was given.","After an introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleagues, preparation by the anesthesia colleagues and positioning of the patient. The primary tumor is inspected first. This is done with the small bore tube under dental protection. There is a rough mass in the right tonsil lobe extending submucosally into the soft palate. On palpation, it clearly extends laterally towards the soft tissue of the neck and clearly exceeds the caudal border of the tonsillar lobe. Growth into the glosso tonsillar groove, but no tongue infiltration. The tumor extends submucosally to the mandible, but clearly does not infiltrate it. The PEG is now inserted. This is done with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy advancement into the stomach. Excellent diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. Inconspicuous oesophagus on reflection. After positioning the patient, injection of xylocaine with adrenaline additive cervically due to lateral growth, primarily transcervical procedure to secure the cervical vascular sheath. For this purpose, a skin incision is made at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the skin and subcutaneous tissue are cut, the platysma is cut, the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle are exposed. First expose and clear the anterior neck preparation and preserve the superior thyroid artery, the hyperglossal nerve and the cervical vein. A true facial vein is not pronounced, preservation of the extremely strong external jugular vein. Now free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Macroscopically, there are clearly conspicuous nodules in levels II and III due to their size. Anterior neurolysis of the hypergossic nerve with attached cervical vein. Reintegration of the nerve, followed by exposure of the accessorius nerve, also here neurolysis and reinsertion of the nerve. After complete exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, the vagus nerve is also exposed. This is also mobilized by neurolysis and then re-embedded. Elongated exposure of the common carotid artery, the bulb and the internal and external carotid artery. The facial vein is alloyed during subsequent dissection of the transcervical access artery, but is otherwise preserved. All carotid branches. The accessorius triangle is then dissected and level V dissected, carefully preserving the cervical plexus branches. The submandibular gladula is now released with careful protection and release of the marginal mandibular ramus, re-embedding of the nerve, separation of the gland, resection of the digastric muscle, posterior venter, removal of level I b. Here too, several nodules measuring up to 1.5 cm. The tumor can now be clearly palpated in the area of the lateral pharyngeal wall. Now combined transoral and transcervical procedure. Cut around the tumor with a visual distance of a good 1 cm. Reaching from paraovular over the soft palate up to the algular ridge and just including the lateral edge of the tongue, also resection up to the posterior floor of the mouth. It can be seen that the tumor also clearly infiltrates the posterior palatal arch including the musculature. Therefore complete involvement of the muscular posterior palatal arch. Resection down to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Macroscopic in sano resection on all sides both to the edges and clearly basally. Transcervical completion of the tumor dissection also towards the caudal pharyngeal wall. Macroscopic in sano. The tumor specimen is now sent in thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. This shows discontinuous tumor growth in the area of the lateral margin. Therefore, according to the buccal mucosa of the alveolar ridge and the posterior floor of the mouth, resection specimens are taken and imaged with new margin samples. These are finally diagnosed as tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Otherwise, all resection margins are tumor-free without high-grade dysplasia. The defect is now measured for subsequent reconstruction. First the neck dissection of the opposite side. To do this, make a skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, cut through the platysma, expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle, Release of the submandibular gland, exposure of the digastric muscle, removal of the anterior neck preparation while preserving the superior thyroid artery and then neurolysis of the hyperglossal nerve with attached cervical nerve. Re-embedding of the nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, exposure of the accessorius nerve, neurolysis of the nerve and re-embedding. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Subsequent evacuation of level V a with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. There may be a caudal indication of lymph leakage. Overall, no suspicious lymph node changes on the left side. Final wound irrigation with Ringer's solution, insertion of a 10-gauge redon drain if the wound is absolutely dry and careful two-layer wound closure. The plastic tracheostomy is then performed. Skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, expose and cut through the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus after supply. Insertion between the second and third tracheal ring. Creation of a wide-base styled PJ flap and subsequent insertion of the tracheostoma with mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequently, problem-free reintubation to a size 8 low-coff cannula. The radialis graft is then lifted from the left forearm. After marking, the 9x6 cm graft is measured with a special soft palate and mouth configuration. Cutting around the graft, exposing and taking along the cephalic vein. Exposure of the superficial ramus, radial nerve and complete preservation of the nerve. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle, transection of the vascular pedicle. Reciprocal exposure of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle, strictly subfacial release of the graft. Subsequent preparation of the pedicle, including the cephalic vein. Cubital part showing a strong vascular connection from superficial to deep venous systems. Therefore preservation of the venous bridge. Exposure and preservation of the common interosseous artery. Removal of the radial artery. After reopening the tourniquet with a vital graft and regular blood supply to the hand. Careful hemostasis. Subsequent careful two-layer wound closure. Incision of the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the right groin. Application of a vacuum dressing and positioning of the ......... in a functional position. Subsequent repositioning of the arm. For full-thickness skin harvesting from the right groin. Incision of an oval skin area measuring approx. 10x6 cm. Strictly cutaneous elevation. Careful subcutaneous mobilization, insertion of a 10-redon drain in dry wound conditions and multi-layer wound closure. Now combined transoral and transcervical graft fitting. Overall very good fit and sufficient and complete reconstruction of the defect. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery and the strong superior thyroid vein. For anastomization, perform the arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. This is successful with immediate venous return. Conditioning of the vein. Measure a size 4.0 cuppler and perform the venous anastomosis with the cuppler system. Subsequent regular graft perfusion as well as positive spreading phenomenon and regular style pulsation, so that after careful wound irrigation and inspection, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drainage and careful wound closure. The patient was then repositioned, a final consultation was held with the anesthesia colleagues and the procedure was completed with a vital graft. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with 3g Unacid. Please continue this for 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resistant at least cT2 and cN2B oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Careful postoperative flap monitoring. If the graft heals properly and the graft is intact, a gradual diet can be started from the eighth postoperative day with a good prognosis with regard to swallowing function. Presentation at our interdisciplinary tumor conference to plan adjuvant therapy.","Tumor resection, Defect reconstruction, Free flap (Radial), Neck dissection, Plastic tracheotomy, PEG placement

A flexible esophagogastroscopy was performed using an endoscope, which was carefully advanced to the stomach under constant insufflation. The entire stomach up to the pylorus was unremarkable. The entire oesophagus was unremarkable. In the same session, a percutaneous endoscopically controlled gastrostomy was performed in the typical manner using the thread pull-through method. This was very successful. Subsequent adjustment of the tumor findings in the oral cavity using 2 self-retaining retractors. Placement of a rein suture and marking of the incision under the tumor findings using an electric needle. Successive removal of the mass at the tip of the tongue. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. The specimen is sent in for final histology with thread marking. Collection of 5 marginal samples (cranial towards the back of the tongue, right lateral, left lateral, caudal towards the floor of the mouth, wound bed). The marginal samples are sent for intraoperative frozen section examination and found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleagues. Thus, an R0 situation in the area of the tip of the tongue can be assumed. Repeated inspection. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Removal of the self-retaining retractors. Then perform a neck dissection on both sides of region I, II, III, initially on the right side.

An exophytic mass is seen here, which extends at the level of the ascending mandible towards the last molar of the maxilla. The tumor extends caudally into the tonsillar lobe and reaches the tip of the hypopharyngeal side wall. Preliminary consultation with the anesthesiologist. The patient has already been positioned and nasotracheally intubated. Insertion of the mouth blocker. Cutting around the tumor with the electric needle. It can be seen here that the tumor extends to the gingiva of the last molar of the left maxilla. Therefore, tooth extraction in toto with all roots. The alveolus appears tumor-free. A frozen section sample is taken from the alveolar margin, which is found to be tumor-free intraoperatively. Further incision of the tumor caudally with a safety margin of about 4-5 mm. The tumor extends caudally to the lower edge of the tonsil lobe. The resection is performed on the pharyngeal musculature. The anterior palatal arch must also be resected here. The posterior palatal arch is preserved in the cranial part. Lateral exposure of pharyngeal fat, which is coagulated here but appears absolutely tumor-free. Marginal samples are also taken from this area. Border samples are also taken after complete tumor excision in the area of the anterior and posterior margin as well as the cranial and caudal margin. All margin samples are also found to be tumor-free intraoperatively in the frozen section. Subsequent subtle hemostasis. Insertion of a hydrogen-soaked swab. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection on the left side. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline. Skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Dissection in layers in depth after cutting through the platysma. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Clearing of neck dissection levels Ib to V and preservation of all branches of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery. Also exposing the nerve structures. In this case, long-distance exposure of the vagus nerve in the cervical vascular sheath. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve. Same procedure for the accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. The cervical profunda can also be preserved. Finally, the entire neck preparation is sent for histopathological examination. In the area of the vein angle, slightly enlarged, macroscopically rather suspicious nodules were found. The final result remains to be determined by histopathology. Dissection in the area of the hypoglossal triangle and in the area of the pharynx was carried out extremely carefully. In the end, it is apparent that there is no penetrating defect to the pharynx. Careful palpation of the pharyngeal side wall, which still appears sufficiently thick, so that the decision is now made not to perform a local reconstruction by means of tissue transfer. The pharyngeal side wall is simply tightened slightly and closed over the exposed fatty tissue as a local mucosoplasty. Insertion of a wound flap. Two-layer wound closure of the neck. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection on the right side. Here too, skin incision along the sternocleidomastoid after injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline. Layer-by-layer dissection in depth. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. This is also exposed over a long distance. Then dissection of the neck preparation of levels Ib to V. All nervous and vascular structures are also preserved here. As part of the dissection, long-distance exposure, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve at the end of the operation. Same procedure in the area of the accessorius and hypoglossal nerve. Preservation of the cervical profunda here too. Finally, subtle hemostasis and insertion of a Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Decision to insert a PEG tube due to the defect and the expected adjuvant therapy. Easy insertion into the esophagus with the flexible instrument. Visual visualization up to the stomach, where a regular fold relief is visible. Locate the diaphanoscopy and the appropriate puncture site. Then insert the PEG tube using the thread pull-through method. Positive tenting phenomenon when puncturing the abdominal wall. Aspiration of the insufflated air and reflection of the esophagus. Dressing application. Transition to tracheotomy. Due to the large wound area, after intraoperative discussion of the findings, decision to tracheotomize the patient, in the sense of a protective tracheostomy. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline in the area of the jugulum. Modified Kocher incision and layered preparation in depth. Separation of the infralaryngeal and pretracheal muscles in the midline. Exposure of the very slender thyroid isthmus. This is coagulated and cut in the middle. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp. Dissection of a Björk flap. Circular mucocutaneous anastomization of the tracheostoma. Re-intubation to a 7-gauge cannula. Dressing application. Final wound check of the neck on both sides and the enoral wound. Application of a pressure dressing on both sides of the neck. Final consultation with the anesthetist.","Resection, Neck dissection, and Tracheotomy, PEG placement

Withdrawal of the endoscope and inspection of the esophagus. Inconspicuous conditions there. A laryngoscopy was then performed using a Kleinsasser C-tube. This revealed a circularly growing glottic laryngeal carcinoma extending to the arytenoid region on both sides and into the anterior commissure with slight spread into the subglottis without infiltration of the supraglottis. Otherwise, the piriform sinuses on both sides, the posterior hypopharyngeal wall and the postcricoid region as well as the esophageal inlet were unremarkable. The posterior wall of the oropharynx and the lateral walls were endoscopically unremarkable. The base of the tongue was unremarkable on endoscopy and palpation. Thus, and taking into account the clinical findings (SL arrest on the left and SL immobility on the right), the indication for complete laryngectomy and neck dissection on both sides was determined. Application of local anesthesia cervically on both sides and medially. Skin ablation and sterile draping. Creation of a subplatysmal apron flap in the typical manner. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and thyroid isthmus, undermining of the same, exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea and incision between the 3rd and 4th tracheal cartilage clasp. Fixation of the tracheal margin at the skin edge and reintubation on a size 8 laryngectomy tube. Subsequent dissection along the anterior sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side. Exposure of the capsule of the submandibular gland, exposure of the accessorius nerve and the digaster muscle (venter posterior). Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and exposure of the cervical vascular sheath from caudal to cranial, successive dissection along the cervical vascular sheath while protecting it and the plexus branches. Removal of the posterior and anterior neck specimen while protecting the above-mentioned structures. Hemostasis there using bipolar coagulation. Dry conditions. Repositioning of the patient to perform a neck dissection on the left side. Dissection along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the left side. Exposure of the accessorius nerve in depth. Exposure of the posterior venter of the digaster muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection along the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial. Successive removal of the posterior and anterior neck preparation while protecting the above-mentioned structures and the plexus branches. Hemostasis there using bipolar coagulation and subsequent concentration in the cervical median area. Separation of the prelaryngeal muscles in the midline. Exposure of multiple, conspicuous nodes in region VI. These are then removed and sent for final histology. The prelaryngeal musculature is then cut at the level of the hyoid bone using a monopolar knife. Exposure of the epiglottis after transection of the hyoepiglottic ligament. Exposure of the free edge of the epiglottis. Opening of the pharyngeal lumen and downward retraction of the epiglottis with the hyoid bone. Mucosal incision along the free epiglottis edges and the aryepiglottic folds on both sides. Followed by a scalpel incision along the posterior edge of the thyroid cartilage on both sides. Subperichondral preparation and protection of the piriform sinuses on both sides. Subsequently, union of both vertical mucosal incisions in the area of the plica aryepiglottica on both sides in the postcricoid area. Further submucosal dissection while sparing the mucosa and the submucosa of the anterior esophageal wall. Further dissection between the trachea and esophagus. Dissection at this level and placement of the laryngectomy specimen between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasp. Two marginal samples (tracheal resection margin, anterior wall of the left piriform sinus) were sent for frozen section - both were found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleagues. Subsequently, paramedian myotomy of the cricopharyngeal muscle on the left side and partial resection of the caudal part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides. Subsequently, a size 10 Provox-Vega was placed retrograde without any problems, followed by a four-layer pharyngeal suture (mucosa, submucosa, pharyngeal muscle layer, infrahyoid muscles). This results in complete pharyngeal closure. Subsequently, to secure the pharyngeal suture, insertion of cut pieces of TachoSil along the entire pharyngeal suture. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Knock back the subplatysmal apron flap and fix its caudal edge to the tracheostoma. Platysma suture. Single button skin suture. Application of a pressure bandage and completion of the procedure without complications. Please provide nutrition via the inserted nasogastric feeding tube for the next 12 days and then perform X-ray gavage. The patient received Unacid 3 g intravenously as a single shot intraoperatively.","Laryngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Provox prosthesis, Panendoscopy

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment was recommended. Immediately preoperatively, sonography revealed a cN0 neck status. CT showed no evidence of distant metastasis. In the case of a preoperatively determined implant fracture following cervical spine surgery, the procedure regarding positioning was discussed with the trauma surgery and neurosurgery colleagues on several occasions. Positioning within the natural range of motion was classified as safe.","After preparing and positioning the patient, the PEG is first inserted. Insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-laryngoscopy into the stomach. Excellent diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. Then careful positioning with moderate hyperextension, starting with transoral tumor resection. First perform pharyngoscopy. An exophytic, exulcerous tumor is seen in the right paramedian soft palate. This infiltrates the soft palate completely. Only small remnants on the left side, growth into the soft palate dorsally. However, no dorsal mucosal perforation. On the right side, circumscribed infiltration of the upper tonsil pole and the posterior palatal arch. Otherwise, no further extension by palpation and inspection. The tumor is now resected with a macroscopic safety margin of approx. 1.5 cm. Resection of the tumor macroscopically clearly in toto. When releasing the soft palate, good control of the posterior surface is also possible, here too maintaining the safety distance. Isolation to the upper tonsil pole, subtotal removal of the anterior palatal arch. Partial resection of the posterior palatal arch. This safely resects the carcinoma. If the upper pole of the tonsil is infiltrated, the tonsillectomy is performed using the classic dissection technique. Removal of the tonsil at the lower tonsil pole. Certainly no tumor growth here. The tumor is sent as a thread-marked specimen for frozen section diagnostics and is diagnosed here as a squamous cell carcinoma resected in sano. The result was an almost total soft palate defect with a defect in the area of the tonsil lobe, therefore a graft defect measuring up to 10 x 6 cm was measured. Multiple checks and, in the event of blood dryness, initially turning to neck dissection on the left side. A very short neck is seen. Difficult visualization conditions due to lack of hyperextensibility with short anatomical relationships. Skin incision submandibularly and at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure and later ligation of the external jugular vein with a very oblique course. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical artery, the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. Careful free preparation. Level 2 shows a slightly enlarged but non-adherent lymph node measuring approx. 2 x 1 cm in the area of the jugulo-facial angle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Evacuation of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and evacuation of level 5 with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches and caudal protection of the lymph vessel structures. Final inspection. In dry conditions after resection of the neck dissection en bloc. In dry conditions, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Repositioning and parallel neck dissection of the right side and elevation of the radialis graft from the left forearm. First turn to the neck dissection. Correspondingly to the opposite side, make the skin incision. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of a distal part of the strong external jugular vein, which tapers significantly towards the submandibular region. Preservation of the vessel. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. The anterior region shows clear scarring in this case following transcervical cervical spine surgery. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of a deep facial vein branch. Exposure of the very slender superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and the cervical artery. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Several macroscopically enlarged lymph nodes are visible in levels 2 and 3. Also non-adherent visualization of the accessorius nerve. Release of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and release of level 5 with careful protection of the cervical plexus structures. Overall, difficult preparation conditions on both sides due to the anatomical conditions and the difficult positioning. After careful inspection with dry wound conditions, the digastric muscle is resected. Exposure of the carotid bulb and the division of the carotid artery. Exposure of the external carotid artery with the superior thyroid artery, facial artery and occipital artery. Cranial dissection along the artery. Exposure of the styloid under enoral inspection. Performing the pharyngotomy in the area of the tonsil lobe on the right. Widening of the pharyngotomy under control of the vascular nerve structures. However, creation of a tunnel a good two transverse fingers wide. Subsequent insertion of the radialis graft without any problems. To lift the radialis graft. After marking the graft with a special soft palate configuration. Perform the tourniquet. Cut around the graft. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle, a right constant cephalic vein does not exist here. Expose, secure and protect the superficial radial nerve ramus. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle. Deposition after ligation, strictly subfascial release. Exposure of the flexor carpi ulnar. Strictly subfascial dissection with clipping of outgoing vessels. After complete elevation of the graft, isolate the vascular pedicle. A relatively stable larger vein can be visualized in the cranial part of the graft. This is dissected proximally to the specimen and opens into the cupital vein. There is a strong bridge between the accompanying veins of the radial artery and the cupital system, which is why the vein is included. The very slender anterior interosseous artery must be clipped. Securing the ulnar artery. A very strong vessel here. Isolate the graft on a strong cupital vein and the radial artery. Reopening of the tourniquet. Immediate regular graft and hand perfusion. Meticulous hemostasis and, after removal of the graft, removal of the full-thickness skin graft from the groin and careful two-layer wound closure. A vacuum sealing dressing is then applied and the stretcher splint is placed in the functional position. For full-thickness skin harvesting from the left groin. For this purpose, cutting of a 12 x 6 cm full-thickness skin graft with strict cutaneous elevation. Subcutaneous undermining and mobilization and strong multi-layer wound closure under moderate tension after insertion of a 10 Redon drain. Now turn to the insertion of the graft. After placing sutures in the area of the dorsal soft palate and towards the nasopharynx, insertion of the graft. The situation here is somewhat difficult with a relatively thick subcutaneous fat layer. Overall, however, a good fit. Complete coverage of the tonsil lobe and the soft palate defect. If the conditions are intact, turn to the vascular anastomosis. Conditioning of the graft vessels. In comparison, the artery is most likely to be equivalent in caliber to the facial artery. Therefore preparation of the vessel. Deposition after clipping. Careful conditioning of the facial artery and somewhat more difficult with a relatively small vessel, but finally good and sufficient anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. After reopening, immediate venous return and regular graft perfusion. Due to the positioning, the caudally very strong external jugular vein appears to be well suited for conditioning the vein cranial clipping, there is good flow on the vein, therefore preparation for anastomosis. Measurement of a size 4.0 coupler and problem-free performance of the venous anastomosis with the coupler system. After reopening the clamps, immediate regular graft perfusion and regular pedicle pulsation. After checking the wound, insertion of a 10 Redon drain. Splinting of the drainage with 3.0 Vicryl and careful two-layer wound closure. Multiple enoral inspections of the graft and, in the case of regular vitality with slim enoral conditions, no tracheotomy and completion of the procedure after the patient had been repositioned without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT2 oral cavity carcinoma intraoperative reactive lymphadenopathy differential diagnosis cN+ neck status. Depending on the histological findings, planning of adjuvant therapy if necessary. Postoperative meticulous flap monitoring by enoral inspection. Avoidance of pressure dressings, especially on the right cervical side in the case of vein anastomization to the external jugular vein. The patient received intraoperative i.V. antibiotics with Sobelin 600 mg for penicillin allergy; please continue this for 24 hours postoperatively. If the graft heals properly, a gradual diet can be started from the 8th postoperative day.","Transoral resection with defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Neck dissection, PEG placement

The findings were discussed in detail with the patient preoperatively.,"Anesthesia induction by the anesthesia colleagues and performance of a rigid tracheoscopy using O° optics. Inconspicuous conditions in the area of the trachea up to the carina. Subsequent transoral endotracheal intubation using a laser tube, tube fixation and positioning of the patient by the surgeon. A flexible oesophagogastroscopy is then performed using an endoscope, which is advanced to the stomach under visualization. Slightly polypoid mucosal changes in the area of the entire stomach in the sense of chronic gastritis, otherwise no evidence of an exophytic mass or unstable mucosal changes. Endoscopic inversion and inspection of the esophageal junction, inconspicuous conditions there. Then withdraw the endoscope and inspect the esophagus. Inconspicuous conditions there. Then perform a rigid pharyngo- and laryngoscopy using a Kleinsasser C-tube. The posterior wall of the hypopharynx and the esophageal entrance, the piriform sinuses on both sides, the posterior wall of the oropharynx and the side walls were also unremarkable. The base of the tongue was unremarkable on endoscopy and palpation. The endolarynx was then adjusted using a Kleinsasser C-tube. In the area of the right vocal fold, an exophytic mass covered with rough mucosa was found, starting directly anterior to the vocal process and extending posteriorly to the anterior commissure, but leaving out the anterior part of the left vocal fold, thus cT1a glottic laryngeal carcinoma on the right. Set the laser beam to 4 watts in continuous mode and successively move around the glottic change at a wide distance. The specimen is removed in toto and sent in for final histology with a suture marker (anteriorly towards the anterior commissure). Four marginal samples were taken (supraglottic towards the pocket fold, subglottic slope, posterior towards the vocal process, anterior towards the anterior commissure), which are sent for intraoperative frozen section examination. The intraoperative frozen section examination reveals in situ carcinoma in the marginal sample ""supraglottic towards the pocket fold"" as well as chronic inflammatory changes in the marginal sample ""subglottic slope"" (still requiring clarification there). A resection is therefore performed in the supraglottic area (""supraglottic resection"") and a second marginal sample is taken there (""2nd supraglottic marginal sample""). The same procedure is followed in the subglottis. A post-resectate is taken there (""post-resectate subglottis"") and a second subglottic marginal sample (""2nd marginal sample subglottis"") is taken. Hemostasis using swabs soaked in Suprarenin. Repeated inspection and administration of SDH 250 mg intravenously. Removal of all laryngeal swabs and completion of the procedure under dry conditions. Conclusion: This was a transoral, microlaryngoscopic laser-assisted tumor resection of a cT1a G2 squamous cell carcinoma of the right vocal fold. Please note final histology and schedule a follow-up microlaryngoscopy in 8 weeks.","Transoral microlaryngoscopic laser resection

Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery is indicated. There is already a history of PEG placement in the pre-panendoscopy.","Initial transoral tumor resection: insertion of reinforced retractors and placement of the tumor. The carcinoma, which is located in the middle to posterior third of the tongue, infiltrates into the base of the tongue, submucosally and anteriorly submucosally towards the tip of the tongue. The tumor is removed from all sides with a safety margin of 1.5 - 2 cm. A minimal remnant remains in the area of the tip of the tongue, otherwise the entire tongue, parts of the floor of the mouth with extrinsic musculature and parts of the sublingual glands are removed. Also resection of the lingual nerve. The largest part of the base of the tongue also falls backwards. Tumor is thread-marked for frozen section histology. All edges of the specimen are tumor-free in the frozen section. Thus R0 resection. Now transfer to neck dissection: injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into each side of the neck. First neck dissection on the left: Curved skin incision. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. V. jugularis interna, A. carotis communis, A. carotis interna, externa. Visualization of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. Visualization of a rich venous plexus with connection between the external jugular vein, which is double and also has connections to the internal jugular vein via the facial vein. Subsequent evacuation of level II to V. The submandibular gland is also resected cranially. A tunnel measuring 3 QF is then created from transoral to transcervical. This is followed by neck dissection on the right side. This is carried out in the same way as on the left side, exposing the structures mentioned. The submandibular gland is left in place. Levels II to IV are removed. Then elevation of the radial lobe: Marking of the defect in the appropriate extent and size. Maximum length 10 cm, maximum width 6.5 to 7 cm. Mark the flap and cut around it, first from the ulnar and then from the radial side. The radial artery is clamped with the clamp without cutting it first. Then cut up to the olecranon and expose the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the vascular pedicle. Exposure of the superficial venous system. Overall stable saturation, no drop, constant 100% saturation in the area of the right hand. Subsequent detachment of the flap from the ulnar and radial subfacial side, taking the superficial venous system with it from the radial side. Preservation of the lateral antebrachial nerve. Separation of the radial artery and treatment of this using a puncture ligature and 4-0 prolene distally and proximally. Subsequent elevation of the flap along its deep and superficial pedicle. Outgoing vessels are treated using a clip or bipolar. Connections between the deep and superficial venous system can be visualized and lifted in the crook of the elbow. 2 ends of the cephalic vein can be removed. Likewise the radial artery before the exit of the interosseous artery. The radial vein is removed after confluence in a new division. A vein remains in the area of the brachial or ulnar artery. Flushing of the vessels with heparin solution. Subsequent insertion of the radial artery flap: insertion into the defect. Successive suturing of the flap with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. This is achieved without tension while closing the tongue and floor of mouth defect or base of tongue defect and palatal arch defect. The stalk was passed through the already created tunnel into the left side of the neck. After conditioning the vessels, an arterial anastomosis between the facial and radial arteries was performed using Ethilon 8-0 single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow and good venous return. Subsequent venous anastomosis between an outlet from the bundle between the external jugular vein and the facial vein with connection to the internal jugular vein. Coupler size 3 was used for this, followed by a further anastomosis between the other outlet of the cephalic vein and the remaining external jugular vein using coupler 2.5. Good venous return in each case, positive smear phenomenon. This is followed by careful hemostasis of the entire wound area, irrigation with H202 and Ringer's solution. Subsequently, wound closure in layers on both sides of the neck with insertion of a Redon drain in each case. To cover the wound in the area of the right forearm, a piece of skin measuring approx. 11 x 6 cm was removed from the right groin. After ........... of the skin, the wound is closed in layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. The full-thickness skin is then sutured into the defect. This was successful without tension. The wound towards the crook of the elbow is closed in the typical way in layers. The arm is treated with a hydrogel Mepilex dressing. Loose compress dressing on top. Wrap with a absorbent cotton dressing. Then fit a Cramer splint and wrap the forearm with an elastic bandage. Finally, tracheostoma placement: small Kocher collar incision between the neck incisions. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature, which is split. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped, severed and supplied by means of a puncture ligature. Exposure of the trachea, which is positioned relatively. Extensive skin mobilization to enable better epithelialization. Finally, epithelialization is achieved with relatively little tension in a typical manner. After insertion of the relatively wide Björk flap, insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula is possible without any problems. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue the antibiotic treatment that was started intraoperatively for one week. Patient should be fed via PEG, if necessary after swallowing porridge in approx. 7-10 days. Heparin perfusor 500 E/hour, which was started intraoperatively, should be continued for 5 days. Flap control clinically and by means of Doppler at the sites marked by sutures for 5 days according to the scheme. Overall cT2-3 tongue margin carcinoma on the left, suspicious lymph nodes on both sides.

At the same time, there is a large neck metastasis, which is already seen from the CT image in the vicinity of the primaries; the internal carotid artery lies between the tumor formations. Infiltration of the carotid artery cannot be detected on CT.","Initial consultation with the anesthesiologist. Pharyngoscopy is performed first: The tonsil tumor is seen after insertion of the McIvor blade. This is exophytically limited to the tonsil lobe, but palpation shows deep growth in a cranial and lateral direction and extends to the uvula. Posterior palatal arch also involved. Therefore confirmation of the operation with flap coverage. Placement of the PEG tube in the typical manner. Transoral tumor resection: The tumor is incised on all sides with a safety margin of 1-1.5 cm. The anterior and posterior palatal arches are removed. The soft tissue towards the hard palate is also resected with an appropriate safety margin. The resection also extends deep into the pterygoid muscles. Resection extends to the base of the tongue. Medially up to the posterior pharyngeal wall. The tumor specimen is removed in its entirety. Suture marks are placed. Marginal sample from the uvula and marginal sample from cranial-basal from the soft tissue above the tonsil towards the hard palate. The tumor is resected macroscopically in healthy tissue. However, the frozen section shows tumor infiltrates towards the posterior pharyngeal wall and in almost all areas basally. The marginal specimen of the uvula was healthy. Cranial-basal margin specimen with tumor. The patient is therefore repositioned. Covering of all relevant surgical areas after skin disinfection. Beginning with radical neck dissection on the right: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. A large metastatic conglomerate is visible, which has infiltrated the sternocleidomastoid muscle, runs broadly in the direction of the lower parotid pole and towards the base of the skull, and has infiltrated the internal jugular vein. Depiction of the cervical vascular sheath. The external carotid artery as well as the hypoglossal nerve can only be separated from the metastatic conglomerate and preserved with difficulty. Exposure, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve. The internal carotid artery can be easily dissected during the procedure, as can the vagus nerve. This is relocated in the sense of a neurolysis and re-embedded. The internal jugular vein is infiltrated in the upper area. It is placed caudally and ligated twice. Cranially, the lower parotid pole must also be resected as the metastasis grows to this point. All the muscles of the styloid fan are removed. The styloid process must also be resected. Larger parts of the cervical plexus in the cranial part must be resected together with the deep neck muscles, as must of course the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The accessorius nerve is included in the preparation. The V. facialis and V. thyroidea can be preserved. The submandibular gland is also removed. An infiltration of the parapharyngeal space and growth along the internal carotid artery, hypoglossal nerve and vagus nerve can be seen towards the base of the skull. Soft tissue is removed from here, as well as from the area around the styloid process, which was also resected. Tissue is also removed from the right lower pole of the carotid artery. In the frozen section, infiltrations in the skull base margin sample, i.e. around the internal carotid artery and the large cranial nerves. The internal jugular vein was placed very close to the base of the skull and ligated twice. Infiltration by tumor cells, at least microscopically, is also possible here, but was not specifically confirmed by a sample. The tumor is now resected: the facial, superior thyroid and lingual arteries can be preserved. The hypoglossal nerve is also preserved after visualization. Defect in the area of the pharyngeal wall is visualized. The entire pharyngeal wall is resected, including larger parts of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Extensive resection in the area of the pterygoid muscles, which is also resected up to the level of the tube. A marginal sample is taken from the posterior pharyngeal wall from the level of the tube to the hypopharyngeal entrance and sent in labeled with a suture. A marginal sample is also taken caudal-basally from the area of the pharyngeal musculature at the hypopharyngeal entrance. Marginal sample from the cranial-basal area from the area of the remaining pterygoid muscles. A marginal sample was also taken from the transition from the posterior pharyngeal wall to the posterior palatal arch or nasopharyngeal mucosa area. In addition, a marginal sample was taken from the medial pterygoid muscle, which remained on the mandible and was also inconspicuous macroscopically. Infiltrates in the cranial-basal area in the frozen section. Therefore, another extensive soft tissue resection and marginal sample from the pterygoid muscle area next to the tube as well as a mucosal marginal sample with an extensive soft tissue mantle from the palatal mucosa in the hard palate. No more infiltrates here. Overall, an R1 situation is confirmed in the area of the base of the skull, along the cranial nerves and the internal carotid artery. As a final marginal sample, soft tissue was again removed from the entire area, including the spinal column and transition to the mastoid, and sent in for final diagnosis in order to obtain an overview of the extent of the R1 situation. R1 situation certainly also despite R0 situation after marginal samples in the area of the paratubular soft tissue in the pterygoid muscles and soft tissue remaining there. Overall now large defect from the nasopharynx to the hypopharyngeal entrance. Defect coverage using a radial flap is indicated. The defect is measured, resulting in a flap size of approx. 15x10 cm. Irrigation of the wound area with hydrogen and Ringer's solution and extensive hemostasis. Neck dissection on the left side: Here too, as on the opposite side, evacuation level II to V. The internal and external carotid arteries, internal jugular vein, facial vein, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve and branches of the cervical plexus are all exposed and preserved. The vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and vagus nerve are relocated and re-embedded by means of neurolysis. Level II lymph nodes in the cranial region have to be dissected from the jugular vein, but are not infiltrative there. Nevertheless, lymph node metastases are also clinically present here. Tracheostoma creation: Small Kocher collar incision. Exposure through subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature. Splitting of these. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Undercutting of this, clamping of the same, severing and treatment by means of puncture ligatures. Exposure of the trachea. In the 2nd to 3rd intercartilaginous space, opening of the trachea and creation of a wide pedicled modified Björ flap. This is epithelized in the typical manner. Re-intubation and insertion of an 8 mm Woodbridge tube. Elevation of the forearm flap from the left forearm: Marking of the flap in the required three-dimensional dimension and size. Incision of the flap from ulnar subfascial. Incision in the crook of the elbow. Visualization of the superficial venous system with connection to the deep venous system. Subsequent exposure of the vascular pedicle below the brachioradialis muscle. Then elevation of the flap subfascially from the radial side. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve as far as possible given the size of the flap. Caudal exposure of the V. and A. radialis. After clamping for 10 minutes with good saturation, cut through. Treatment of the stumps using 4.0 Prolene single button sutures. Lift the flap successively along the stalk. Smaller vessels are clipped or bipolar coagulated. Exposure of the interosseous artery in the antecubital fossa. After clamping it for a few minutes, if it is well saturated, it is cut and clipped. Exposure of the entry of the radial artery into the brachial artery. Visualization of the confluence. This is split and not very suitable for anastomosis. Two good venous anastomosis options remain in the area of the cephalic vein. Removal of the flap. Veins are ligated. The brachial artery is supplied with 6.0 Vascufil. Flap is flushed with heparin. Split skin with a thickness of 0.8 mm is removed from the thigh area. Hydrocolloid dressing here. The forearm is primarily closed cranially after extensive hemostasis. Split skin is successively incorporated into the forearm defect. A Vacuseal dressing is applied over this in the typical manner. Suction 75 mmHg. Attachment of the arm. The radial artery flap is inserted into the defect. Successive suturing from transoral and transcervical, partly with the sutures in place. The flap can be sutured in place without tension. Replacement of the pharyngeal side wall and posterior pharyngeal wall and palatal arch. Sutured cranially to the tubal cartilage. The stalk is passed below the hypoglossal nerve into the soft tissues of the neck. The regions at the base of the skull showing the R1 situation were marked with clips beforehand. The vessels were then conditioned. The still outgoing V. facialis and V. thyroidea media are selected as connecting vessels. The facial artery is selected and anastomized with the radial artery after conditioning with 9.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and good venous return. The larger cephalic vein is anastomosed to the facial vein with 4.0 couplers after conditioning. Good venous return after opening the clamps. Positive smear phenomenon. The smaller vein is anastomosed with the V. thyroidea media with a 2.5 mm coupler. Good venous return here too. Positive smear phenomenon. Overall good perfusion of the flap. Careful hemostasis and irrigation of the neck. Wound closure in layers on the right with insertion of two flaps. Application of a pressure bandage. Skin closure on the left with insertion of a Redon drain after extensive hemostasis and irrigation. Application of a pressure bandage. The epithelialized tracheostoma is supplied with an 8 mm tracheostomy tube. This is sutured in place. Wound dressing. Completion of the procedure without complications. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist. Conclusion: Overall cT4 tonsillar carcinoma with almost per continuitatem growth or contact with a very large soft tissue metastasis, which in turn showed infiltrations into the skull base or caudal parotid pole. Almost N3 metastasis on the right, total lymph node metastases on both sides. Overall extensive tumor volume, which justified resection to this extent in view of the HPV-positive status. Postoperative RCT indicated as soon as possible. Patient admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Antibiotic treatment, which was started intraoperatively with Unacid 3 g, should be continued for one week. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube, after loosening the next day. Flap control enorally or by Doppler for five days. Heparin perfusor, which was started intraoperatively at 500 units/hour, should be continued for five days. X-ray pre-swallow on the 10th day, then diet build-up if necessary.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Free flap (Radial)

There is now an indication for transoral resection. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.,"After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carrying out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesiologist. Induction of anesthesia. Transition to rigid tracheoscopy. Adjustment of the glottis and passing through it using the 0° optics. The mucosal conditions are unremarkable on all sides up to the exit of the segmental bronchi. The patient is then intubated by the surgeon. Transition to esophagogastroscopy. Insertion of the flexible endoscope under visualization and constant air insufflation into the stomach. This reveals a typical gastric mucosal relief without irritation on all sides. Inversion and inspection of the gastroesophageal junction. This appears unremarkable. After desufflation, slow withdrawal of the endoscope with circular inspection of all sections of the esophagus. There is no evidence of a tumor here. Remove the flexible endoscope. Insertion of the mouth guard. Prior to this, the patient is positioned in head reclination. Enter with the size C small bore tube. Adjustment of the endolarynx. This appears unremarkable. Inspection of the hypopharynx on both sides. Here the piriform sinus is lined with smooth mucosa on all sides up to the tip and can be freely unfolded. Subsequent inspection of the oropharynx. A somewhat uneven mucosa can be seen in the area of the right-sided base of the tongue. This is also biopsied. Primarily no urgent malignant findings. Otherwise unremarkable mucosal conditions in the area of the oropharynx. Inspection of the edge of the tongue on the left side. This shows the partially ulcerated lesion described above in the area of the middle third of the tongue. Subsequent insertion of the Jennings mouth retractor. Snaring of the tongue. Marking of the planned resection margins using the electric needle. Circular cutting around the tumor while maintaining the necessary safety distance. The specimen is then sent in for definitive histology. Clinically macroscopically, this is an in sano resection. Only in the area of the posterior third of the resection does the mucosa still appear slightly leukoplakic. Therefore, a post-resection specimen is taken from the dorsum of the tongue to the dorsal third of the tongue and the floor of the mouth. This preparation is also thread-marked for definitive histology. Injection of carbostesin solution for postoperative analgesia. In addition, inverted suturing of the wound edges with PDS 4.0, resulting in complete readaptation of the tongue edges. Final inspection. If the wound bed is dry, the operation is completed without complications. Removal of the rein suture. Removal of the jenning. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Positioning of the patient. Completion of the operation without complications.","Partial glossectomy and Panendoscopy

No intraoperative evidence of primarius. In the staging performed, CT shows a left-sided tonsil asymmetry with increased enhancement in PET-CT in lateral comparison, otherwise no evidence of primarius or further metastasis. Extensive metastasis on CT with extension into the parapharyngeal space. Sonographic cN3 neck status. Now indication for completion of the CUP diagnosis and resection of the extensive metastasis on the left side.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesiology colleagues, the patient is first positioned and then the small water tube is inserted under dental protection. After inspection of the inconspicuous oral vestibule. The oral cavity is inconspicuous. In the area of the oropharynx, the tonsils are scarred and cryptic on both sides, slight asymmetry in favor of the left side, but no exophytic tumor. The base of the tongue is seen on the left side with questionable slight tissue plus, otherwise macroscopically not suspicious. The rest of the oropharynx is unremarkable and clear, as are the endolarynx and the hypopharynx, which is slightly edematous and cannot be fully adjusted due to the physiognomy, but is clear as far as can be assessed. Inconspicuous postcricoid region. Corresponding to the diagnostic imaging, a diagnostic tonsillectomy is now performed on the left side and, in the case of slightly raised findings in the area of the base of the tongue, a representative biopsy of the base of the tongue is taken. Tonsillectomy performed using the classic dissection technique. Significant scarring of the tonsil capsule, but rather no tumor growth, therefore initially no resection towards the parapharyngeal space due to the extensive metastasis. Protection of the parauvular mucosal triangle and the posterior palatal arch and removal of the tonsil in toto. Careful hemostasis. Inspection of the tonsil after removal reveals an exophytic change after opening in the area of the cranial tonsil pole or here in the area of the crypts, which is highly suspicious, so the specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section diagnostics. This confirms the clinical suspicion of a tonsillar carcinoma, CIS forming margins in the area of the cranial pole, otherwise an R0 situation at all levels. Therefore, complete resection of the cranial tonsil ........., partly with soft palate-parauvular tissue and upper part of the posterior palatal arch. Complete imaging margin specimen. In the frozen section diagnostics, this is again completely tumor-free, therefore safe R0 resection here. The sample taken from the base of the tongue was tumor-free. In the meantime, the PEG was inserted. This was done with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy to see through to the stomach. This was inconspicuous and clear. With good diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. On reflection, the esophagus is clear and unremarkable. We now turn to the neck dissection. A coarse, moderately displaceable mass measuring clinically approx. 8 x 8 cm with clear infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is seen. The skin incision is now made from the mastoid to the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose and cut through the platysma. This is clearly not infiltrated. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the caudal part. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. The cranial part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is completely infiltrated up to just before the mastoid insertion. Ligation and removal of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Separation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the level of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure and dissection of the internal jugular vein. Overall, significantly more difficult preparation conditions due to the patient's physiognomy. It can now be seen that the metastasis surrounds the cervical vascular sheath by approx. 180° and clearly extends to level V a. Here, subtotal infiltration of the cervical plexus, as well as infiltration of the phrenic nerve and the border cord. In addition, infiltration of the paravertebral musculature. En bloc resection here of the metastasis. Separation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the mastoid. Separation of the internal jugular vein. Anterior free dissection and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. The facial vein is removed during infiltration. Dissection of the caudal parotid pole. This works well. No infiltration here. There is now a circumscribed infiltration of the posterior digastric venter muscle. This is also generously resected. Infiltration of the barely visible hypoglossal nerve. Complete infiltration of the accessorius nerve. Now dissection directly onto the common carotid artery. Exposure and securing of the vagus nerve. Shortly after the exit of the superior thyroid artery, the external carotid artery is seen to be infiltrated. This is also removed. Removal of the infiltrated branch of the facial artery. Resection of the metastasis cranially up to the transverse process of the atlas and close to the spinal column, but here still covering the muscle layer. No tumor growth cranial to the digastric muscle, so that the metastasis can be removed in toto without opening the pharynx. Careful hemostasis. Evacuation of level V a and b remnants. Finally, no evidence of lymphatic leakage. Protection of the transverse cervical artery. Extensive wound irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution and, if the wound is absolutely dry, insertion of two 10-gauge Redon drains if the wound area is extensive. Subsequent careful, two-layer wound closure. Final enoral inspection, in this case dry conditions. To further reduce the pharyngo-cervical fistula, the posterior and anterior palatal arch is adapted using 3-0 Vicryl mucosal sutures. Completion of the procedure with slim mucosa conditions. Conclusion: Intraoperatively histologically confirmed cT1 cN3 G2 R0 left tonsillar carcinoma. Please leave the Redon drains in place for at least 3 days due to the extensive wound cavity and plan adjuvant radiochemotherapy promptly.","Tonsillectomy, Neck dissection, PEG placement

Exposure of the internal jugular vein, the facial vein, the posterior digastric venter muscle and the accessorius nerve. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the accessory nerve. Now dissection of the posterior triangle of the accessory nerve from cranial to caudal, sparing the accessory nerve. Dissection along the vein, after exposing the vagus nerve caudally and depositing in the area of the omohyoid muscle. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve. Some larger lymph nodes are conspicuous, but clinically no evidence of metastasis. Now visualization of the external and internal carotid arteries and the hypoglossal nerve. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve. Dissection of the anterior neck preparation. Smaller veins repeatedly tear, even directly in the area of the internal jugular vein. This therefore has to be stitched twice. No more bleeding. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and the cervical vein, which is left in place. Removal of the capsule of the submandibular gland. Extensive hemostasis with H2O2 swabs and bipolar coagulation. No more bleeding. Insertion of a Redon drainage. Subcutaneous suture, skin suture, pressure bandage. Neck dissection of the left side: A lymph node metastasis was also clinically described in the preliminary findings. Skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the muscle. Overall, recurrent bleeding and abundant vascularization. Difficult dissection conditions. After exposure of the muscle, exposure of the internal jugular vein. The accessorius nerve can be visualized in depth. Dissection of the common carotid artery, the vagus nerve and the internal and external carotid artery cranially and caudally. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve. Exposure of the digastric venter posterior muscle and dissection of the accessorius triangle. A large cystic lymph node metastasis can be seen here, starting directly under the accessorius nerve. Further lymph nodes are also removed from the accessorius triangle. Dissection is performed along the vein and vagus nerve as well as the common carotid artery from cranial to caudal, down to below the omohyoid muscle. The caudal edge of the sedimentation is stitched several times with Vicryl sutures to prevent a fistula. Now further dissection of the jugular vein anteriorly. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve. Dissection of the anterior part of the neck, removal of the capsule of the submandibular gland and dissection from cranial to caudal. This results in a complete neck dissection. No bleeding. Irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Minor oozing bleeding is stopped with bipolar coagulation. Insertion of a Redon drain. Subcutaneous suture, skin suture and pressure bandage. Another check of the primary resection with the small water tube: there is no major bleeding here. No swelling either. It is therefore decided not to tracheotomize the patient in the first instance. The patient is extubated and transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Detailed consultation with the anesthesia department regarding the further procedure.

Air insufflation and identification of the anterior wall of the stomach. Perform a positive diaphanoscopy and then place the PEG tube in the area of the lateral canal in the usual manner using the thread pull-through method. Aspiration of air and subtle retraction of the endoscope with constant air insufflation. Neck dissection on the right: Start with neck dissection on the right side using a skin incision in the area of the old scar. Separation of the cutaneous-subcutaneous tissue and identification of the platysma. Overall, extremely scarred conditions are seen here following neck dissection and radiotherapy. In consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, it was decided not to proceed with the neck dissection. One reason is the current ycN0 neck status, the scarred conditions and, in particular, a possible secondary microvascular defect reconstruction of the tongue. Therefore, no further action is taken and the wound is closed again. After appropriate preparation, first insert the retractors and dislodge the tongue at the fixation suture. Then look at the tumor located medially in the posterior third, which extends a little further to the right than to the opposite side by palpation. Start resection at the anterior left margin. Here, the tumor is successively removed through the healthy musculature at an appropriate safety distance using the monopolar caustic technique. First, resection is performed on the left edge of the tumor in order to preserve the lingual artery, which is ultimately successful. The tumor is then successively removed from the left side through the muscles of the inner tongue. A sufficient safety margin can also be maintained in the area of the base of the tongue. The resection is somewhat more extensive on the right side, but a narrow strip of tissue remains in the area of the base of the tongue. Careful hemostasis by bipolar coagulation. On inspection of the resectate, the left anterior tumor resection margin is slightly less distant at the same side as the tumor. Therefore, a resection is performed on the tongue. Subsequently, marginal samples are taken from the entire circumference at the base of the tumor for a frozen section histological examination. These all proved to be tumor-free, so that an R0 resection can be assumed. Although the subsequent defect is extensive, it does not infiltrate particularly deeply, largely preserving the base of the tongue, so that no construction is necessary. Neck dissection can also be dispensed with in the case of cN0 status and previous neck dissection on both sides. Removal of the instruments without tooth damage and transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Transoral tumor resection of the median-dorsal tongue tumor. Intraoperative rapid section histologic R0 resection. No neck dissection in the case of previous neck dissection due to the nasopharyngeal carcinoma and primary reconstruction due to the configuration of the defect","Transoral Tumor Resection, PEG placement

There is a tumor that covers the entire palatal arch area from the upper tonsillar lobe on the right to the left side. Growth also on the back. No growth into the tube. However, growth also in the direction of the hard palate. Overall flap coverage indicated. Radialis flap not possible for vascular reasons, as Allen test not sufficient on both sides and other diagnostics likewise. Upper arm flap and other usual flap plasty not possible due to the required pedicle length. It was therefore decided to cover the defect with a latissimus dorsi flap together with the maxillofacial surgeon.","The patient is first taken to the operating room and prepared by the anesthesia colleagues. Tracheotomy: Horizontal skin incision at the level of the cricoid. Separation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Identification of the infralaryngeal musculature and division of the musculature in the midline. Sharp dissection of the cricoid cartilage. Identification of the thyroid isthmus and undermining of the isthmus with a clamp. Separation of the isthmus after bipolar coagulation and identification of the anterior tracheal wall. Creation of a visor tracheotomy between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma in the usual manner and insertion of a 9-gauge cannula. Subsequent attempt at PEG insertion. PEG insertion not possible, therefore secondary insertion by surgical or internal medicine colleagues if diaphanoscopy is insufficient. Subsequent transoral tumor resection. Positioning of the head. Insertion with the McIvor oral spatula. Successive resection of the tumor with a safety margin of 1 to 1.5 cm on all sides. Here too, the mucosa is first pushed away from the hard palate, the palatal bone is already resected in the marginal area. The entire tonsil with the adjacent palatal arch area falls from left to right. The tumor is successfully removed in toto with a macroscopic safety margin on all sides. The tumor is thread-marked. A marginal sample is taken from the mucosal area in the posterior palatal arch at the border to the vomer. The specimen and marginal sample are sent for frozen section. In the frozen section, according to the pathology department, there is still a CIS in the caudal region on both sides, i.e. in the area of the mucosa below the tonsil lobe. Equally uncertain situation with CIS that cannot be ruled out in the area of the marginal sample in the direction of the vomer. Therefore, extensive resection of a mucosal strip in the area of the mucosal transition from the lower tonsil pole towards the hypopharynx. This is done from both sides, whereby the marginal samples are sent in 2 parts. Likewise, clear resection with further removal of the vomer and subsequent resection of the soft tissue behind and below it. All soft tissue and bone parts are sent for frozen section. No more carcinoma in situ infiltrates detectable here. Therefore now R0 resection. Neck dissection on the right side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Exposure of the platysma and subplatysmal blunt dissection. Finding the external jugular vein. This is extremely thick and has a bifurcation. Ligation of the medial part and preservation and retraction of the lateral part. Dissection of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and identification of the omohyoid muscle. Dissection along this and exposure of the submandibular muscle. Elevation of the submandibular glenoid with the Langenbeck and lateral dissection on the digastric muscle. Identification of the accessorius nerve and preservation of this. Now dissect the cervical vascular sheath and dissect the internal jugular vein cranially. Preservation of the facial nerve and finding and preserving the hypoglossal nerve. Now successive removal of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the accessorius nerve and the plexus branches. Identification of the vagus nerve and protection of this. Now also successive removal of the medial neck preparation. There is no evidence of bleeding. Insertion of a Redon drainage and two-layer wound closure. Neck dissection on the left side through <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Separation of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the platysma. Subplatysmal dissection of a skin flap. Identification of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. The nerve can be pushed upwards and preserved, the external jugular vein is ligated and cut. Dissection along the sternocleidomastoid muscle in depth with constant use of bipolar coagulation. Identification of the deep cervical fascia and the plexus branches of the cervical plexus as well as the accessorius nerve. Identification of the omohyoid muscle and dissection along the muscle medially to the hyoid bone. Identification of the posterior digastric venter muscle and dissection along the muscle anteriorly to the hyoid bone. The cervical lymph node regions II, III and IV as well as I b are removed after free dissection of the submandibular gland and removal of the surrounding lymph nodes. The neurovascular structures can be preserved. No major bleeding and no injury to the accessorius nerve. For the planned flap anastomosis, the superior thyroid artery is conditioned and dissected free and the internal jugular vein is dissected free in a circular fashion. The latissimus dorsi flap is then removed. First position the patient so that the left latissimus dorsi flap can be removed accordingly. (<CLINICIAN_NAME>, maxillofacial surgery). The flap is then removed and a vascular connection is made, also by the anesthesia colleagues. Skin closure in the cervical area on both sides in a typical manner with insertion of a Redon drain in each case. Careful hemostasis and irrigation beforehand. Further inspection of the flap enorally. This is vital. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the Medical Intensive Care Unit 1 for monitoring. Please continue antibiotic treatment with Unacid, which was started intraoperatively, for 1 week. Flap control according to the scheme for 5 days. Nutrition via the intraoperatively inserted gastric tube. Please arrange for a PEG to be inserted at intervals by the surgical or anesthesia colleagues once the wound has healed.

The immediate preoperative ultrasound showed a cN2c neck status with questionable infiltration of the internal jugular vein.","First perform a pharyngoscopy. Insertion of the open mouth retractors. An exophytic tumor can be seen in the area of the anterior palatal arch, sitting on the ascending mandibular branch, coarsely caked here and rather difficult to move. Growth to parauvular. The tonsillar lodge is used up, also clear infiltration of the posterior palatal arch. Growth continues over the glossotonsillar groove into the edge of the tongue, which is also circumscribed towards the posterior floor of the mouth and extends to approx. 3 cm in the area of the edge of the tongue as well as clear infiltration of the base of the tongue to approx. 1/4. Caudally in the area of the pharyngeal side wall, the tumor extends caudally to about the level of the oropharyngeal border. Epiglottis, vallecula and supraglottic region are free. The posterior wall of the oropharynx is also free. Now resection of the tumor transorally with the electric knife and using the dissection technique. Resection hard to parauvular while maintaining a safety margin of at least 1-1.5 cm. Removal of the entire anterior palatal arch, resection up to the buccal. Resection of the posterior palatal arch en bloc, in the area of the ascending mandibular branch here periosteal growth, but no infiltration. Infiltration of medial pterygoid muscles, therefore now exposure of the mandibular bone in the area of the ascending mandibular branch, pushing off the periosteum here with the raspatory. Resection of the posterior floor of the mouth and the edge of the tongue. Here too, maintaining a safety margin of at least 1 to 1.5 cm on all sides. Resection up to the base of the tongue and, in the case of resection in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth, exposure of the submandibular gland enorally after detachment of the tumor from the posterior pharyngeal wall. After complete detachment, the tumor is now left in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth and the base of the tongue, and the decision is made to proceed transcervically with better local control. Later, the parts of the lower jaw close to the tumor are also trimmed with the rose bur. Covering samples are now taken from the edges of the tongue, the posterior floor of the mouth, the soft palate and the buccal mucosa. These are assessed as completely tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Now repositioning and turning to the neck dissection with tumor resection on the right side. Skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and the auricularis magnus nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. Exposure and free dissection of the internal jugular vein, careful dissection here. A clearly caked lymph node conglomerate can now be seen in the area of the venofacial angle. The facial vein itself is only very weakly developed and must be removed in the area of the metastases. Otherwise, there are no other internal jugular veins. The jugular vein is not infiltrated after careful dissection. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery. Expose the hypoglossal nerve. Now expose the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and clearing of level Vb with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Subcapsular release of the submandibular gland. Resection of the digastric muscle, subtotal removal of the gland and thus performance of the pharyngotomy. The pharyngotomy is opened in the anterior region of the resection margins. Now reopen the mouth retractor and perform a combined resection towards the base of the tongue caudally to the vallecula and from the outside to the level of the hyoid. The tongue base resection is now separated from the cranial oropharyngeal resection for a better overview. Now turn back to the neck. It quickly becomes apparent that all branches of the external carotid artery and the cranial thyroid artery lead to the tumor. The facial and lingual arteries are therefore ligated, as is the maxillary artery. The internal carotid artery is now separated together with the vagus nerve from the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle up to the level of the styloid process and thus safely spared. Using the styloid process as a landmark, the entire lateral pharyngeal musculature is resected from caudal to cranial up to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Now repeat the procedure enorally. The styloid process can also be identified here and serve as a guide for the resection. In the end, a 5 cm resectate is created. Due to the large wound area, 3 separate marginal samples are taken from the wound bed. In addition to the posterior pharyngeal wall central margin sample and the vallecula and hyoid margin samples. These are later all assessed as tumor-free. Therefore, an intraoperative R0 resection can be assumed here. Finally, as described above, the areas of growth close to the periosteum in the area of the ascending alveolar ridge are removed with the drill. Moderate connection conditions now remain on the right side in the area of the right external jugular vein and the remaining superior thyroid artery. Therefore, after previously measuring a graft adapted for the soft palate, tongue, tongue edge and floor of the mouth with a total area of 11 x 8 cm, a radial graft is lifted with special consideration of the posterior floor of the mouth and the edge of the tongue with the possibility of bilateral connection. Therefore, the radial flap is now lifted in parallel. Unwrap the arm and apply the tourniquet. After marking the graft, cut around the graft. Exposure and securing of the cephalic vein. Perform the same maneuver and expose the radial superficial ramus nerve. These can be completely spared. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle and the cephalic vein. A skin monitor is not used in the course of potential bilateral anastomosis. Exposure of the radial veins, these are relatively slender distally. Blunt exposure Ligation of the distal vascular pedicle. Release of the distal vascular pedicle. Now strictly subfascial dissection. Further release of the graft. Circumscribed visible ulnar artery, but no further dissection and safe protection. Now complete subfascial elevation of the graft, exposing a cancerous bridge between the radial vein and cephalic vein in the area of the crook of the elbow. Salvage of this bridge, clipping of outgoing venous branches. Exposure of the radial artery before the exit of the very strong and significantly larger ulnar artery; a true anterior interosseous artery is not found here. Marking of the artery and reopening of the tourniquet. After a total of 90 minutes, minute hemostasis, regular flap perfusion and preparation for subsequent flap elevation. After graft displacement, an 11 x 8 cm piece of full-thickness skin is removed from the groin. In the groin area, after strict cutaneous elevation, subcutaneous mobilization and, if the wound is dry, placement of a 10-gauge Redon drainage and careful, strong, two-layer wound closure and later incorporation of the full-thickness skin graft and here, after careful wound inspection, two-layer wound closure. Complete incorporation of the full-thickness skin graft in this case with a complex flap, therefore somewhat more difficult incorporation conditions, but finally sufficient closure, application of a vacuum seal and application of the Kramer splint in the usual manner. At the same time, the neck dissection was performed on the left side. To do this, also make a skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the playtsma. Creation of a platysma flap, exposure of the external jugular vein, which is very narrow here, and the auricular nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical artery and the very slender superior thyroid artery. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure and free preparation of the internal jugular vein. A macroscopically conspicuous lymph node measuring approx. 2 x 1.5 cm without infiltration of neighboring structures can be seen in the area of the jugulofacial angle. V. facialis is relatively weakly developed here, but is preserved. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Careful release of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and release of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Finally, dry wound conditions and no evidence of lymph leakage in level V. After wound irrigation with Ringer's solution, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure with primary graft connection attempt on the right side. Now perform a plastic tracheotomy. To do this, make a horizontal skin incision sparingly to avoid a possible connection to the cervical resection areas. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Cut through the infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Bipolar coagulation of the very thin thyroid isthmus. Further exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring: creation of a broad-based pedunculated Björk flap. Incision of the tracheostoma with mucocutaneous anastomosis and subsequent problem-free intubation onto an LE tube. Later reintubation onto an 8-gauge cannula with inner core, which is fixed by suturing. Now, after recovery of the graft, incorporation of the graft transenorally. In this case, with significant tongue swelling and edematous conditions, relatively difficult insertion conditions. Laborious reconstruction of the soft palate and suturing in the area of the cheek soft tissue, the posterior floor of the mouth and the edge of the tongue. Overall, however, a good fit. Finally, transcervical suturing of the base of the tongue and the lateral pharyngeal wall. Finally, tight conditions and sufficient flap detachment. Now condition the vessels by free preparation of the cubital subcutaneous veins carried out in the evening. Now a good opportunity for adequate pedicle positioning. Careful fixation of the pedicle peripherally with Vicryl sutures. Separation of the superior thyroid artery after peripheral clipping. Here after opening good flow. Conditioning of the vessels and anastomosis with 8.8 Ethilon in relatively equal caliber conditions. This is initially successful. However, there is now a marked vulnerability in the area of both vessels. There are several tears in the vessels, so that a stable and tight anastomosis cannot be achieved despite several attempts at suturing. Therefore excision of the anastomosis. The flap artery and the superior thyroid artery are shortened and a new vascular anastomosis is performed. This is successful despite difficult suture conditions. Immediate regular venous return with good flap perfusion. Venous return is strong, but only via one of the two elevated cubital veins. Therefore clipping of the 2nd vein. Conditioning of the external jugular vein, which is thrombosed in the meantime, therefore shortening of the vein. Free preparation continued, irrigation with heparin. Finally, good flow and clear conditions. After removal of a thrombus, careful irrigation and sizing of a 2.5 mm coupler and subsequent problem-free venous anastomosis with the coupler. A well-positioned pedicle with relatively stable conditions and excellent flap perfusion enorally is now evident, so that careful two-layer wound closure with a caudally extended flap is now performed and the procedure is completed at this point. Conclusion: Due to the intraoperative extension cT3 cN2c oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right with R0 situation macroscopically and in the frozen section diagnosis. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 c. Postoperative regular enoral flap vitality control in the absence of a skin monitor. Due to the venous anastomosis located directly subcutaneously on the right side at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, strict attention must be paid to avoiding pressure bandages or similar. Depending on the endoscopy findings, diet build-up and, if necessary, decannulation are possible from the 8th postoperative day.","Tumor resection, Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial)

Secondary diagnosis: Post clear cell renal cell carcinoma on the right (nephrectomy <2012>).","After induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia department, transoral endotracheal intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Positioning of the patient for TE on the left. Dental status determined. Insertion of the McIvor oral spatula. The left tonsil is superficially unremarkable, no exophytic mass, but caudally marked induration. This finding is taken into account during the subsequent resection according to the demo and discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Now incision of the anterior palatal arch on the left, taking it along and intramuscular, step-by-step dissection in the caudal direction using the dissection technique. No evidence of major vascular bleeding under dissection technique. The dissection procedure is performed according to the instructions of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The tonsil is coarse in the caudal direction, for this reason resection with a safety margin of approx. 1 cm and thus resection of part of the left tongue base. The macroscopically resected specimen in sano is thread-marked (cranial margin of resection, caudal margin of resection, tongue margin, caudal margin of resection, glossotonsillar groove) and sent for frozen section examination. During this time, a PEG was inserted (described below in the report). Result of the frozen section examination: 2 cm large squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil. Cranial margin forming. Caudal resection in the area of the base of the tongue at a maximum of 1 mm with partial coagulation artifacts. Renewed demonstration of findings <CLINICIAN_NAME> and decision to carry out resections at exactly the above-mentioned sites and then to take marginal samples for frozen section examination. Thus generous resection of these sites by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The resections are sent for final histology. Then representative marginal samples are taken from the above-mentioned sites, which are sent for frozen section. These then show no malignancy. Thus R0-resected T2 tonsillar carcinoma on the left. With now extensive defect from parauvular over the soft palate to caudal to the base of the tongue, renewed demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>, hemostasis using bipolar, finally 2 adjacent sutures to suture over the lateral pharyngeal wall through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. No more evidence of bleeding. No fatty tissue from the lateral pharyngeal wall. Operation completed without complications. Dental status fixed. All swabs complete. No bleeding. Report on PEG placement (see above): Insertion of the flexible esophagogastroscope under bite guard and constant air insufflation, the esophageal mucosa is free on all sides and without irritation, no mass. In the stomach, air insufflation and regular unfolding of the inconspicuous mucosal relief. Clearly visible positive diaphanoscopy. Now placement of a PEG tube using the thread pull-through method in the typical manner, approx. 2 transverse fingers below the costal arch. The patient received 3 g Unacid i.v. perioperatively. A PEG tube was inserted without any problems. Conclusion: R0-resected T2 tonsillar carcinoma on the left in a frozen section after left neck dissection with pN2b neck status (2/23) and placement of a PEG tube. Significantly larger tumor size intraoperatively in contrast to the initial findings. Procedure: Planning of a neck dissection on the right and, depending on swallowing function and local findings, if necessary, defect coverage of the large oropharyngeal defect that has now developed (see above) using a microvascular anastomosed flap graft.

The last biopsy <2018> revealed a G3 differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in a biopsy of the left anterior vocal fold. Due to the lack of exposure of the anterior commissure, there is now an indication for a partial laryngectomy from the outside. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation. As part of the preoperative CT scan, cT1 cN0 glottic carcinoma on the left. Additional findings: cerebellar mass. This still needs to be clarified by magnetic resonance imaging in the interval.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carrying out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. Induction of anesthesia and intubation of the patient. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon. Insertion of the mouthguard. Insertion of the size D Kleinsasser tube. First, adjustment of the endolarynx. A scar is visible in the area of the left anterior third of the vocal fold. The anterior commissure is extremely difficult to adjust. Using the O° view, a slightly uneven area of mucosa can be seen in the area of the anterior vocal fold with a transition to the anterior commissure. Endolaryngeal laser resection does not appear to be a sensible option. Therefore, as discussed with the patient in advance, remove the Kleinsasser tube and proceed to chordectomy via a thyrofissure. First reposition the patient. Skin spray disinfection and infiltration anesthesia. Abjoration of the surgical site and sterile draping. Clear identification of the thyroid incissure and the level of the cricoid cartilage. Marking of the planned incision using the broken line technique. Sharp cutting of the cutis as well as the subcutis. Insertion of the sharp retractor. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Separation of the same in the area of the linea alba. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage. Incision of the perichondrium in the median line and formation of 2 perichondrium lobes. Horizontal incision in the area of the ligamentum conicum. Open the thyroid cartilage strictly in the median line using the wheel. Insertion of the 2-pronged retractor and meticulous inspection of the endolaryngeal findings. This shows the previously detected endoscopically unstable mucosal area in the area of the left anterior third of the vocal fold with transition to the anterior commissure. The 15 mm scalpel is now used to make a circular incision around the mass with an appropriate safety margin. Part of the perichondrium in the area of the anterior commissure is also resected. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for definitive histological processing. In addition, 4 marginal samples are taken (upper left vocal fold, lower left vocal fold, anterior commissure and right anterior commissure). All frozen sections were found to be tumor-free intraoperatively. There was also no evidence of CIS. Since all marginal specimens show the tumor area in a circular fashion, an R0 resection can be assumed. Grinding of the inner cortex in the area of the former left anterior third of the vocal fold. The remaining thyroarytaenoid muscle is preserved. Wound irrigation with H202 and Ringer's solution. Creation of a total of 4 drill holes. Closure of the laryngeal skeleton with PDS 4.0. Closure of the incision in the area of the ligamentum conicum. Suturing of the previously prepared perichondrium leaves. Readaptation of the prelaryngeal musculature. A second layer of prelaryngeal musculature is also stitched laterally over the median line to create a corresponding counterpressure. Finally, insertion of a flap, subcutaneous suture with Vicryl 4-0 and skin suture with Ethilon 5-0. Application of a wound dressing and completion of the operation without complications. Conclusion: This resulted in a chordectomy via a thyrofissure. Intraoperative R0. Preoperative computed tomography findings also cT1c N0. Due to the preoperative sonographic findings in the neck, please monitor closely and present the patient to the tumor conference as standard. With regard to the cerebellar mass, please undergo further magnetic resonance imaging during the inpatient stay.","Chordectomy through thyreofissure

Thus indication for laryngoscopy to plan further treatment.,"First, the patient is induced anesthesia and transoral endotracheal intubation using a laser tube by the anesthesia colleagues. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon. First, laryngoscopy is performed and an attempt is made to adjust the findings. Unfortunately, this was not successful. The decision is therefore made to reorganize the findings in the sense of a partial laryngectomy according to Leroux Robert. Skin spray disinfection, application of local anesthesia in a skin fold at the level of the thyroid cartilage. Skin ablation, sterile draping. Creation of an approx. 6 mm long incision in this skin fold. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Formation of a subplatysmal flap cranially and caudally. Exposure and transection of the prelaryngeal musculature in the midline. Undermining and ligation of some branches of the anterior jugular vein. Exposure of the cricothyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage. Scalpel incision along the thyroid vein. Separation of the perichondrium from the thyroid cartilage, horizontal incision of the cricothyroid vein using a monopolar needle. Median thyroidectomy using a small wire. Opening of the laryngeal lumen and inspection of the findings. Exophytic mass in the area of the anterior third of the left vocal fold and in the area of the anterior commissure. The findings were incised using scissors and 3 marginal samples were sent for intraoperative frozen section examination (left glottis, left subglottis, anterior commissure). Tiny CIS fragments were found in the left glottis margin specimen by the pathology colleague, thus resection in this region. A resection specimen is taken, which is sent for final histology and a second left glottis margin specimen is taken, which is sent for intraoperative frozen section examination. This time the pathology colleague found it to be tumor-free. Thus hemostasis endolaryngeal. Fitting of a size 16 Keel placeholder after drilling holes in the thyroid cartilage. Adjustment of the perichondrium leaves of the thyroid cartilage in the midline. The prelaryngeal musculature is sutured together in the midline. Creation of a flap, prelaryngeal platysma suture. Single button skin suture. Application of a pressure bandage, completion of the procedure without complications. Please plan control MLE and Keel removal in 6 weeks. The patient received intraoperative Clindamy-cin 600 mg intravenously. Please continue antibiotics 4 x daily for the next 7 days.","Laryngoscopy, Frontolateral laryngeal partial resection

Induction of anesthesia and intubation by anesthesia colleagues. Sterile washing and draping. Start of tracheotomy: vertical skin incision for this. Dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Exposure of the linea alba. Push the muscles to the side. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus and coagulation and transection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior tracheal wall and entry into the trachea between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis. Repositioning of the patient, sterile washing and draping. Insertion of the mouth blocker. Inspection of the tumor. The tumor covers the entire soft palate median and paramedian on the right. The tumor is incised with the monopolar needle with a safety margin of 1 - 1.5 cm. Detachment of the tumor from the soft palate and from the anterior and posterior palatal arch, which must be partially resected on both sides. Measure the defect: 7.5 x 6 cm. Parallel neck dissection on both sides and lifting of the radialis graft. Neck dissection on the right side. Skin incision in the usual manner on the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and detachment of the neck preparation II a to V a while preserving the plexus branches. Exposure of the vessels. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery, external artery and external jugular vein and facial vein, which will also be used later for the connection. Neck dissection on the left side. Skin incision also on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the submandibular gland, the omohyoid muscle and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and release of the neck preparation II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. Insertion of a Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. On the left side, the submandibular gland is removed and the digastric muscle is cut to create a breakthrough to the enoral side, where the stalk can later be removed. Sending the tumor to pathology. The frozen section revealed carcinoma in situ on the left side at the anterior edge of the soft palate and at the posterior edge. A large resection was taken at both sites and another margin sample was taken. The final margin samples were free of tumor and carcinoma in situ. Radialis graft elevation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Elevation of the radialis graft on the distal left forearm. Drawing of a radialis graft on the distal forearm with a size of 8 x 6 cm. Extending S-shaped skin incision to the proximal forearm in the crook of the elbow to the proximal forearm in the crook of the elbow. Separation of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the deep forearm fascia. Identification of the confluence of the superficial and deep venous system. Identification of the cephalic vein. Ulnar skin incision in the area of the radialis graft and subfascial dissection up to the anterior edge of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Radial skin preparation on the deep forearm fascia. Identification of the radial nerve (external ramus). Sharp dissection of the subfascial nerve. Particular care is taken to leave sufficient tissue on the tendon of the brachioradialis muscle. Identification of the distal part of the radial artery. Provisional clamping with a vascular clamp. Wait 10 minutes, during which time a good perfusion signal is recorded in the area of the index finger. Separation of the distal radial artery with the comitant veins and ligation. Elevation of the radial artery graft from the depths with constant bipolar coagulation of smaller vessels and placement of several vascular clips. This was successful without any problems. Completion of flap elevation without complications. Deposition of the flap by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Wound closure using split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Incision of the graft: First, the back surface of the soft palate is fixed with three sutures. Folding and folding of the graft and suturing of the front and the tonsil region. The tonsil region is difficult to suture due to swelling of the tongue and small mouth opening. Ultimately, the flap can be sutured in completely and the stalk can be diverted to the right. Start with the anastomosis. The radial artery is connected to the superior thyroid artery. However, a problem then arises in that there is no venous return flow from the dissected veins. It is determined that the confluence between the upper and deeper venous system is insufficient in this radial artery graft. The entire upper venous system is therefore clamped off and the concomitant vein is used for connection. This shows very good reflux in both concomitant veins. Therefore, one is anastomosed end-to-side to the external vein and the second end-to-end to a branch of the facial vein using the coupler. Insertion of a flap and two-layer wound closure. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Flap and wound checks. At the end, a tracheostomy tube was inserted and fixed with a suture. Cannula change on the 5th postoperative day and then suturing again, as the vein situation is very critical and a cannula tape must not be passed over the neck for 10 days under any circumstances.","Transoral tumor resection, Modified radical neck dissection, Free flap (Radial)

After appropriate preparation, skin disinfection and sterile washing. Marking and incision of the apron flap. Dissection cranially up to above the hyoid bone. Then perform the neck dissection on the right side. Skeletonization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the accessorius and hypoglossal nerves. Subsequently, clearing of regions II to IV with preservation of all non-lymphatic structures and dissection of the internal jugular vein and carotid artery. Subsequent exposure of the lateral hyoid horn and release of the infrahyoid muscles with exposure of the thyrohyoid membrane. Skeletonization of the common carotid artery and external carotid artery with exposure of the superior thyroid artery, along which the right thyroid lobe can also be separated from the laryngeal skeleton and displaced laterally. Cut and separate the straight prelaryngeal and prethyroid muscles. Subsequently undermine the thyroid isthmus down to the pretracheal lamina, clamp the isthmus so that the upper six tracheal clasps are fully exposed. Then sharply separate the insertions of the constrictor pharyngis muscle at the edge of the thyroid cartilage and release the piriform sinus on this side. Then transition to the opposite side. In principle, the procedure is the same here with the same findings. Perform the tracheotomy. Opening of the trachea under the 2nd tracheal clasp. Re-intubation of the patient. This is followed by a total laryngectomy. The lingual surface of the epiglottis is exposed up to the upper edge and the mucosa is only incised at the upper edge of the epiglottis. This allows it to be disluxed and the larynx to be removed along the epiglottis and finally postcricoidally. The protrusion of the left-dorsal tumor in the area of the cricoid cartilage can also be seen here, although it remains covered by intact mucosa or muscle tissue. The larynx is then released together with the two upper tracheal clips. Removal of a marginal sample from the caudal resection margin of the specimen towards the trachea as well as from retrolaryngeal tissue in the area of the tumour location. Both histologies prove to be tumor-free in frozen section diagnostics. The pars membranacea of the trachea is then mobilized so that it can be mobilized cranially to complete the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Perform the voice prosthesis puncture with insertion of a size 8 Provox Vega voice prosthesis at the upper edge of the tracheostoma. Perform a myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle. The pharyngeal suture is then applied. The first layer forms a continuous Conley suture. An additional wound closure is made using the single-button technique. Insertion of the Redon suction drains on both sides. Folding back the apron flap. Completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis of the tracheostoma and double-layered suturing of the lateral wound edges. Finally, easy transfer of the patient to a 10-gauge Rügheimer cannula. Sterile wound dressing. Application of a pressure dressing. Final consultation with the anesthetist. Conclusion: Total laryngectomy with selective neck dissection on both sides. Primary voice rehabilitation by implantation of a Provox Vega 8 mm voice prosthesis with myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle.","Total laryngectomy, Selective bilateral neck dissection, Provox

Extension into the nasopharynx, just leaving out the tubal bulges. In addition, an isolated metastasis was found near the retropharyngeal tumor. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment was recommended.","First, after preparation and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, inspection of the primary tumor region by palpation and with the small bore tube. The largely submucosal, tumorous mass can be seen in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, directly adjacent to the retropharyngeal metastasis, which is now clearly progressive compared to CT imaging. Cranially, exophytic, exulcerated tumor part, palpatory just not reaching the tubal bulges. The tumor grows caudally to the border of the oropharynx and hypopharynx and takes up the entire width of the posterior wall of the oropharynx up to the lateral wall. Plastic tracheotomy is now performed for better exposure due to the extensive tumor. To do this, enter at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus and, after exposure, insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal clasps. Performing a visor tracheotomy. Incision in the usual manner and problem-free reintubation, initially on an 8 mm Woodbridge tube, later on an 8 mm low cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. First turn to the transoral procedure. Perform a left paramedian soft palate split. Good exposure of the nasopharyngeal part of the tumor for this. This ends well in front of the choanae and does not reach the tubal bulges on either side. Cut around the entire tumor. Perform a lateral tonsillectomy on both sides. Isolation of the tumor to the prevertebral fascia. Here the tumor is only moderately displaceable and has a large surface area. Due to the exposure, transition to the transcervical approach. For this purpose, a skin incision is made on the left side at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle with a slightly left paramedian tumor. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle while preserving the auricular nerve. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful preservation of the superior thyroid artery and the cervical artery. The facial vein is initially preserved, but is later removed during the transcervical procedure, as is the extremely strong occipital artery. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Free dissection of the internal jugular vein and clearing of level V while carefully preserving the cervical plexus branches. Subsequent resection of the digastric muscle, already directly connected to the enoral side. Widening of the pharyngotomy. Now exposure in depth. The tumor can be resected by removing the pharyngeal musculature. The prevertebral fascia only needs to be detached in a circumscribed manner. In this case, the resection distance is narrow, but macroscopically and palpatorily completely in sano, and there is also no evidence of perforation of the prevertebral fascia. Removal of the tumor now via transcervical. During mobilization, the nasopharnygeal portion is ruptured. For this reason, the tumor is sent in 2 parts ........ and a complete in-sano resection is also macroscopically present in the marginal area. The tumor is now completely imaged with marginal samples. All tumor........., tumor- and dysplasia-free, so that an R0 situation can be assumed. For the exposure of the tumor, the external and internal carotid arteries had to be visualized in a long-distance view. Extensive pharyngotomy. Therefore absolute indication for defect coverage using a free graft. Neck dissection of the right side should be performed first. In principle, the same procedure is used here. Expose the limiting musculature. Removal of the anterior neck preparation and preservation of the cervical artery, the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the nerves. No evidence of lymphatic leakage and dry wound conditions. Finally, exploration and cranial dissection of the external and internal carotid artery, in case of metastatic contact with the internal carotid artery on CT. This is completely explored. No further metastasis or tumor parts, so that the metastasis is also resected in toto. The defect is now measured. Decision to lift an anterolateral thigh graft from the right thigh. For this purpose, after doppler sonographic identification of 3 skin perforators, marking of a graft measuring 11 x 6 cm in total. Medial incision. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Cutting through the fascia lata. Exposing and securing the rectus femoris muscle. Strictly subfascial dissection. Exposure of the pedicle vessel. Performing the extension incision. Complete resection of the graft. A musculocutaneous perforator course is visible, therefore a narrow muscle cuff is included. Isolation on the vascular pedicle and placement of the vital graft in the area of the pedicle vessels. Careful hemostasis and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, multi-layer wound closure. Subsequently, combined transoral and transcervical insertion of the graft. Here, the suturing conditions were considerably more difficult and laborious. Finally, however, intact and tight conditions on all sides both cervically on both sides and nasopharyngeally. Suturing of the temporary soft palate cleft. Subsequent left-sided cervical pedicle positioning. First conditioning of the occipital artery. This shows extensive vascular damage to the intima. Further conditioning of the facial artery. Damage here too, but better conditions. Several suture attempts with 8-0 Ethilon are initially frustrating here, however, with rapid cessation of venous return flow. Subsequent conditioning of the submental artery. After suturing the artery, a sufficient circulation with proper flap vitality is now achieved, so that in vital conditions, after positioning the pedicle on both sides, the wound is irrigated and, in dry wound conditions, a 10 Redon drain is inserted and the wound is carefully closed. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected, extensive cT3 cN1 to 2a oropharyngeal carcinoma of the posterior pharyngeal wall with extension into the nasopharynx and hypopharynx. Extensive retropharyngeal metastasis adjacent to the tumor. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Sobelin 600 mg, which should be continued for 24 hours postoperatively. If the graft heals properly, a gradual increase in diet is possible from the 8th postoperative day. However, due to the extensive resection, a protracted recovery of the swallowing function is to be expected.","Pharyngectomy, Neck dissection, Pedicled flap (ALT)

Unremarkable conditions in the trachea to carina area. Followed by transoral, endotracheal intubation. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon. A flexible esophagoscopy is performed using an endoscope, which is carefully advanced to the stomach under visualization. Inconspicuous conditions in the area of the entire oesophagus and stomach. Endoscopic inversion and inspection of the oesophago-gastric junction, with unremarkable findings. Retraction of the endoscope and performance of a rigid laryngo- and pharyngoscopy using a Kleinsasser C-tube. The endolarynx was completely unremarkable, the right piriform sinus, posterior wall of the hypopharynx and the postcricoidal region were unremarkable. In the area of the left piriform sinus and on its lateral wall, a tiny, spherical, exophytic mass covered by smooth mucosa was found, which was sent for an excisional biopsy for intraoperative frozen section examination. Subsequent inspection of the rest of the pharynx. The oropharyngeal region is completely normal. Samples are then taken from the right and left middle of the base of the tongue and hemostasis is performed using monopolar coagulation. Placement of the oral retractors and subsequent tonsillectomy, initially on the right side. Parauvular incision. Exposure of the upper pole. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Exposure of the correct layer, capsular approach from cranial to caudal while sparing the anterior and posterior palatal arch. Deposition of the tonsil preparation in its lower pole, hemostasis there using bipolar coagulation. Subsequently, identical procedure on the left side. Parauvular incision, exposure of the upper pole, hemostasis there using bipolar coagulation. Exposure of the right capsular layer, dissection along the tonsil capsule from cranial to caudal. Hemostasis in the caudal pole using bipolar coagulation and placement of the tonsil preparation in the lower pole. Dry conditions. The right tonsil and the sample from the left hypopharynx are sent for intraoperative frozen section. The remaining samples were sent for final histology. The intraoperative frozen section examination resulted in a positive finding (G3 squamous cell carcinoma) in the area of the left hypopharynx. The findings were adjusted using a Kleinsasser C-tube and the laser beam was set to a power of 4 watts in continuous mode. Moving around the findings using the CO2 laser. Removal of the sampling region in toto. Subsequently, 3 marginal samples (anterior wall of the piriform sinus, median wall of the piriform sinus, lateral wall of the piriform sinus) which are sent for final examination. Hemostasis there using monopolar coagulation. Removal of the Kleinsasser tube and subsequent repositioning of the patient for the planned neck dissection on the left side. Application of local anesthesia there after skin spray disinfection. Ablate the skin, sterile draping. Make an incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the accessorius nerve, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure cranial to the posterior venter of the digastric muscle. A large metastasis is already visible in this area. Dissection of the metastasis from the accessorius nerve, the internal jugular vein and the facial vein as well as from the posterior venter of the digaster muscle. Removal of the same in toto. Subsequent dissection along the cervical vascular sheath from caudal to cranial. Protection of the cervical vascular sheath structures. Successive removal of the posterior neck specimen while sparing the plexus branches. This revealed several metastases. Removal of the anterior neck specimen, where further metastases were found. Dry conditions. Treatment of region V with multiple ligatures to avoid a chyle fistula. Dry conditions. Wound irrigation with hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Repeated inspection. Placement of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Completion of the procedure without complications. Conclusion: CUP panendoscopy, laser resection of a cT1 G3 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the left side confirmed by intraoperative frozen section, modified radical neck resection while sparing the internal jugular vein and the accessory nerve and sternocleidomastoid muscle.

Sonography showed a cN 2c neck status directly preoperatively, the CT scan performed showed no evidence of distant metastasis.","First start with the PEG insertion. Entering with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. If diaphanoscopy is good and the stomach has been punctured without any problems, the PEG tube is inserted using the usual thread pull-through method. After repositioning the patient, turn to pharyngoscopy and inspect the primary tumor. There is an exophytic process in the area of the right tonsil, which partially reaches the soft palate via the anterior palatal arch and the posterior palatal arch. Right-sided subtotal infiltration and consumption of the uvula. Infiltration of the base of the uvula on the left side, macroscopically on the right side, right caudally, not exceeding the tonsil lobe, also palpatorily no indication of deep infiltration in the cervical direction. The tumor is now resected with partial soft palate resection with a safety margin of approx. 1.5 cm. Release of the tumorously altered tonsil with lateral preservation of a soft tissue mantle. Complete removal of the posterior palatal arch, also here removal of muscles on all sides. Deposition at the lower tonsil pole. Inspection reveals a macroscopically and palpatorily clearly resected tumor in sano. The specimen is thread-marked on all sides for frozen section diagnostics and is diagnosed here as a squamous cell carcinoma resected in sano. Inspection of the defect. There is a clear soft palate in the defect. Approximately 2 cm of the soft palate have been subtotally resected. Subtotal resection of the posterior palatal arch so that the defect in the area of the tonsillar lobe is resected. Measurement of a 0.5 x 4.5 cm graft with separate logging for the soft palate. The neck is first dissected on the left side. To do this, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein, which is very slender here. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of a strong transcervical vein. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery as well as the cervical artery and the hypoglossal nerve. A very strong anterior jugular vein can be seen here. A true facial vein is not present here. Some of the sides of the anterior jugular vein are ligated, but overall it is preserved as a vessel. The vein takes up the submandibular region via the lateral branches. The branches are also preserved here. Complete exposure of the digastric muscle. Exposure and free preparation of the internal jugular vein while carefully preserving the vessel. Exposure of the accessory nerve. Level 2 shows a hardened palpable lymph node measuring approx. 2.5 x 1.5 cm on the internal jugular vein. Macroscopically quite suspicious, but without perinodal and nodal growth. Finally, evacuation of the accessorius triangle with careful protection and evacuation of level 5 with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches as well as caudal dry conditions without lymph vessel alteration. Final wound inspection with dry conditions on palpation. No further masses, no bleeding. Wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drainage, careful two-layer wound closure. The neck dissection of the right side is now carried out in parallel and the radialis graft is lifted for neck dissection. Basically the same procedure as on the opposite side. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue along the anterior edge of the muscle. Expose and cut through the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and auricular nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Visualization of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation, carefully preserving the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. The size and shape of the lymph nodes are conspicuous in level 2 and in the transition to level 3, so that the cN2c neck status can be confirmed intraoperatively. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Evacuation of level 5 with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. There is also no true facial vein on the right side. Strong upper thyroid branch. This is prepared for later anastomization, and the superior thyroid artery is also dissected, although it is relatively slender, so the faciliac artery is also prepared. The carotid artery is now dissected cranially after removal of the digastric muscle. Dissection up to the styloid, then the pharyngotomy can be performed in the area of the tonsillar lobe by transoral control. Widen the pharyngotomy, taking the surrounding muscles with it. This results in a tunnel a good two transverse fingers wide. Now to lift the radialis graft. After marking the graft, identify the radial artery by palpation and the cephalic vein. Perform the tourniquet. Cut around the graft. Radial start. Exposure of the cephalic vein. Exposure of the brachialis muscle. Exposure of the Haydn maneuver. Exposure and securing of the superficial ramus, radial nerve. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle. Blunt cutting of the vascular pedicle distally after ligation, strictly subfascial release. After complete exposure of the brachioradialis muscle with isolation and removal of the cephalic vein. Inappropriate dissection, exposure and dissection of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. Exclusion of a superficial ulnar artery. Complete release of the graft with careful clipping of outgoing vessels. Isolation on the vascular pedicle with the radial artery and accompanying veins as well as additional elevation of the strong cephalic vein. Expose a strong bridge of the accompanying veins to the cephalic vein and, if the accompanying vein is relatively confluent, take the bridge branch and isolate it on the cephalic vein after clipping the remaining branches of the outgoing veins. Exposure of the branch of the radial artery. Exposure of the outlet of the anterior interosseous artery and the powerful ulnar artery. Both vessels are left intact and spared. Re-opening of the tourniquet with uterine hemostasis with a vital, regular graft and regular blood supply to the hand. Finally, after careful hemostasis in the case of a vital graft, the graft is removed. Subsequent careful two-layer wound closure. Removal of the full-thickness skin graft from the groin and final application of a vacuum sealing bandage and the cramp splint in the functional position and repositioning of the arm. For full-thickness skin harvesting from the groin on the right, mark a full-thickness skin graft measuring a good 10 x 5 cm. Cut around the skin with strict cutaneous elevation. Careful subcutaneous mobilization. Meticulous hemostasis and careful multi-layer wound closure under moderate tension after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. The radialis graft is now inserted transcervically. Gradual insertion of the graft under soft palate reconstruction and doubling of the graft. Careful insertion of the tonsil lobe. Finally, dense conditions and good adaptation conditions. Microscopic conditioning of the pedicle vessels, very strong radial artery and strong cespal vein. First conditioning of the superior thyroid artery. A very slender vessel can now be seen here, even after removal, so that the superior thyroid artery is clipped. Dissection of the facial artery. ......... of the vessel. Moderate difference in caliber with further caliber advantage of the radial artery. Conditioning of the vessels and successive caliber-adapted anastomization with 8.0 Ethilon, this is laborious, but finally succeeds well and adequately with immediate regular venous return and regular flap perfusion. Now conditioning of the superior thyroid vein in order to achieve some degree of caliber equivalence, this must be placed relatively close to the internal jugular vein. Measure a coupler of size 3.0 and perform the venous anastomosis with the coupler. Immediate regular venous return after reopening of the artery, regular perfusion with regular pedicle pulsation and good graft perfusion. Multiple inspections. Enoral conditions remain lean, therefore a defect limited to the tonsillar lobe and the soft palate is avoided, a tracheostomy is not performed and the procedure is terminated after the patient has been repositioned. The patient received intraoperative i.V. antibiotic treatment with Unacid 3 g. This should be continued for 24 hours and a single-shot administration of 250 mg SDH to prevent swelling. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT2 cN2c oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. From the 8th postoperative day onwards, with a properly healing graft and dense conditions, a gradual increase in diet is possible. Postoperatively, please monitor the flap meticulously by enoral inspection. Note: On the right cervical side, the course of the pedicle is relatively close to the subcutaneous level of the carotid bulb. Please strictly avoid pressure bandages here and exercise caution when opening if necessary.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), PEG placement

A moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma without HPV association was found. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment was indicated. CT showed no evidence of distant metastasis, no evidence of osseous infiltration.","After preparation and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, a pharyngo-laryngoscopy was performed to determine the current extent of the tumor. A coarse exulcerated tumor of the right tonsillar lobe was found, here coarsely seated and not displaceable. Infiltration of the soft palate also submucosal to parauvular on the right. Growth up to the dorsal maxilla. Growth circumscribed to the alveolar ridge. Growth to buccal over the glossotonsillar groove and the posterior floor of the mouth. Infiltration of the edge of the tongue and also the base of the tongue, here about Ľ infiltrated. Posterior palatal arch is reached. Also the caudal, former tonsil pole. No further tumor growth further caudally. Ultrasonography shows a cN2b neck status with infiltration of the internal jugular vein. The tumor is now resected transorally. Incision of the tumor with a safety margin of a good 1 cm and subtotal removal of the soft palate. Resection up to the left tonsil lobe. Subtotal removal of the soft palate. Resection up to the cheek. Exposure of the maxillary bone. Removal of the last gingival pocket and thus pushing the tumor away from the maxilla, which is growing close here, but certainly not breaking through the periosteum. The same procedure is now performed on the mandibular branch via the buccal side. View of the ascending mandibular branch. The tumor grows here, but does not reach the periosteum. From the inside, pushing off the periosteum in the posterior region. Close growth to the periosteum. Here the entire periosteum is pushed away from the posterior mandible, resulting in a good solution. A clear infiltration of the pharyngeal musculature can now be seen in depth. This is resected subtotally. Growth up to the pterygoid musculature. Circumscribed infiltration here. Overall, however, good mobilization of the tumour, so that the tumour can be mobilized cranially after detachment of the musculature with a clear safety margin. Resection of the posterior floor of the mouth and the edge of the tongue, maintaining a safety margin of 1 ˝ cm in the area of the tongue. Removal of the tumor in the area of the tongue down to the base of the tongue. It can now be seen that the tumor has broken through to the cervical region via the posterior floor of the mouth and laterally via the base of the tongue. Partial infiltration of the submandibular gland, which is already visualized enorally. Exposure of the lingual nerve, which is broad anteriorly but clearly infiltrated by the tumor dorsally. This is later removed. Due to the growth, the decision was made to proceed with a combined procedure and further transcervical resection. Therefore, repositioning for neck dissection of the right side. Curved skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle with careful preservation of the extremely strong external jugular vein. A clear infiltration of the muscle by the metastasis located in level II can already be seen in the upper area of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Clear infiltration. Now caudal visualization of the entire sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Separation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and cranial dissection. A markedly coarsely growing mass is seen in levels II and III, with a structure that most closely resembles a soft tissue metastasis. The internal jugular vein is now visualized. Cranial dissection. The vein is also clearly infiltrated in the middle area. The vein is therefore removed after securing the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Cranial dissection. The accessor nerve can be found below the trapezius muscle, but is clearly infiltrated medially and is also resected later. The metastasis grows close to the carotid bulb. The superior thyroid artery can be secured. The lingual artery must be removed later if the tumor grows, as must the facial artery. Careful dissection in the area of the bulb. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Careful dissection of the nerve, the carotid bulb and the hypoglossal nerve can be preserved at the end. Securing the internal carotid artery. Certainly no tumor growth here, the rest of the external carotid artery is again free. A small tumor cone can now be dissected on the carotid artery in the direction of the primary tumor. Careful release of the cone. Removal of all surrounding tissue. Cranial removal of the internal jugular vein. The tumor cone can be followed towards the posterior floor of the mouth. Release of the submandibular gland, which is not infiltrated in the caudal part. Perform the pharyngotomy via the extirpation of the submandibular gland. Extend the pharyngotomy and complete the tumor resection, including the infiltrated floor of the mouth, and include the base of the tongue, resecting a good 1/3 of the base of the tongue. Overall, there is a clear breakthrough into the muscles of the floor of the mouth via the base of the tongue and the posterior floor of the mouth, resulting in a cT4a finding. The entire tumor specimen is thread-marked in toto with adjacent soft tissue metastasis for definitive histology. Enorally, all mucosal margins are provided with margin samples. This shows an R0 resection for the invasive carcinoma on all sides. Only the area of the floor of the mouth shows circumscribed CIS. Therefore, a generous resection and a new margin sample were performed here. Here, too, CIS was suspected, so that after a further resection a final specimen was taken, which was then assessed in the frozen section as completely free of tumor and dysplasia, so that overall an R0 resection with extensive growing cT4a oropharyngeal carcinoma with breakthrough and metastasis per continuitatem in the soft tissues of the neck can be assumed. The neck dissection is now completed. This involves clearing out level V while carefully sparing the cervical plexus branches. Also clear and complete level I b. Here too, several nodes measuring up to just under 2 cm. If the wound is dry, neck dissection of the left side and elevation of the radialis graft from the right forearm are now performed in parallel. Neck dissection of the left side. To do this, make a curved skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Dissection of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. This shows a macroscopically suspicious mass in the jugulofacial angle, but without infiltration of the surrounding tissue. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Excision of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and excision of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Final wound inspection. In dry conditions, wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and in dry wound conditions, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Now to elevate the radialis graft. After marking the graft measuring up to 13 x 10 cm in total with a special configuration for the base of the tongue, floor of the mouth and soft palate. Creation of the tourniquet. Trimming of the graft. First radial preparation. This shows that the cephalic vein lies very far dorsally in the area of origin and is not in contact with the graft over a long distance, so that the cephalic vein does not need to be included. Exposure of the superficial radial nerve ramus, which can be completely spared. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle. Dissection of the vascular pedicle. Ulnar dissection. Strictly subfascial release of the graft, leaving the peritendineum intact. Subsequent cranial dissection of the pedicle utilizing the entire pedicle position and left-sided anastomosis. A strong venous confluence can be seen here. Reopening of the tourniquet. A properly perfused graft is visible. Careful hemostasis and later removal of the graft after ligation of the vessel leading to ................ Subsequently, with dry wound conditions, careful, two-layer wound closure and harvesting of the full-thickness skin graft taken from the right groin. The vacuum pump is then applied and the Kramer splint is placed in the functional position. Removal of the full-thickness skin graft. To do this, cut around an area measuring 16 x 7.5 cm in total. Wider lifting is not possible due to increased skin tension. Incision of the graft. Strictly cutaneous lifting. Subcutaneous mobilization down to the fascia lata and the abdominal fascia. Subsequent insertion of a 10 Redon drain in dry wound conditions and multi-layer, subcutaneous wound closure and skin suturing. To incorporate the graft. For this purpose, combined transoral and transcervical suturing is performed using partially placed sutures. Difficult suturing conditions in the upper and lower jaw area. However, overall good fit, especially in the area of the caudal pharynx and the base of the tongue. Resection extending into the vallecula. Overall adequate fit here. In the meantime, the tracheotomy was performed. Horizontal skin incision at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and incision of the tracheostoma in the typical manner. Subsequently, transfer to a size 8 low-cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. The cervical vessels are now prepared. The lingual artery is no longer sufficiently pervious or has an inadequate flow after the tube is removed, so the superior thyroid artery is now prepared. Excellent flow here. Preparation of the graft vessels. Then perform the arterial anastomosis with 8-0 Ethilon. This works relatively well even with unequal vessel calibers. Good adaptation. After reopening the blood flow, regular venous return flow and good pedicle pulsation immediately. Now prepare the external jugular vein. This is seen cranially with a questionably discrete thrombus. Open the vein. After removing a small amount of thrombotic material, excellent reflux, so that after measuring a size 3.0 coupler, anastomosis is performed with the coupler system. Subsequent regular circulation. Positive spreading phenomenon and regular pedicle pulsation as well as regular graft perfusion, so that after final wound inspection and wound irrigation with Ringer's solution, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and subsequent careful, two-layer wound closure. Final inspection of the graft and, if the graft is vital, termination of the procedure at this point. Conclusion: Intraoperatively R0-resected, extremely aggressive growing cT4a cN2c oropharyngeal carcinoma with perifocal CIS and metastasis per continuitatem in the soft tissues of the neck. Due to the resected surrounding musculature, a prolonged recovery of swallowing function can be expected. If the graft heals properly, the first clinical swallowing diagnostics can be carried out from the 9th postoperative day, followed by a diet if necessary. Due to tumor growth, adjuvant radiochemotherapy is urgently indicated.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect reconstruction, Free flap (Radial)

The above-mentioned surgery was therefore indicated.,"First, pharyngoscopy again. The exophytic tumor is seen, which is located in the pharyngeal side wall and in the piriform sinus on the front right and is fixed to the hemilarynx on the right. Confirmed in conjunction with CT above mentioned surgery. Patient was also informed about the use of a radial flap to cover the defect if necessary. First injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both parts of the neck. Then sterile draping. Create the apron flap subplatysmally in the typical manner. Veins are bipolized and ligated. Dissection of the apron flap up to the level of the hyoid bone or the submandibular gland. Then neck dissection modified radical right: exposure of the digastric muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. V. jugularis interna, A. carotis interna and externa. Exposure of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. The latter must be pushed away from the tumor block, which is successful. Subsequent evacuation level II-V while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Neck preparation can be dissected away from the tumor, no per continuitatem growth. The upper pole of the thyroid gland was removed with the tumor specimen, the lower edge parts can be preserved, the thyroid gland was treated with puncture ligation. The superior thyroid artery was cut and ligated. Then modified radical neck dissection on the left: Basic procedure in the same way as on the left side. Exposure of the digastric muscle and omohyoid muscle here too. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein. Depiction of the common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery. Depiction of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve. All structures can be well preserved. A. thyroidea superior is dissected long towards the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is deposited at the isthmus in such a way that a cystic nodule in the isthmus area is deposited together with the tumor specimen, with puncture ligatures on both adjacent sides. Exposure of the trachea. Evacuation of levels II-IV and parts of V. Retention of the branches of the cervical plexus. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Now tumor resection: separation of the infrahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone. Exposure of the upper horn of the thyroid cartilage on the left and dissection of the pharyngeal tube. Release of the piriform sinus. This is not possible on the right due to tumor growth. Thyroid gland is displaced caudo-laterally on both sides with exposure of the trachea from the side. Entry into the larynx on the left paramedian side after exposure of the epiglottis. The exophytic tumor is visible. This is resected on all sides with a safety margin of approx. 1.5-2 cm. Inclusion of the entire pharyngeal musculature. The upper pole of the thyroid gland is integrated into the tumor preparation. Left mucosa-sparing procedure as far as possible. Release of the larynx. Separation of the larynx from the trachea under incision, which extends the trachea cranially. Send in the entire specimen marked with sutures. Also send in 2 marginal samples in the cranial area mucosal marginal sample and cranio-basal. The entire specimen was removed in the healthy area. The cranial mucosal margin sample and the cranio-basal soft tissue margin sample are also healthy, thus R0 status. Overall, there is a defect extending not far from the esophageal entrance; cranially, the defect is connected to parts of the pharyngeal wall. Inspection revealed the possibility of closing the pharynx without a flap, hence the decision to proceed with this procedure. Myotomy first. A tear in the mucosa is seen slightly above the myotomy, which must be sutured. Inconspicuous conditions in the area of the myotomy. This improves the passage. Due to the overall tight mucosal conditions and the mucosal tear near the myotomy, a Provox prosthesis insertion is not performed intraoperatively in this case. The pharyngeal suture is performed. The first layer is performed between the remaining remnants of the pharyngeal wall and the adjacent tongue base tissue. This is done in two layers. The remaining pharyngeal mucosa can now be adapted to create a T-shaped suture. Inverting suture as the first suture. Then 2nd suture on top so that all layers are sutured in two layers. Sutures each with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Third suture cannot be performed as there are no pharyngeal muscle remnants on the right. Hyoid bone was removed cranially to reduce tension. Infrahyoid musculature is sutured to the remains of the suprahyoid musculature using several adaptation sutures. Careful irrigation of the wound area again with H202 and Ringer's solution and careful hemostasis. At the end, the site is free of bleeding. Wound closure in layers and insertion of a Redon drain into both sides of the neck and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Finally, insertion of a 10 mm tracheostomy tube. The procedure was completed without complications. Patient transferred to intensive care unit for monitoring. Please continue intraoperative antibiotics with Unacid for 2-3 days. Keep the patient fasting for 10 days, then swallow gruel and, if necessary, build up diet. Nutrition in the meantime via the inserted PEG tube. Please leave the feeding tube in place. If the healing process is normal, a Provox prosthesis can then be inserted secondarily. Overall cT4a cN2c hypopharyngeal carcinoma with invasion of the larynx. After laryngectomy and partial pharyngectomy, direct closure in borderline but low-tension conditions. Postoperative presentation of the patient to the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Laryngectomy, Partial pharyngectomy, Neck dissection

The patient still needed time to think about the planned laryngectomy and partial pharyngectomy and a second opinion. Therefore, the above-mentioned procedure was performed, as the patient was ultimately able to decide on the operation, but wanted the operation in <LOCATION>.","First, induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Intubation was very difficult and only possible orally with great difficulty, then sterile washing and draping, prior inspection with the small water tube and visualization of the tumor, the tumor is located on the medial wall of the piriform sinus and extends to the aryepiglottic fold and the arytenoid cartilage on the left side. The tumor is exophytic and affects the entire left medial and anterior wall of the piriform sinus; the tip of the piriform sinus and the esophageal entrance are tumor-free. A PEG is now inserted using the suture pull-through method with good diaphanoscopy. Then sterile washing and draping and creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Then release of the larynx and detachment of the neck vessel sheath on both sides. Release of the piriform sinus on the right side, this is successful without any problems. Then only very slight and partial release of the piriform sinus on the left side, then release of the hyoid bone and performance of the tracheotomy in the usual manner directly below the cricoid cartilage. Then perform the pharyngoscopy. To do this, enter with the Hartmann spatula directly above the epiglottis. Then disluxation of the epiglottis and detachment of the mucosa of the lingual surface of the epiglottis and detachment of the larynx, initially on the right side. Then inspection of the tumor and removal of the tumor in the pharyngeal part in the piriform sinus on the left with a safety margin of 1.5 cm and removal of the larynx below the cricoid cartilage. Removal of marginal samples from the mucosa. All marginal samples are tumor-free, free of carcinoma in situ and without high-grade dysplasia. Now inspection of the mucosa, intraoperative demonstration on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. A joint decision is made to dispense with a transplant as there is still sufficient local mucosa. Now complete the neck dissection on both sides, on the right side through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. For this, expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Then free preparation of the internal jugular vein and the facial vein, then removal of the neck preparation IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Several small roundish metastases were found in level II, the levels were sent in individually as part of the lymph node study and the neck dissection was carried out on the left side at the same time. This revealed a very large lymph node conglomerate that completely infiltrated the internal jugular vein, which was therefore removed. The vagus nerve was also found to be infiltrated. In consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, this is also resected; the metastasis can then be detached from the common carotid artery and the external and internal carotid arteries. The accessorius nerve can be preserved, but the more distal plexus branches are interspersed with metastases and infiltrated, so most of these must be resected, resulting in a radical neck dissection on the left side and a modified radical neck dissection on the right side. A Provox-Vega prosthesis is then placed in the usual manner, followed by a three-layer pharyngeal suture in the usual manner. Incision of the tracheostoma in the usual manner and two-layer wound closure after insertion of 2 Redon drains.","Laryngectomy, Partial pharyngectomy, and Neck dissection

Therefore, carrying out the team time out. Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Then insertion of the PEG gastric tube. Careful insertion of the flexible endoscope under air insufflation. Then positive diaphanoscopy loco typico. Subsequent skin disinfection of the abdomen and upper abdomen, infiltration anesthesia and placement of the PEG gastric tube using the thread pull-through technique without any problems by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Preoperative administration of 3 g Unacid. The tumor is then resected by <CLINICIAN_NAME> . Adjustment of the base of the tongue by <CLINICIAN_NAME> with the spreading laryngoscope and the support. Use the microscope. The tumor of at least 1 cm in size described in the panendoscopy is seen in the cranial base of the tongue, not approaching the midline, but there is still questionable unstable mucosa at the caudal medial edge. Now set the laser to cw 8 watts. Mark the resection margins with the laser. Successive resection of the tumor using the laser with the aid of Blakesley. Attention is paid to the lateral vascular bundle. Laser resection is performed up to the borders of the oropharynx laterally and into the vallecula. The mass is then sent to the frozen section in toto with the markings cranial tongue base and lateral oropharyngeal side wall, caudal vallecula and medial. Repeated meticulous hemostasis, then dry wound conditions. The frozen section then shows a CIS forming a margin from 3 o'clock to 12 o'clock. Therefore, the resection is now performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. To do this, adjust the base of the tongue with the spreading laryngoscope and, with the aid of the support, adjust using a microscope and laser. The laser is set to 8 watts. Now successive resection. Final marginal samples are taken from 3 o'clock/ oropharyngeal side wall to 6 o'clock. A second margin sample from 6 o'clock to 9 o'clock, suture marking at 6 o'clock and third margin sample from 9 o'clock to 12 o'clock. The post-resection shows that the mucosa is completely normal; it is not possible to differentiate between CIS and normal mucosa. Then repeated hemostasis using monopolar coagulation, followed by re-inspection of the surgical site with the Kleinsasser tube. Occasionally targeted bipolar coagulation. There is now a large wound surface over the entire base of the tongue from the right to the opposite side and filling the entire vallecula. Here, however, the wound is dry. Subsequent transition to neck dissection on the right side. Infiltration anesthesia with a total of 20 ml Ultracaine in the area of the neck dissection incision on the right side and on the left side. Skin disinfection of the surgical area and sterile draping of the surgical area. Then mark the landmarks on both sides of the mastoid, jugulum, mandibular angle and mandibular margin and sternocleidomastoid anterior margin. Then mark the skin incisions on the right and left of the mastoid in an arched medial direction and towards the sternocleidomastoid in a caudal direction. Ensure that the incision is as symmetrical as possible on both sides. Now start on the right side. Cut through the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue, cut through the platysma. Now develop the medial neck preparation and dissect subplatysmal using a scalpel. Expose the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid and dissect it caudally. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and sparing of the same. Exposure of the entire course of the jugular vein and protection of the same. This is conspicuously thin, with a jump in caliber only in the caudal part of level IV. Exposure of the cervical vein, which is also exposed and spared. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the digaster venter anteriorly and posteriorly and protection of the same. Exposure of the mandibular salivary gland. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and sparing of the same. Now resection of the medial neck preparation. Here 2 suspicious level II lymph nodes are noticed. These are resected in toto. Expose the internal and external bifurcation and the superior thyroid artery and spare them. Note: The auricularis magnus nerve was exposed and spared during the skin incision. A larger caliber branch of the external jugular vein was ligated. Now resection of the lateral triangle of the neck. Here, the vagus nerve is first exposed and spared, the accessorius triangle is resected cranial to the accessorius nerve, mobilization under the accessorius nerve. Dissection down to the plexus branches and resection of the lateral neck preparation from cranial to caudal up to level IV as well as level Va and b. The plexus branches are also spared. Removal of the lateral neck preparation. The facial vein could not be visualized. Now targeted bipolar coagulation, irrigation with H202 and Ringer. Increase in pressure to 160, targeted bipolar coagulation, otherwise very dry wound conditions. Application of a 10 redon and two-layer wound closure using subcutaneous and cutaneous sutures. Application of a pressure dressing. Turning to the opposite side. Identical procedure here. First cut through the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma with a scalpel. Expose the auricularis magnus nerve. Sparing of the same. Dissection of the branches of the external jugular vein and ligation of the same. The neck preparation is dissected subplatysmally. Expose the anterior sternocleidomastoid margin and dissect caudally. Exposure of the jugular vein and sparing of the same. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and sparing of the same. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Cranial dissection. Exposure of the digaster venter anteriorly and posteriorly as well as the mandibular salivary gland. Now resection of the medial neck preparation, exposing the cervical anus and the hypoglossal nerve, which is spared. Removal of the medial neck specimen. Resection of the lateral neck specimen. The carotid artery and the vagus are still exposed and spared. Level IIa, Va and III are also resected up to level IV. The plexus branches are exposed and spared. Then targeted bipolar coagulation, irrigation with H202 and Ringer. Increase the peep and pressure, then no further bleeding. Dry wound conditions. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon and two-layer wound closure using subcutaneous and cutaneous sutures. Application of a pressure dressing. Now create a protective tracheostomy. To do this, mark the thyroid incisura, cricoid cartilage, jugulum and the planned skin incision 1 QF below the cricoid cartilage. Now make the skin incision of approx. 3 cm horizontally and cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose a larger caliber vein, which is ligated. Dissection of the infrahyal musculature. Incision in the median line. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the isthmus, this is relatively far cranial. Undermining of the isthmus using a clamp. Overall, the isthmus is very narrow, therefore coagulation in the median line and transection of the isthmus. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea and the tracheal clips. The brachiocephalic trunk can be palpated in depth. Now identify the area between the 2nd and 3rd cricoid cartilage. Enter with the scissors. Suture with 2 caudal and 2 cranial sutures. Skin suture with 2 stitches on the right and left. Then problem-free reintubation to an 8-gauge cannula and completion of the procedure without complications. Preoperative administration of 3 g Unacid. The patient goes to the intensive care unit intubated and ventilated.

Mark the resection margins with the electric needle and then generously resect the left tonsil, leaving the posterior palatal arch intact. Part of the base of the tongue is resected caudally. Intermediate bipolar hemostasis. The specimen is then marked with sutures and sent for histological frozen section examination. In the course of the operation, the specimen is found to be tumor-free on all sides. Insertion of a hydrogen swab, bipolar hemostasis and repositioning for neck dissection on the right: Here, first instillation of 10 ml xylocaine with added adrenaline in the area of the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Then make a curved incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Now expose the omohyoid muscle, the accessorius nerve and the digaster muscle. Then expose the entire length of the internal jugular vein. Dissect the neck preparation caudally after exposing the carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Then detach the cranial neck preparation from the upper accessory triangle while protecting the nerve. Now successively detach the posterior neck preparation while protecting all plexus branches.

Palpation reveals a large, coarse lump in the depth of the neck. Curved skin incision in the area of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the anterior edge. This goes approximately to the middle of the dissection seen from the caudal side, as the tumor is already infiltrating the musculature here. Now expose the lower border in the sense of the omohyoid muscle. Visualization of the jugular vein. It can be seen that it runs through the tumor block, with an extremely congested facial vein. Now laboriously locate the digaster muscle and successively release the tumor block in the upper accessorius triangle. The accessorius nerve can be exposed with great effort, as it runs through the tumor. However, it can be separated from the tumor while preserving a small displacement layer. Demonstration of the findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and decision to leave the nerve in place. Now, with resection of parts of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, detachment of the tumor specimen laterally. Subsequent medial dissection. The tumor extends to the carotid artery with a clear displacement layer. As the jugular vein runs through the tumor, clamp it caudally and cranially, place 2 lower ligatures as well as 2 re-stitches and remove the vein. The tumor block can now be easily worked out after detachment from the vagus nerve. In between, a swab of tumor secretions is taken and sent for microbiological examination. Further excision of the tumor block with partial removal of plexus branches. The hypoglossal nerve has already been exposed due to dissection. The decision was made to ligate the external carotid artery. Identification of the same, visualization of the thyroid artery and the ascending lingual pharyngeal artery. The external carotid artery is then ligated. Then dissect up to the capsule of the submandibular gland and remove it. Follicularization of the anterior neck and irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Minute bipolar hemostasis and insertion of a Redon drain. Then two-layer wound closure.

First positioning of the patient for transoral tumor resection. Insertion of the mouth retractor. Subsequent marking of the margins. The tumor extends from the middle of the tongue body at the edge of the tongue to the base of the tongue and passes over to the glossotonsillar groove. Here it still partially infiltrates the anterior gauemnian arch. Medially, the tumor extends to approximately the middle of the tongue. Therefore, the first step is to approach the tumor and resect it with the Harmonic ultrasonic knife. The resection is performed under constant visual control and at a sufficient distance from the tumor. Larger vessels are ligated during resection. Follow the tumor dorsally. Detachment of the tumor at the palatal arch. Here resection of the glossotonsillar groove on the right side. Further tracing of the tumor at the medial edge of the deposit in a dorsal direction. This shows a cone that extends beyond the midline. This cone is also cut around and the tumor is removed in toto together with the base of the tongue on the right side. At a point where the tumor has formed the cone medially, the specimen is marked with a suture and sent for frozen section diagnostics. The tumor is barely resected in sano, which is why an additional safety margin is resected from the medial tongue body. Two representative frozen section samples are taken in the area of the margin of the floor of the mouth and palatal arch to ensure R0 resection. These are also sent for intraoperative frozen section diagnostics and are found to be tumor-free. Subtle hemostasis. Repositioning of the patient for PEG insertion. First, insertion of the flexible instrument into the esophagus and visualization up to the stomach. After filling the stomach with air, a positive diaphanoscopy is obtained. Then place the gastric tube in the typical location under visual control, with positive diaphanoscopy and positive tent phenomenon using the thread pull-through method. After aspiration of the insufflated air, mirror back and carefully inspect the esophageal mucosa, which is also non-irritant and inconspicuous. Removal of the instruments. The patient is repositioned for tracheotomy. This is necessary due to the extent of the tumor. Tracheotomy: First injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline on both sides of the neck in preparation for neck dissection and pretracheally. Inverted T-incision and layered preparation in depth. Finding the midline. Dissection of the musculature, which is dissected away to the side. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Exposing the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus on both sides, .................................... is ligated. Separation of the isthmus in the midline and exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp and preparation of a Björk flap. Subsequent circular suturing of the trachea in the sense of an epithelialized tracheotomy. The patient was then intubated and a size 7 tracheostomy tube was inserted. The patient was repositioned for neck dissection, initially on the right side. Incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth in layers after cutting through the platysma. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the digaster muscle. This reveals a large conglomerate of lymph nodes in the area of the venous angle. Numerous other lymph nodes can be found in the lateral neck preparation. First expose the cervical vascular sheath. Long-distance dissection of the vagus nerve, which is lifted out of its bed in the sense of a neurolysis and moved medially in a long distance. Re-embedding of the nerve here. Subsequent exposure of the accessory nerve and dissection of the lateral neck preparation of levels II, III, IV and V. Dissection of the anterior neck preparation with preservation of the branches of the internal jugular vein and the external carotid artery. Clearing of the hypoglossal triangle. Long dissection of the nerve and neurolysis. Re-embedding of the nerve after cranial displacement. Exposure of the submandibular capsule. This is subtotally removed. Subsequent exposure of the gland. Preservation of the facial artery and vein after they are first dissected away from the gland. The supplying vessels are cut off. The gland is then detached from the glandular bed. Circular dissection of the gland and exposure of the uncinate process and the excretory duct. Ligation of the excretory duct and subsequent removal of the gland. A tiny defect is revealed in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth, which is generously sutured over with floor of mouth muscles. Taping of the suture with TachoSil. Overall, the neck dissection of the right side revealed numerous suspicious nodules in the five levels. Irrigation of the wound and repeated palpation, whereupon no more enlarged lymph nodes were palpated. Insertion of a Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure bandage. Transition to the left side: Here, an arc-shaped skin incision is made along a neck fold. Here too, layer-by-layer dissection in depth after cutting through the platysma. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and long dissection of the vagus nerve. Neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the nerve. Clearing of the hypoglossal triangle after a small lymph node conglomerate is also revealed here. Long-term exposure Dissection of the hpyoglossal nerve, which is also re-embedded after neurolysis and cranial displacement. The accessorius nerve is also exposed. This is also dissected over a long distance and relocated after neurolysis. Re-embedding of the accessory nerve. Dissection of levels II and III, which are completely dissected. Subtle hemostasis. Irrigation of the wound. Insertion of a Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure bandage. Repositioning of the patient and enoral wound control. Subtle hemostasis again. The defect cannot be identified here. To prevent a fistula here, TachoSil is still applied to the posterior floor of the mouth. The TachoSil is fixed in place with a ball swab that is sewn on. If the wound is dry, the procedure is completed. Final consultation with the anesthetist.","Resection, Selective bilateral neck dissection, and Tracheotomy

An exophytic tumor mass was found in the area of the right piriform sinus, filling the entire piriform sinus and growing submucosally in a cranial direction. The aryepiglottic fold and the arytenoid cartilage on the right side are reached. The endolaryngeal pocket folds and vocal folds are tumor-free. The epiglottis is also tumor-free. However, the pharyngoepiglottic fold is also covered by the tumor. Esophageal entrance just clear. Then enter with the flexible esophagoscope and view into the stomach. No abnormalities here. PEG placement using the thread pull-through method with good diaphanoscopy - this was successful without any problems. Injection of Ultracaine in the neck area and sterile washing and draping. Then creation of an apron flap and start of neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digaster muscle. Then exposure of the nervus accessorius, the facial vein and the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the plexus branches and removal of the neck preparation II a to V a, sparing the plexus branches. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery and the external jugular vein. Then release of the cervical vascular sheath from the larynx. Separation of the superior laryngeal nerve, the artery and the superior laryngeal vein. Detachment of the thyroid gland from the larynx and change to the opposite side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. Then visualization of the facial vein and the internal jugular vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Then release of the medial neck block and visualization of the accessorius nerve and the plexus branches. Release the neck preparation II a to V a, sparing the plexus branches through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Perform the tracheotomy. To do this, enter the trachea, after severing the thyroid isthmus, between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage and create a mucocutaneous anastomosis in the caudal region. Re-intubation and pharyngotomy on the left side. Disluxation of the epiglottis and incision of the mucosa along the edge of the epiglottis. The tumor can be seen as described above. The tumor is resected with a safety margin of at least 1 cm to 1.5 cm in the pharyngeal region. Unfortunately, nothing of the larynx can be preserved, firstly because the arytenoid cartilage is infiltrated on the right side and secondly because the thyroid cartilage is extensively infiltrated on the right side and cannot be detached from the pharynx and the tumor at all. On the left side this was achieved without any problems. Now successive excision of the tumor, taking the laryngeal preparation with it. Removal of the larynx below the cricoid cartilage. It then becomes clear that the resection in the area of the esophageal entrance was very close, a large resection is taken here and then a final marginal specimen is taken again. At the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, the tumor is growing towards the soft tissue; here, too, the resection was very close. However, there is still a very thin, muscular displacement layer above the tumor. To be on the safe side, the infrahyoid musculature, which is located directly at this site, is resected again extensively and thickly and sent for final histology with a thread marker. The specimen is thread-marked and sent to the frozen section. In the frozen section, overall R0 situation, including the final edge sample at the esophageal entrance, this was discussed by telephone with the pathologists, a resection was not necessary at any point. A myotomy of the upper esophageal sphincter was performed. Now lifting of the radialis graft, 13 x 7 cm. Unfortunately, primary closure cannot be performed in the pharyngeal region as too little mucosa remains. The radialis graft is lifted in the usual way. First cut around the skin. Incision of the skin along the forearm up to the crook of the elbow. Then expose the venous star with the superficial venous system and locate the venous confluence with the deep venous system. Visualization of the brachioradialis muscle. Visualization of the radial superficial ramus nerve. Exposure of the radial artery. Clamping of the radial artery under pulse oximetric control - here always 100% saturation on the hand. Dissection of the radial artery and detachment of the graft from the tendons. Then dissect the pedicle in the usual way and place the radial artery graft in the crook of the elbow. Two different veins are lifted, one from the deep and one from the superficial system with preserved confluence. The graft is then sutured into the pharynx, which is of course somewhat difficult in the area of the base of the tongue and also in the area of the esophageal entrance. A pointed Z-plasty is performed here to counteract any subsequent esophageal inlet stenosis. Sutures are placed in the esophageal entrance for this purpose. Finally, the transplant is inserted with a precise fit. Repositioning to perform the anastomosis. The arterial anastomosis is performed via the superior thyroid, the venous anastomosis via the facial vein on the one hand and the external jugular vein on the other. Insertion of 2 Redon drains. Folding back of the apron flap and completion of suturing to the tracheostoma. Two-layer wound closure. At the end, another Doppler check in the area of the anastomosis and marking of the venous limb and the arterial limb for postoperative Doppler control. At the very end, another transoral inspection of the graft. This shows a very good blood supply to the graft. The operation is completed without difficulty. The patient is ventilated in the intensive care unit and is allowed to wake up the following day. Continue antibiotics for 24 hours. X-ray gruel swallow on the 10th postoperative day. If there is no fistula, please build up the diet, in the meantime feed via the PEG tube.","Laryngectomy, Partial pharyngectomy, PEG, Modified radical bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

Then, entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the tumor on the right side in the hypopharynx. The tumor is located on the medial wall of the hypopharynx and on the aryepiglottic fold. It is approx. 2 x 2 cm in size and exophytic, it can be easily adjusted, hence the decision to perform laser resection, which is then carried out. The tumor is now positioned with the spread laryngoscope and the edges of the incision are marked with a safety margin of 1.5 cm. The mucosa is then incised with the laser using 2 watts, then the laser intensity is increased to 3.5 watts and the tumor is lasered out. Care is taken to ensure that there is also a sufficient safety margin basally. In some cases, the tumor must be lasered down to the thyroid cartilage. The tumor specimen is then removed and marked in situ using a clip. The specimen is placed on cork and completely thread-marked for the frozen section. All margins are marked as R0 in the frozen section. Neck dissection on the right: repositioning of the patient by the surgeon. Injection in the area of the skin incision two fingers below the lower jaw. Care is taken to cut along the old scar line. Skin incision in the area of the old skin incision. Exposure of the platysma. This is difficult, as a clear scarring of the tissue can be seen in the area of the skin incision in the case of previous surgery. Identification of the platysma margin and subplatysmal dissection at the cranial and caudal wound margins for mobilization. Identification of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and sharp dissection along the anterior margin in depth. Identification of the omohyoid muscle and sharp dissection along the muscle cranially to the hyoid bone. Identification of the submandibular gland and opening of the capsule. Carefully hold the capsule away cranially and dissect along the digastric muscle to the hyoid bone. The medial neck preparation is subtly detached from the subsurface under constant bipolar coagulation. Identification of the jugular vein and sharp dissection on the vein from caudal to cranial, so that the neck preparation is divided at the lateral-medial part. Removal of the medial neck preparation after ligation of the facial vein. Exposure of the accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Gradual detachment of the lateral neck preparation from cranial to caudal, starting at level IIb while constantly protecting the surrounding structures, especially the accessorius nerve. There is a lymph node metastasis in the area of level IIb as well as in level III on the right side. The neck preparation is detached from cranial to caudal. Minor bleeding is coagulated bipolarly. The basal resection border is formed by the deep cervical fascia and the cervical plexus. The operation is completed without complications despite the overall very difficult dissection conditions due to the significant tissue scarring. Neck dissection on the left: Skin incision in a horizontal skin fold and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Separation of the platysma and subplatysmal dissection.

This is located in the piriform sinus and just reaches the aryepiglottic fold or arytenoid cartilage. Due to the location, resection with preservation of the larynx was planned and possible. Flap coverage also necessary. Patient was informed about ...........operative necessities.","First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The exophytic tumor is visible, which extends to the middle of the lateral wall of the left piriform sinus and extends medially to the arytenoid fold, but stops short of the arytenoid cartilage. The postcricoid area is not significantly involved. Tip of piriform sinus free macroscopically. Indication for surgery confirmed. The patient is now repositioned with all relevant surgical areas covered and disinfected. Firstly, insertion of the PEG: insertion of the flexible esophagoscope into the stomach, where no special features can be seen on rough inspection. After establishing the diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube without complications in a typical manner. Fixation to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Subsequent insertion of an apron flap in the typical manner. Then start of radical neck dissection on the left: Large lymph node metastasis or the metastatic conglomerate, which has grown together with the sternocleidomastoid muscle and with the soft tissue in depth, is revealed. Successive dissection of the lymph node conglomerate. The internal and external carotid arteries can be dissected. The superior thyroid artery must be dissected. The facial vein must be removed, as well as signs of infiltration into the internal jugular vein, which must also be resected. The vagus nerve is also firmly attached to the tumor in the middle area and visibly infiltrated, therefore it is also resected in the middle area. The accessory nerve cannot be preserved either. The hypoglossal nerve can be dissected and preserved. Dissection of the specimen together with all affected lymph nodes. Some branches of the cervical plexus are also affected, which must also be resected. However, the majority of the plexus can be preserved. All in all, levels II to V are removed. The muscles are then removed from the hyoid bone. The hyoid bone is resected for a better overview. Entering the pharyngeal tube above the epiglottis. Exposure of the tumor. The carcinoma can be seen, which is cut around with a safety margin of 2 to 2 ˝ cm, caudally even up to 3 cm. The pharyngeal wall falls from the tonsil pole to the tip of the sinus and medially from the area of the vallecula to the posterior wall. The tumor preparation shows a tumor cone in the direction of the laryngeal skeleton, but this can be dissected off in healthy tissue. The arytenoid cartilage is partially de-epithelialized at the edge. Here the tumor is somewhat closer than at the other margins, therefore a separate marginal sample is taken from the vallecula over the arytenoid region down to the piriform sinus entrance. Likewise, a marginal sample is taken basally from the soft parts of the larynx where the tumor cone reached. The tumor specimen is also sent in thread-marked for frozen section. Both edge samples are healthy, in the area of the tumor preparation there is still small, infiltrating tumor growth towards the tip of the sinus, where the largest safety distance was. Therefore, another approx. 1 cm wide marginal sample is taken from this area, which is marked remote from the tumor. No more infiltrates in the frozen section. However, there is moderate dysplasia in the entire mucosal area at the edge. Overall, a satellite-like, wallpaper-like, mosaic-like growth can be assumed. Due to the locally existing R0 resection, however, no more resections. Excision biopsy of a calcified thyroid nodule from the left lobe. Now palpation of the thyroid nodule on the left side. This is approx. 1.5 cm in diameter. Hard consistency. The tumor is now removed from the left lobe of the thyroid gland via an incision. Then careful hemostasis and closure of the thyroid lobe with 2-0 Vicryl single button sutures. The neck is now dissected on the right side: after exposing the omohyoid, digastric and sternocleidomastoid muscles, levels II to IV and parts of V a and b are removed. The internal and external carotid arteries and outgoing arteries as well as the facial vein, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve and the branches of the cervical plexus are all exposed and preserved. Surgery was performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequent tracheostoma creation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: After cutting the infrahyoid muscles, the thyroid isthmus is exposed. This is passed underneath, clamped off, severed and supplied in a typical manner using puncture ligatures. The trachea is then exposed. A modified, broadly pedicled Björk flap is created between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage. This is first epithelialized caudally. Subsequent reintubation. Tracheotomy was already performed before the final tumor resection. Then, after ensuring R0 resection, flap removal on the left forearm: Marking of the flap size, this is 10 x 8 cm. Marking of a skin monitor. Then first cut around the flap and the skin monitor as well as subcutaneous tissue subfascially from the ulna, then extend the incision into the crook of the elbow ..................................... Exposure of the superficial venous system with connection to the deep venous system. Subsequent incision of the flap from radial, subfascial. Exposure of the superficial cutaneous antebrachial nerve. Then exposure of the radial artery distally. Clamping of this. This is done for approx. 10 minutes, with stable saturation. Further removal of the flap in between. The radial artery is then removed. This is treated proximally and distally using 4-0 Prolene stitches. Lifting of the flap subfascially. Smaller arteries extending from the pedicle are clipped or bipolar coagulated. Dissection including the superficial venous system and the deep pedicle. A good but clearly medially located cephalic vein with 2 ends can be dissected in the antecubital fossa. The radial artery is dissected up to the entrance to the brachial artery. After clamping, the interosseous artery is left for a few minutes and closed with clips. The artery is then removed first. This is closed with 6-0 Vascufil sutures towards the brachial artery. Clamp and ligature the veins. The flap is then flushed with heparin solution. The arm is then closed in layers in the cranial area after careful hemostasis. A 0.7 to 0.8 mm thick split-thickness skin graft was obtained from the thigh, which is now successively incorporated into the forearm defect. Here complete closure. Sewing on swabs. Application of octenidine gel and application of cloud compresses. Then wrap with absorbent cotton. Fitting of a Kramer splint and fixation with an elastic bandage. Re-application of the arm. Saturation always close to or at 100% until the end of the operation. Subsequent insertion of the flap into the defect. The flap is inserted in such a way that the stalk on the opposite side can be anastomosed with the vessels. Successive suturing of the flap into the defect, partly with the sutures in place, using 3-0 Vicryl single-button sutures. The defect is closed without tension. The stalk is transferred to the opposite side. The superior thyroid artery is shown here. This is sutured to the radial artery after appropriate conditioning using 8-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Due to the different lumen, this must be done twice before a ......................... pulsation of the pedicle can be achieved. Then dissection of the 2 venous outlets from the superficial venous system and 2 outlets from the area of the facial vein. After conditioning, the first larger vein is anastomosed with the outgoing facial vein using a 4-0 coupler. The smaller outlet is also anastomosed with the smaller outlet from the stalk using a 2.5 mm coupler. Good venous return after opening the clamps in each case, positive smear phenomenon. After completion of the vascular anastomoses, strong pulse in the pedicle area and venous return. Subsequent positioning of the pedicle, careful irrigation and hemostasis. Wound closure by retraction of the apron flap. Caudal completion of the epithelialization of the stoma. Lateral cervical closure on the left by placing a Redon drainage, on the right by placing 2 flaps. Re-intubation and insertion of an 8 mm tracheostomy tube. This is fixed with sutures. At the end of the operation, arterial and venous flow could be observed very well with the Doppler. The skin monitor was sutured into the apron flap via a small incision in the ventral neck skin without tension and also showed a very good aspect. The procedure was completed without complications. Patient received Unacid 3 g preoperatively and again during the operation. Antibiotics should be continued for 1 week. Nutrition should be provided via the PEG tube already in place for at least 10 days. Then gruel should be swallowed and, if necessary, the diet should be built up. Heparin perfusor therapy started intraoperatively at 500 units per hour should be continued postoperatively for 5 days. Doppler control according to the scheme for 5 days incl. assessment of the skin monitor. Change the dressing on the forearm, if possible, only after 5 to 7 days. The hydrogel thigh bandage that was finally applied can be left in place for 3 to 4 days or changed depending on the findings. Please loosen the PEG the next day in the typical manner. Wait for the histology from the left lobe of the thyroid gland and then proceed according to the findings. Overall cT2 to 3 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the left with infiltration up to the edge of the larynx. Therefore, the epiglottis margin, aryepiglottic fold, vallecula and parts of the laryngeal skeleton were also removed. Flap coverage by means of a radial flap. Extensive left cervical lymph node metastasis. Therefore, postoperative presentation in the interdisciplinary tumor conference on the question of postoperative radiochemotherapy. Due to the surgical measures, initiate swallowing rehabilitation at an early stage.","Transoral tumor resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

The findings are intraoperatively suspicious for a tumor. Careful bipolar coagulation and removal of the upper tonsil pole with the raspatory and conchotomy scissors. If the findings are suspicious for a tumor, perform a generous resection up to the pharyngeal muscles. Further dissection of the tonsil towards the lower tonsil pole. Generous resection 2 to 3 mm lateral to the resection margin. Bipolar coagulation at the lower tonsil pole and removal of the tonsil. The specimen is thread-marked for urgent histology. At this point, demonstration of the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME> and termination of the procedure in dry conditions.

Clear destruction of the cartilage on CT. Laryngectomy was therefore indicated.,"Preparation and intubation by anesthesia colleagues. First positioning of the patient, preliminary consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. First perform a pharyngo-laryngoscopy. This involves entering with the Kleinsasser tube under dental protection. The tumorous process is seen in the endolaryngeal region, particularly anteriorly located with infiltration of both vocal folds and clear growth towards the laryngeal skeleton. Therefore, in conjunction with the CT diagnosis, confirmation of the indication for laryngectomy. No evidence of infiltration of the supraglottic structures and extension towards the hypopharynx. Here, all mucosa is unremarkable and tumor-free. A nasogastric feeding tube was then inserted under pharyngoscopic control. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. Dissection of an apron flap. Exposure of both sides of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Due to the course, the facial vein is removed in good time. Neck dissection performed first. Start with the left side. Here, after exposure of the omohyoid muscle, free preparation of the internal jugular vein, exposure of the vagus nerve, common carotid artery, clearing of the anterior neck preparation while carefully protecting the cervical anus, the hypoglossal nerve and the superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and en bloc removal of the neck preparation. All exposed nerve structures are returned to their tissue bed after release. Exactly the same procedure on the opposite side. Here too, the accessorius nerve, vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve are exposed. Subsequent neurolysis and re-embedding of the structures. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein and, together with level VI, removal of the neck preparation en block. Skeletonization of the laryngeal skeleton and release on both sides of the piriform sinus, release of the hyoid. This is followed by the trachatomy. This is done between the cricoid cartilage and the first tracheal ring. The thyroid isthmus is severed for this purpose. Successive release of the left thyroid lobe, which was clearly conspicuous due to nodules measuring up to 2 cm. This can be correlated well with the sonographic findings intraoperatively. Visualization of the recurrent nerve. Ligation of the thyroid gland close to the capsule. Ligation of the superior and inferior thyroid artery and the middle thyroid vein. The tumor is then resected. This involves entering the center of the vallecula, looping the epiglottis and successively widening the pharyngeal access. Mucosa-sparing resection and release of the laryngeal skeleton and removal of the laryngeal skeleton below the cricoid cartilage. Careful inspection. The glottic laryngeal carcinoma is exclusively endolaryngeal. This results in a safe in sano resection. The Provox prosthesis is then placed using the usual pull-through method. This is successful without any problems. Insertion of a 6 mm prosthesis. The paramedian myotomy is then performed in the area of the upper esophageal sphincter. Later, the sternal attachments of the sternocleidomastoid muscle are cut on both sides. The pharyngeal suture is then performed inverted and in multiple layers. Subsequently, insertion of a 10-gauge redon drain in each case. Careful two-layer wound closure and suturing of the tracheostoma.

On CT, there is evidence of esophageal infiltration, a breakthrough through the thyroid cartilage is clearly visible, so that there is an indication for laryngectomy and probable partial pharyngectomy with flap plasty.","First head positioning. Pharyngoscopy after insertion of the mouthguard. An exophytic mass is seen starting at the entrance to the hypopharynx, growing into the endolarynx and affecting both sides of the glottic plane. Caudally, the tumor extends to the upper esophageal orifice. An infiltration cannot be ruled out with complete certainty after multiple diagnostic assessments and consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, but resection appears to be possible here. In summary of all findings, decision to proceed with curative surgical treatment. Skin disinfection without infiltration anesthesia in known CHD. Formation of an apron flap. Double ligation of the external jugular vein. Dissection with exposure of both submandibular glandulae. Rearrangement and neck dissection on the left side: Dissection of the sternocleidomastoid. Finding the accessorius nerve, which is spared in the further course. From caudal to cranial then development of the lateral neck preparation with removal of regions V, IV, III, II and Ib. The jugular vein, the accessorius nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, the superior thyroid artery and the carotid artery are freed from connective tissue structures and their course is visualized, identified and spared. The superior thyroid artery is dissected after its caudal exit, doped and stitched. The superior laryngeal nerve is also identified as it enters the larynx together with the accompanying vessels and removed. Now mobilize the lateral laryngeal skeleton. Separate the infralaryngeal muscles and strike downwards. Mobilization of the left thyroid pole from the laryngeal skeleton, beating laterally after separation and ligation of the isthmus. Exposure of the left-sided hyoid bone. Exposure of the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage and the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage as well as the superior cornu. This is exposed and the constrictor, already pushed off on the inside, in preparation for the laryngectomy step. Transfer to the opposite side after hemostasis. Identical procedure on the right side. Identification of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the accessorius nerve. Protection of both structures during the procedure. The vascular sheath and the internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery are also shown here. Cranial placement of the borders with identification of the digastric muscle through the apron flap. Dissection from caudal to cranial in levels V, IV and III. It can now be seen that a metastatic conglomerate of 3 nodes is located in the jugulofacial angle on the internal jugular vein and appears to infiltrate it. It is not possible to dissect the conglomerate from the vein sharply or bluntly without risking a lesion. Therefore, cranially locate the end of the vein and caudally remove the conglomerate after double ligation and repositioning. Identification of the hypoglossal nerve. This is also spared in the further course. Completion of the neck in levels II and III and ventral removal of connective tissue. The infralaryngeal musculature is not removed here, as infiltration by underlying tumor parts cannot be ruled out. Dissection of the carotid and residual venous parts as well as the vagus nerve, which are folded further laterally and spared, and mobilization of the constrictor muscles caudally. Now repositioning for tracheotomy. Exposure of the surgical site caudally. Insertion into the trachea between the 1st and 2nd tracheal clasp. Placement of 2 holding sutures. Further mobilization of the left thyroid lobe caudally and mobilization of the laryngeal preparation from the left and right. For this purpose, also identify the right-sided hyoid bone parts and separate them sharply with the electric knife. Also on the right side, attempt to expose the cornu superius of the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, but this is not done due to the large tumor so as not to open the tumor. In the median plane, entry into the pre-epiglottic fatty tissue. Identification of the epiglottis and disluxation with the tumor grasping forceps. Now, starting from the healthy side, release the laryngectomy specimen from cranial to caudal with the right-sided hypopharyngeal carcinoma inside. Under visualization and leaving a macroscopically healthy mucosa and muscle layer, consecutive removal under bipolar coagulation. The specimen is submitted as a whole for frozen section and R0 diagnosis. The specimen grows to the left side before entering the upper esophageal sphincter, so that only a small pharyngeal tube remains here. According to <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the pathology department, parts of a carcinoma in situ are still found at the lateral central resection margin, so that 2 resections are taken here as a margin sample. As further resection is not possible under any circumstances, we do not wait for a frozen section diagnosis, but continue with the operation and send the samples for urgent histological processing. The decision is now made to cover the defect using a pectoralis major flap: Marking of the blood vessel supply and the medially overlying skin island, which is measured beforehand. First incision at the lateral edge of the pectoralis major and identification of the supplying arterial areas. Then cut around the skin area caudally. Adaptation with Vicryl sutures of the flap epithelium with the muscle. Mobilization of a tunnel and connection to the neck access under constant view of the supplying artery. Fluxing through the flap and now double-layer inverted suturing of the flap and the resection area at all points. A T-shaped suture is first created at the base of the tongue to enable tension-free suturing. The remaining adaptation is now very successful. In the cranial area towards the base of the tongue, a third row of sutures for complete wound closure. Now complete the tracheostoma suture using Ethibond. Two-layer wound closure after placement of Redon drains in the flap removal area. Two-layer wound closure on both cervical sides after placement of 2 Redon drains. On the right cervical side in the area of the flap pedicle, the skin is not closed in order to avoid compression of the feeding vessels. Lomatuell is applied here. The patient received Unacid 3 g every 8 hours intraoperatively; this should be continued for 5 days. As far as swallowing function is concerned, with subsequent radiotherapy, complaints are certainly to be expected in the context of this maximum reconstruction. The gastric tube should be removed between the 7th and 10th postoperative day after an X-ray pre-swallow. In any case, postoperative radiotherapy if borderline in sano resection is possible at all. Voice rehabilitation can be attempted by means of ructus, but here too the chances of success are rather critical. Termination of the operation.","Neck revision with submandibulectomy

This reveals a tumor of the left anterior palatal arch, the tonsil, which then extends over the vallecula to the hypopharynx. However, the piriform sinus of the left side is completely omitted by the tumor. The same applies to the entire right side of the hypopharynx and oropharynx. The tumor certainly does not reach the midline of the soft palate. From the tonsil, the tumor passes slightly onto the glossotonsillar groove. First adjust and expose the tumor with the FK retractor. Then start resection at the anterior palatal arch. From here, dissection down to the tonsil, which is then resected with tissue surrounding the tonsil capsule in the sense of a tumor tonsillectomy. The pharyngeal musculature is exposed. There is no evidence of deep tumor growth. The tumor is then developed further caudally. Here resection of the glossotonsillar groove with transition of the resection to the base of the tongue. A part of the base of the tongue is also resected here. Further dissection then caudally, towards the hypopharynx, where the tumor can then be safely removed at the entrance to the piriform sinus. Now take samples from the margins at the entrance to the piriform sinus, the anterior and posterior margins and the base of the tongue. It then becomes apparent that the tumor reaches the lingual epiglottis via the vallecula, so that a corresponding part of the lingual epiglottis is resected here as well. Now also take a marginal sample at the resection margin of the epiglottis. The area of the entrance of the piriform sinus at the front and at the epiglottis is then assessed by the pathologist as a carcinoma in situ in the frozen section, so that another resection is performed here. A resection is then performed on the epiglottis and the anterior piriform sinus entrance. If the mucosal aspect is absolutely inconspicuous macroscopically, the corresponding marginal samples are taken again from the epiglottis and the anterior piriform sinus entrance. When the marginal sample is taken, there is a somewhat heavier bleeding here from the depths, which can only be controlled with difficulty using monopolar coagulation. The area of the resection site can now hardly be exposed with the FK retractor, so that it is then decided not to carry out any further resection in depth, regardless of the result of the histological findings of the frozen section examination. If the wound is dry, all instruments are then removed. Then reposition the patient by tracheotomy. Perform a pretracheal transverse incision and then dissect in layers in depth. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Then separate the infrahyoid and infralaryngeal muscles at the midline. Clamping of the thyroid isthmus and separation of the thyroid muscle as well as bilateral repositioning. Then expose the anterior surface of the trachea, open the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp, prepare a Björk flap and then suture the tracheostoma in a circular fashion, followed by reintubation onto an 8-gauge cannula. The intraoperative frozen section at the epiglottis is then assessed as tumor-free. The frozen section in the area of the resection site on the piriform sinus on the anterior wall is again described as carcinoma in situ. However, since a left neck dissection is required anyway in this patient with a positive lymph node status on the left side of the neck, another transoral laser resection should be performed in the area of the piriform sinus anterior wall on the left side in connection with this procedure. The procedure is therefore completed at this point. After extubation, the patient returns to the normal ward of the ENT clinic.","Transoral, robot-assisted resection, and Tracheotomy

Intraoperative cT1a extension with questionable transition to the supraglottis. No clearly definable tumor on computed tomography, certainly no cartilage erosion or infiltration. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, primary surgical treatment was decided.","After induction and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, the Kleinsasser tube is inserted under dental protection after inspection of the inconspicuous oral vestibule. The oral cavity and pharynx are then inspected and found to be normal. Adjustment of the endolarynx with the aid of the surgical microscope. An exophytic, partially ulcerated tumor is seen in the area of the glottis on the right, which grows almost along the entire length of the vocal fold on the right side, the anterior commissure is free. Adherence in the area of the posterior commissure towards Ary, but without further signs of infiltration here. The tumor grows clearly laterally, infiltrates and partially consumes the pocket fold. The ventriculus laryngis is used up. However, the tumor can still be displaced over the fold of the larynx by palpation. Demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and confirmation of the primary surgical procedure. Resection is now performed with the 2-5 Watt laser. Inclusion of the pocket fold, which is almost completely resected, allowing the tumor, which clearly infiltrates the ventriculis laryngis in depth, to be resected in sano. Subtotal resection of the paralaryngeal musculature. Finally, healthy conditions on all sides in depth. Separation in the area of the anterior commissure, leaving a minimal residual vocal fold anteriorly on the right. Dorsal resection including the vocal process. The tumor is attached to the vocal process. However, complete mobilization and exclusion of further arytenoid infiltration by resection of the processus. Removal of the tumor in toto. Careful hemostasis. Subsequent representative marginal sampling in all planes, especially in the paraglottic direction and in the area of the arytenoid. All marginal samples are free of dysplasia and tumors in the frozen section diagnostics, so that an R0 situation can be assumed here. Final inspection and with absolutely dry and slim glottic conditions, the procedure was completed without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperatively R0 resected cT2 glottic carcinoma on the right. After receiving the definitive histology, discussion of the adjuvant therapy options, also with regard to the extension with infiltration of the pocket fold, in our interdisciplinary tumor conference and if no further measures are taken, a control microlaryngoscopy should be performed in approx. 8 weeks.","Endoscopic laser resection, Microlaryngoscopy

Here, circumscribed growth on the mandibular branch without evidence of mandibular infiltration in the panendoscopy or CT imaging. Now planned resection and defect coverage using a radial flap.","First, perform the PEG insertion. For this purpose, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. Here, with good diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. Inspection of the oesophagus on reflection. No suspicious lesions here. Now enter with the small bore tube and inspect the primary tumor with the small bore tube and the open mouth retractor. There is an exophytic growing tumor in the area of the right anterior palatal arch, passing over the glossotonsillar groove to the base of the tongue and clearly infiltrating it in depth, affecting at least 1/4 of the base of the tongue, but free vallecula and epiglottis caudally. No growth towards the hypopharynx. The tumor extends over the glossotonsillar groove onto the alveolar ridge and is located here coarsely and not displaceable. In this case, the tumor tends to grow submucosally and nodularly and is located at least 3 cm above the mandible. Urgent suspicion of mandibular infiltration here. Tumor extends anteriorly in a bumpy shape. A screening specimen was taken at the anterior margin for frozen section diagnosis. However, no tumor growth here. Now consult <CLINICIAN_NAME> and discuss the case. Confirmation of the overall clear tumor progression and the high degree of suspicion of mandibular infiltration. Therefore, after detailed case discussion, decision to consult the maxillofacial surgeons. Findings demo and case discussion by telephone to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Confirmation of suspected mandibular infiltration. Primary treatment recommendation of continuous partial mandibular resection. Joint case discussion again with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Due to the thinning and lack of adequate curative treatment options for surgical restoration, the decision was made to perform primary surgical restoration with the recommended partial mandibular resection and reconstruction using a scapula flap. Neck dissection and tracheotomy performed first. Start with the neck dissection on the left side: no suspicious masses are described sonographically. Skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Clearing out the anterior neck level while carefully protecting the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve and the cervical sinus. Now expose the internal jugular vein. Free preparation of the vein after prior exposure of the accessorius nerve. Exposure and preservation of the facial vein, the external vein was ligated and removed in the course of the oblique pulling exit. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches and special protection of caudal lymphatic structures. Dry conditions here. Final inspection and in dry conditions, after final palpation of level Ib and inconspicuous conditions, wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and two-layer wound closure after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Now turn to the neck dissection on the opposite side: here sonographically 2 suspicious masses level II to IV. In principle the same procedure. Dissection of skin and subcutaneous tissue, dissection of the platysma, creation of a platysma flap. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This can be removed from the nodular metastatic lesions measuring up to 3 cm on the internal jugular vein. No evidence of muscle infiltration here. Visualization of the omohyoid muscle. Expose the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, cervical artery and hypoglossal nerve. There is no real facial vein here, but there is a very strong superior thyroid vein. Free dissection of the internal jugular vein, including the suspicious lesions. Careful dissection in the area of the vein. Clearly no infiltration of the vessel here, but vulnerable conditions. Outlets close to the vein must be ligated twice. Otherwise problem-free evacuation. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Evacuation of the accessorius triangle and evacuation of level V with careful protection of the plexus branches. Further exposure of the external carotid artery. Exposure of the outlet of the upper laryngeal bundle and the facial vein. Now, due to the expansion, evacuation of level Ib. This is done with the submandibular gland. Careful subcapsular dissection while keeping the branch of the mouth away. Careful dissection and protection of the facial artery. A lymph node measuring a good 1 1/2 cm anterior to the gland is noticeable, otherwise no macroscopically suspicious changes in level Ib. Palpation of the floor of the mouth. No changes here. Now, with dry wound conditions, first turn to the tracheotomy. Make a horizontal incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose and ligate the strong anterior jugular vein in this area. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Dissection of the musculature, exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Bipolar coagulation of the thyroid isthmus and, after complete exposure of the anterior tracheal surface, insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Subsequent problem-free transfer to an 8 mm tracheoflex cannula and fixation of the cannula with suture. Now use <CLINICIAN_NAME> from maxillofacial surgery until osteocutaneous fixation of the graft. The mandibular branch is now sharply visualized. If the course of the mandible is tortuous, remove the facial artery as distally as possible to obtain a strong vascular stump and expose a large area of the mandibular branch ............ of the periosteum and muscle insertions. Exposure of the ascending mandibular branch up to the joint, complete freeing of the mandibular branch from the muscle processes. Now, after complete exposure, saw out approx. 6 cm of mandible after previous fixation with 2.7 from the synthesis plate, which is fixed with 12 and 14 screws. Sawing out the bone portion. This results in a circumscribed detachment of bone in the area of the mandibular angulus. This is later refixed with osteosynthesis and screws. Re-release of the plate. Therefore creation of a wide access. Entering enorally in the area of the anterior floor of the mouth. Successive resection of the tumor, taking the lateral floor of the mouth and the edge of the tongue completely up to the base of the tongue. Here, generous resection with resection of approx. 1/3 of the base of the tongue. Macroscopically and palpatorily clearly healthy. Resection towards the soft tissues of the cheek well within the healthy tissue. Resection of the tumor including the anterior palatal arch and the tonsil as far as the parauvular region, but sparing the posterior palatal arch. After caudal resection up to just before the epiglottis and also here resection of the tumor clearly in healthy tissue. Now, after extirpation of the tumor, a clear in sano resection can be seen macroscopically. Only in the area of the anterior floor of the mouth macroscopically somewhat scarce resection. Therefore, a strong resection is performed in the area of the anterior floor of the mouth. Finally, the tumor area is completely covered with continuous margin samples. These are sent for frozen section diagnostics and assessed here as completely free of tumor and dysplasia. Therefore, after meticulous hemostasis, sterile packing of the wound conditions and repositioning to elevate an osteomyocutaneous scapula flap. A separate dictation from <CLINICIAN_NAME> from the MKG follows. After removal of the graft, preparation of the vascular pedicle. Successive fitting of the bony part. Difficult conditions here, but finally good fitting in the area of the bony margins. After osteosynthetic treatment, insertion of cancellous bone tissue. Final firm fit. Previous transcervical suturing of the cutaneous part in the area of the base of the tongue and the caudal pharyngeal defect as well as beginning in the area of the posterior palatal arch. Attempt to complete the cutaneous suture transorally. This is not successful due to increased tension. Therefore, renewed anterior loosening of the plating. In the meantime, renewed demonstration of findings at <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. With good mobilization of the cutaneous part, problem-free transoral insertion of the graft. Finally, complete defect coverage in the area of the mucosal defect. In the area of the anterior floor of the mouth and the tongue, primary mucosal adaptation is described here, finally also palpably completely dense conditions. Repositioning of the plating. Renewed screwing. Insertion of spongiosis, circumscribed, and attention to microvascular anastomization: For this purpose, initially further exposure of the vascular pedicle. Clipping of vessels close to the stalk. After dissection, positioning of the detached facial artery with approximate caliber equivalence. Excellent flow after free dissection and placement. Free preparation of the vessel and now, after placement, perform end-to-end anastomosis with 8.0 ethinol. This is somewhat more difficult with vessels that are not exactly the same caliber, but is ultimately successful. Initially delayed venous return. After a short run-in phase, however, excellent reflux conditions with enorally regular flap perfusion. Now, after positioning of the arterial anastomosis, the best possible placement conditions for anastomization with the external jugular vein. Therefore, free preparation of the external jugular vein. Deposition after ligation. Free preparation. Measurement of a 3.5 mm coupler and problem-free execution of the coupler anastomosis. After opening the Acland clamps, immediate regular venous filling and excellent flap perfusion. Finally, circumscribed hemostasis in the area of the previously thinned muscle cuff and, in dry conditions and with good flap vitality, careful two-layer wound closure with moderate tension conditions. Due to the large area of exposed musculature in the area of the muscular graft part, the caudal part is left open cervically. Insertion of a flap and suturing and termination of the procedure at this point. Conclusion: Due to the high degree of suspicion of mandibular infiltration and the lack of equivalent curative treatment options, resection of a cT4a cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right with continuity resection of the mandible and reconstruction of the osseous defect as well as reconstruction of the enoral defect with an osseomyocutaneous scapular flap. Due to the extent of the tumor, adjuvant therapy is certainly required. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g. Please continue this postoperatively with Unacid 1.5 g for 3 days. Postoperatively, please monitor the flap meticulously according to the known scheme. Please visit the maxillofacial clinic approx. 1 week postoperatively for an X-ray overview. From the 8th postoperative day, endoscopic check-up and, if flap vitality is normal and the conditions are dense, a clinical swallowing test and, if necessary, oral food preparation.

Performing a microlaryngoscopy, where a broad-based tumor is found relatively centrally in the area of the base of the tongue, which here bulges strongly exophytically into the pharynx. The lateral wall of the pharynx is merely adjacent to the tumor, as is the posterior wall of the pharynx, where there is certainly no infiltration by the tumor. Removal of the MLE tube. Perform gastroscopy and PEG insertion. The flexible instrument can be inserted into the esophagus without any problems, and the tube can be advanced under visualization into the stomach, where a regular folded relief can be seen. After distension of the stomach, a positive diaphanoscopy reveals a good puncture site below the costal arch. Here the PEG tube is placed using the thread pull-through method and with a positive tent phenomenon. This is successful without any problems. Fixation of the PEG tube with the holding plate and dressing. Reflect back and inspect the esophageal mucosa, which is unremarkable. Repositioning of the patient and insertion of the size B small bore tube and exploration of the base of the tongue. This is only insufficiently successful, so the small water tube is changed to the TORS barrier. This allows sufficient exposure of the tumor so that laser resection can now be performed successively. The resection is carried out far into the base of the tongue, as there is considerable infiltration of the tumor here. Due to the complexity, a large part of the exophytic part of the tumor must be resected first. It is now possible to expose the base of the tumor better and to laser the tumor out of the base of the tongue. The tumor is located so centrally that the lingual artery is not endangered on either side, even with deep resection. Representative frozen sections are taken, whereby a marginal sample in the area of the base of the tongue proves to be positive. This area is resected again generously and finally another marginal sample is taken, which is found to be tumor-free by the pathologists in the frozen section during the further course of the resection. Subtle hemostasis. The resection is performed via the vallecula up to the lingual epiglottis surface. The base of the epiglottis is also infiltrated by the tumor. However, the cartilage is certainly affected so that the tumor can ultimately be completely resected while preserving the epiglottis. Representative marginal samples for frozen section diagnostics are also taken from the area of the vallecula and the epiglottis, all of which are found to be tumor-free intraoperatively. Repeated subtle hemostasis. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection on both sides and tracheotomy. Application of local anesthesia on both sides of the neck. Skin ablation of the entire neck and sterile draping. Start on the right side. Creation of a skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle caudally and the digaster muscle (posterior cranial venter). Exposure of the cranial accessorius nerve. Displacement and at the end of the operation re-embedding of the accessorius nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the cranial hypoglossal nerve. Displacement and at the end of the operation re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath from caudal to cranial up to the digaster. Successive removal of the posterior and then anterior neck specimen containing the lymph nodes. Protection of the above-mentioned structures. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Irrigation of the wound using hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Dry conditions. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure dressing. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection on the left. Creation of a skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure and ligation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Dissection along the omohyoid muscle cranially to the hyoid bone and the capsule of the submandibular gland. Cranial exposure of the posterior venter of the digaster muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection along the internal jugular vein, the vagus nerve and the common carotid artery from caudal to cranial up to the digaster. Displacement and at the end of the operation re-embedding of the vagus nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. A highly suspicious lymph node is found in the area of the upper venous angle, which is also removed with the neck preparation. Another suspicious lymph node is found in region IV on the left side. Successive removal of the posterior neck specimen while sparing the above-mentioned structures and the plexus branches. Removal of the anterior neck specimen. Repeated inspection. Irrigation of the wound with hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Dry conditions. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Platysma suture. Single button skin suture. Application of a pressure bandage. Subsequent creation of an approx. 3.5 cm long incision below the cricoid cartilage. Separation of the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of both branches of the anterior jugular vein, which are ligated separately. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Lateral displacement of the prelaryngeal musculature on the right and left. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, which is undermined, clamped and severed. Subsequently, both sides are treated by means of re-stitching. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Creation of a Björ flap in a typical manner after incision between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasp. Creation of a plastic tracheostoma. Skin suture. Re-intubation of the patient to a size 8 tracheostomy tube. Regular conditions. Application of a pressure bandage. Completion of the procedure without complications.

PET-CT showed a left tonsil focus. Surgery therefore indicated.,"First of all, another pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: There is no further clinical evidence of a mass, apart from the hardening in the area of the left tonsil. However, a tonsil stone had been retrieved here during the pre-panendoscopy. However, an indurated tonsil was found, the induration also extends into the soft tissue slightly outside the left tonsil. Therefore, clear cutting outside the tonsil border cranially and also laterally as well as to the depth, entraining mucosa and also muscle tissue. Successive removal of the tonsil and attached soft tissue macroscopically clearly in healthy tissue, in the sense of an extended tonsillectomy. Resection caudally to the base of the tongue. The muscles, including the pterygoid muscles, are removed towards the depths. The posterior palatal arch can initially be completely preserved, while the anterior arch is completely resected. Muscle parts in the palatal arch area are also preserved. The specimen is marked with sutures. Separate cranial medial and cranial lateral margin specimens as soft tissue margin specimens. In the frozen section with infiltrations, which form margins in the cranial and medial areas. The two soft tissue margin samples towards the depth are healthy. Therefore, recutting of mucosal strips with attached soft tissue cranially in the entire area and medially. Tumor is marked with suture in each case remote from the tumor. No more infiltrates in the frozen section, so now R0 resection. In view of the situation, neck dissection is now also possible and indicated. Injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline. Sterile draping. Skin incision including the old scar. Laborious dissection through the scar tissue. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the digastric and omohyoid muscles. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure and preservation of the facial vein. Exposure and preservation of the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery. Visualization and preservation of the vagus nerve. Extreme scarring anterior to the vein or artery around the facial vein and around the capsule of the submandibular gland. This is dissected free. Level II to V are then evacuated while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Finally, careful hemostasis. Irrigation. Wound closure with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures and 4-0 skin sutures and insertion of a Redon drain. Subsequent enoral inspection. No bleeding. The procedure was completed without complications. Overall cT1 to 2, more likely cT2 tonsillar carcinoma on the left, R0 according to marginal samples. Neck dissection at least cN1.

If the conditions are normal, the patient can be intubated without any problems. Subsequent endoscopy of the patient's oral cavity, pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx, revealing a highly exophytic mass originating from the left tonsil. Cranial to this mass there are smaller exophytic islands in the mucosal level of the soft palate. These do not reach the uvula. Otherwise, the mucosa is completely normal and inconspicuous in the entire mirror area. A representative sample is then taken for frozen section diagnostics. The findings are diagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma. Then insertion of the Olympus retractor and exposure of the tonsil together with the tumor on the left side. Then insertion of the robotic arms and start of the TORS resection. The dissection is also performed using a monopolar spatula. Start of resection on the soft palate. Resection is performed up to the parauvular level. First resection laterally in the region of the anterior palatal arch and then dorsally in the region of the posterior palatal arch. Dissection is performed with subtle hemostasis up to the lower tonsil pole. The tumor is then deposited here with a sufficient safety margin below the lower tonsil pole. The specimen is then thread-marked as a whole for histopathological tissue examination. In the frozen section, the finding of an rCIS finding with micro-islands of invasive carcinoma in the area of the margin of the posterior palatal arch, in particular in the caudal region of the margin extending beyond the middle to the cranial side, is found. Subsequent resection of a strip from the posterior palatal arch to the caudal settling area. A strip of mucosa is then removed as a new representative marginal sample, with the suture markings placed cranially in each case. This new marginal sample is then also found to be tumor-free intraoperatively as a frozen section, so that an R0 resection can now be assumed here. Now that there is a somewhat larger defect in the posterior palatal arch, a uvuloplasty is performed to reconstruct the posterior soft palate. This is then followed by subtle hemostasis and removal of the robotic instruments. After checking the bleeding again, the oral retractor is also removed. The patient is then repositioned for neck dissection on the left side. Here, the skin incision is first made along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Then dissect in depth in layers and expose the neck vessel sheath. Free preparation of the cervical vascular sheath and preparation of the lateral neck preparation as well as preparation of all resection borders in the sense of the omohyoid muscle, the capsule of the submandibular gland and the digaster muscle. A suspicious lymph node change can then be seen in the accessorius triangle. This area is then initially removed here in the sense of a level IIa evacuation while sparing the accessorius nerve. Then further development of the entire lateral neck preparation in the sense of level III and IV. Then clearing of the hypoglossal triangle while sparing the hypoglossal nerve and the branches of the external carotid artery and internal jugular artery in the sense of clearing Level Ib and the posterior margin Level Ia. Then complete dissection of the anterior neck preparation in the sense of level V, also with careful dissection of the branches of the external carotid artery and internal jugular artery. Subsequent subtle hemostasis and irrigation of the wound. Insertion of a Redon drain and subsequent two-layer wound closure and dressing. The patient is then extubated without any problems after the procedure has been completed.

Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, undercutting of this, clamping, severing and treatment using puncture ligatures. Subsequent visualization of the trachea. Entering the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Creation of a modified Björk flap with a wide base. This is epithelized in the typical manner. Subsequently reintubation and insertion of a size 8 tracheal tube, which is fixed with sutures. Then after measuring the defect, which is 11 x 6-7 cm. Mark the size and shape of the flap on the left forearm. Then first lift the flap subfascially from the ulnar side. Then extend the incision into the crook of the elbow. Expose the superficial venous system and connection to the deep venous system. Subfascial elevation of the superficial venous system. Subsequent elevation of the flap subfascially from the radial side. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. Subsequent exposure of the radial artery. After clamping and waiting, no change in the saturation of the hand, which is always 100% in this case. Deposition of the radial artery. Successive elevation of the radial artery flap with ligation or bipolar coagulation or clipping of vessels. The vascular pedicle is dissected up to the antecubital fossa. Good confluence can be visualized here. Connection to the superficial venous system. A large cephalic vein with ends on the superficial venous system. Finally, the flap is removed. Veins are ligated. Confluence is additionally clipped. The interosseous artery is clipped after waiting for saturation. The radial artery is treated at the entrance to the brachial artery using 6-0 Vascufil sutures. The flap is flushed with heparin and preserved. In the forearm, after extensive hemostasis, the skin is first closed proximally in the typical manner and a Redon drain is inserted. A piece of split skin is then removed from the thigh with the dermatome in the typical manner. Hydrocolloid dressing is then applied. Split skin is worked into the defect. Here complete tension-free defect coverage. Relief incisions. Application of swabs. Application of octenidine gel and Mepilex. The arm is then covered with compresses and wrapped in absorbent cotton. Application and fitting of a Cramer splint. This is fixed in a functional position with a tape bandage. Hand is in 100% saturation. Subsequent positioning of the arm. Radialis flap is successively worked into the defect with 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. The pedicle is inserted anteriorly in the area of the defect. The digastric muscles were also cut from below. Other parts of the muscles of the floor of the mouth, including the submandibular gland, were also removed to enlarge the tunnel. The submandibular gland was removed because the sublingual gland and the entire wharton's duct were also resected, as was the lingual nerve. All removed parts of the floor of the mouth muscles and the submandibular gland are preserved and sent for histology as another final marginal sample. The mucosa in the right floor of the mouth area is incised and the Wharton's duct is incised and marsupialized. The flap is sutured over here in the typical manner. After the flap has been completely sutured without tension and the pedicle has been passed into the soft tissues of the neck, the facial artery is selected, as the lumen of the superior thyroid artery is too small for connection to the radial artery. The radial artery is anastomosed with the facial artery after conditioning with single 9-button Ethilon sutures. Opening of the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. The V. thyroidea media and a further outlet for the venous anastomosis are then prepared and conditioned, as are the V. cephalica and an outlet of the confluence. After conditioning, the confluence is anastomosed to the small outlet from the V. thyroidea media using a 1.5 mm coupler. After opening the clamps, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The larger outlet from the V. thyroidea media is then anastomosed with the V. cephalica using a 2.5 mm coupler. Again, good venous return after opening the vein. Positive smear phenomenon.

In the synopsis of the findings cT3 cN2c G3 cM0. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was indicated.","After intubation and preparation by the anesthesia colleagues, first inspection and palpation of the primary tumor area. An exulcerated tumor of the left base of the tongue was found, extending into the vallecula and occupying a good half of the base of the tongue, in contact with the epiglottis, extending over the lateral pharyngeal wall in the area of the caudal pole of the tonsil up to the entrance of the piriform sinus. Palpatory clear deep infiltration in the area of the base of the tongue. Due to the deep location of the tumor, indication for a primary transcervical approach. PEG insertion should be performed first. For this purpose, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-scanning into the stomach and, with good diaphanoscopy, easy puncture of the stomach and subsequent placement of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. After positioning the patient, start with the neck dissection on the left side. Submandibular skin incision here. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue as well as the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery, the hypoglossal nerve and the facial vein. Level II shows a metastasis measuring approx. 3 cm in the area of the jugulo-facial angle, no surrounding infiltration, the accessorius nerve can be preserved. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Subsequent resection of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the external carotid arteries and long exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Release of the pharyngeal side wall against the carotid artery. Subsequent exposure of the hyoid. Entering the pharynx just below the epiglottis. Palpation reveals that the tumor is barely displaceable on the lingual surface of the epiglottis. Therefore resection of the cranial end of the epiglottis by approx. 2/3 of the width. Subtotal resection of the vallecula basally on all sides clearly in the healthy area. Subsequent resection of half of the base of the tongue. A clear safety margin is also maintained here. Resection of the pharyngeal side wall and thus macroscopic in sano removal of the tumor. Macroscopically narrowest point in the area of the pharyngeal side wall, otherwise extensive resection and clear resection distance to the depth on all sides. In the area of the pharyngeal side wall, a marginal specimen is therefore completely imaged in the pharyngeal area. The remaining marginal samples are then removed from the specimen, completely covering it. CIS with a questionable microinvasive component can still be seen in the area of the pharyngeal side wall in otherwise completely tumor- and dysplasia-free marginal samples. Therefore, a resection is performed in the entire area followed by imaging of a marginal sample, which is diagnosed as completely free of dysplasia and tumor. Therefore an overall R0 situation. Measurement of the defect. A defect measuring a total of 12 x 7 cm was found, which extended from the soft palate to the entrance of the piriform sinus, with removal of the vallecula and half of the base of the tongue. The rest of the tongue is regular and well supplied with blood. Turn to the neck dissection of the right side. In principle the same procedure as on the opposite side. Submandibular incision. After cutting through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, expose the bordering muscles. Clear the anterior neck preparation while carefully protecting the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery and the facial vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Clearing of the accessorius triangle while carefully protecting the nerve. Subsequent evacuation of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. This also revealed a clearly suspicious change measuring a good 2.5 cm in the jugulo-facial angle, confirming the overall cN2c neck status. On the opposite side, a metastasis-specific lesion was also removed in toto in the soft tissue on the way to tumor resection. This is followed by careful wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. The plastic tracheostomy is then performed. Horizontal incision below the cricoid cartilage. Cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. After cutting through the thyroid isthmus, enter between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring. Perform a visor tracheotomy and suture the trachea to the skin level. Subsequently, easy transfer to a size 8 low-cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. The radialis graft is then removed from the left forearm. After applying the tourniquet, mark the graft measuring 12 x 7.5 cm in total. Radial exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure and protection of the superficial radial nerve ramus. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle and transection of the vascular pedicle. Ulnar dissection of the flexor carpi ulnaris. Strictly subfascial release. Making the extension incision. The cephalic vein lies far dorsally and is therefore not elevated. Stalk preparation in the crook of the elbow. Expose and secure the outlet of the ulnar artery and the common interosseous artery. Exposure of a venous confluence. Subsequent reopening of the tourniquet. Vital graft. Regular blood supply to the hand. Careful hemostasis of the graft and the forearm and removal of the vital graft after ligation and clipping of the supplying vessels. The wound is then closed in two layers in the arm area and the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the groin is then incorporated. This is followed by treatment with a vacuum sealing bandage and application of the Kramer splint in the functional position and repositioning of the arm. To lift the full-thickness skin from the groin on the right. Incision of a piece of skin measuring approx. 14 x 6.5 cm. Strictly cutaneous lifting. Subcutaneous mobilization. Careful hemostasis. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure under moderate tension. Subsequent transcervical insertion of the graft. Overall good fit and intact conditions on all sides. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery. Perform the arterial anastomosis with 8-0 Ethilon. Immediate correct pedicle position and venous return. Measure a coupler size 3.0 and perform the venous anastomosis with the facial vein using the coupler system. Subsequently, proper graft perfusion and proper pedicle position with positive spreading phenomenon. This is followed by careful wound irrigation, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. Final inspection and completion of the procedure with a vital graft.","Transorale Tumorresektion mit partieller Pharyngektomie, Neck dissection, Freier Lappen (Radialis)

There is therefore an indication for further clarification and, if necessary, tumor removal.","After an introductory consultation with the anesthesiology colleagues, the glottic plane is first adjusted by laryngoscopy. Then, using 0 degree optics, visualization up to the glottic plane. This reveals an uneven mucosal change on the left side and a smooth mucosal protrusion on the right anterior side. The subglottic slope and the trachea are completely free of irritation and unremarkable. The patient is then intubated somewhat laboriously by the surgeon. The patient is then repositioned for esophagoscopy. The mucosa is found to be free of irritation when the flexible instrument is inserted into the esophagus. The patient is then viewed through to the stomach, where a regular mucosal relief can also be seen. After aspiration of the insufflated air, careful inspection of the esophagus during reflection. Here too, the mucosal conditions are normal. The patient is then repositioned for inspection of the oral cavity and oropharynx. Here too, the conditions are normal and unremarkable. Remove the Kleinsasser tube. Then, the hypopharynx is examined, where the mucosal conditions are also normal and without irritation. Then add the support autoscopy and the surgical microscope. Difficult adjustment of the glottic plane. The findings described above can be seen here. A deep sample is now taken from the area of the anterior third of the vocal fold on the right side under intact mucosa, which is carefully split with scissors. This is sent for frozen section diagnostics. After the diagnosis of an invasive carcinoma is made, the intraoperative endoscopic site is inspected again. This shows that the tumor is moving far forward into the anterior commissure. With difficult positioning of the patient, reliable tumor control from the endolaryngeal side is not possible. The decision is therefore made to operate on the larynx from the outside. After removing all instruments, the patient is repositioned for partial laryngeal resection from the outside. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline. Then Z-shaped incision prelaryngeal. Layered preparation in depth. Separation of the prelaryngeal muscles. The muscles are then pushed away from the anterior surface of the larynx. Slitting of the perichondrium. Then opening of the thyroid cartilage with the wheel. Horizontal opening of the ligamentum conicum and opening of the larynx. This shows that the tumor is significantly larger than initially expected from the endolaryngeal side. The tumor is then detached from the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage together with the perichondrium. Further dissection in the dorsal direction. The tumor almost reaches the vocal process. The tumor is deposited here near the vocal process. ................................ Parts of the subglottic slope are also resected. The resection extends cranially into the entrance of the pyriform sinus. The pouch ligament is unaffected by the tumor and remains completely intact. In the area of the anterior commissure, however, the tumor slightly crosses the midline, so that the resection must also extend to the opposite side here. Then take frozen section samples from all marginal areas of the resection. These are sent for frozen section diagnostics. However, it should be noted that the cranial and dorsal margins of the right side as well as the lower center are not in sano. Therefore, another clear resection in the area of the upper dorsal margin. The pocket ligament remains intact. Resection of the entire ligamentum conicum, the entire horizontal on the cricoid cartilage and at the attachment to the thyroid cartilage. These resected areas are sent for final histological diagnosis. Then marginal samples are taken again for rapid diagnosis from the area of the caudal margin of the thyroid cartilage on the outside and endolaryngeally at the transition to the trachea. These are still found to be tumor-free intraoperatively. The edge specimen of the dorsal cranial margin was also found to be tumor-free in the frozen section, so that an R0 resection can now be assumed. Careful hemostasis is therefore performed. Subsequently, a burr hole is made in the area of the thyroid cartilage and the ligament is tightened anteriorly in order to possibly ensure better voice regulation. In addition, two further drill holes are made in the area of the thyroid cartilage at the top and bottom on both sides. A laryngeal wedge is then sutured into place using these drill holes. The prelaryngeal muscles are then mobilized and sutured in front of the larynx. A slightly gaping space remains due to the missing ligamentum conicum between the cricoid cartilage and thyroid cartilage. This is also closed prelaryngeally with mobilized muscles. A large wound flap is inserted here, which is then drained to the outside. A second layer of prelaryngeal muscle is sutured again. Subcutaneous suture and skin suture and application of a pressure bandage. Before closing the larynx, a marginal sample was taken from the pocket ligament on the left side. If a carcinoma in situ is also found here, these findings should be discussed in detail in the tumor conference with regard to adjuvant therapy. A follow-up MLE should be planned for the patient in 6 weeks. If necessary, Keel removal can then also be performed. Final consultation with the anesthesia colleagues.","Kehlkopfteilresektion v. außen

The entire dissection was considerably more difficult due to scarring, in particular the veins and also the larger vessels were distorted cranially superior to the pharyngeal wall in the sense of severe scarring. Difficult removal of the scars. A facial vein with 2 outlets and a further outlet from the internal jugular vein can be dissected from the scar tissue. Subsequently, combined transoral, transcervical tumor resection: All large vessels and nerves are ligated using Wessel loops and pulled to the side. The tumor is then resected under internal and external control. Incision of the macroscopically visible tumor at a distance of 1.5 cm on all sides. The area of the posterior palatal arch, the entire tonsil lobe, the mucosa up to the alveolar ridge, parts of the base of the tongue, the lateral wall of the oropharynx and approx. 2 thirds of the posterior wall of the oropharynx are resected. Resection up to the border of the nasopharynx. The specimen is sent to the frozen section marked with a thread. Also marginal samples from basal, which includes hyoid bone and adjacent soft tissue. Marginal specimen from the vallecula to the caudal base of the tongue and marginal specimen from the posterior palatal arch to the upper posterior wall of the oropharynx adjacent to the nasopharynx. Marginal samples are thread-marked for frozen section. The frozen section still shows infiltrates in the area of the cranial margin of the posterior palatal arch and the cranial oropharyngeal wall. Here, another resection over several millimeters and another removal of a marginal sample, which extends from the border area at the alveolar ridge over the posterior palatal arch remnant to the posterior oropharyngeal wall. This is again sent to the frozen section. Carcinoma in situ infiltrates in the medial cranial area, i.e. in the oropharyngeal area extending to the nasopharynx. Therefore, another resection and subsequent removal of a marginal sample from the cranial oropharyngeal area or now already the nasopharyngeal mucosa area. No more higher-grade dysplasia or carcinoma infiltrates here. Thus a surgical R0 situation, although field carcinomatization cannot be completely ruled out. Typical skin incision and neck dissection on the left: This is performed in the same way as on the right side. Evacuation of levels II to V and preservation of the structures and branches of the cervical plexus. Ligation in the area of the inferior lymphatic vessels. Subsequent careful irrigation and hemostasis of all surgical areas. Measurement of the defect and the three-dimensional configuration. Defect length approx. 11 cm and width 8 to 9 cm. Recording on the forearm according to the orientation. Subsequent elevation of the forearm flap: First, recutting of the ulnar and superfascial preparation. Then extend cranially to the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the superficial venous system and the connection to the deep venous system. Subsequent radial incision. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. As far as possible. Caudal exposure of the radial artery. After clamping and sufficient time with adequate saturation of the forearm, cut through. The artery is ligated with 4-0 Prolene stitches. Lift the flap along its deep pedicle, including the superficial pedicle. Outgoing vessels are clipped or bipolar coagulated. Two branches of the cephalic vein and a confluence can be visualized in the antecubital fossa. The interosseous artery is cut and clipped after clamping and good saturation. The cephalic vein, the confluence and the radial artery are then removed. The artery is closed with stitching sutures after removal. The veins are ligated. Irrigation of the flap. The flap is then inserted into the defect. Successive suturing using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. Tension-free closure is achieved, even with reconstruction of the posterior palatal arch. Difficult suturing cranially in the area of the nasopharynx. Subsequent vascular anastomoses. Conditioning of the radial artery and the superior thyroid artery. The superior thyroid artery must be incised slightly, followed by anastomosis with 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. One of the cephalic veins is anastomosed with an outlet from the prepared facial vein after appropriate conditioning with a 3-0 coupler. Here, too, good venous return after opening the clamps, positive smear phenomenon. The other outlet from the facial vein is anastomosed with the 2nd outlet of the cephalic vein. Here, too, the smear phenomenon is positive after opening the clamps, good venous flow after opening the clamps. The confluence is clipped. Subsequent preparation and fixation of the pedicle in a favorable position. Irrigation of the surgical site. Hemostasis. Wound closure in layers on the right and insertion of 2 flaps on the left with insertion of a Redon drain. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma is completed. Insertion of an 8 mm tracheostomy tube, which is fixed with sutures. Thoracic inspection shows flap well perfused. The forearm is primarily closed cranially, the defect is closed caudally using split skin taken laterally from the right thigh with a thickness of 0.8 mm. Here, after taking swabs and relief incisions, Mepilex is taken and loose compresses are applied and fixed with absorbent cotton. A Kramer splint is then fitted and secured with an elastic bandage. Positioning of the arm. Saturation of the hand is always above 95 to 100 %. Starch is applied to the thigh area and then Mepilex. The procedure is completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit ventilated. Please continue antibiotics, which were started intraoperatively with Unacid, for approx. 1 week. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube, which should be loosened after 24 hours, for approx. 10 days, followed by gruel swallowing and, if necessary, diet build-up. Check blood flow to the flap clinically or by Doppler. Overall cT4a oropharyngeal carcinoma recurrence. Please wait for lymph node status and then presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Resektion (TORS), Neck diss.,

After intubation through the anesthesia, pharyngoscopy and confirmation of an oropharyngeal carcinoma measuring at least cT2 on the left side, which just reaches the posterior wall of the oropharynx and extends caudally and medially into the base of the tongue. On palpation, the tumor is slightly larger in comparison with the computer tomography and is difficult to move laterally. Initially under strict diaphanoscopic control and after administration of 3 g Unacid, after skin disinfection and abjodation, placement of a 15 Charričre PEG tube using the thread pull-through technique. Strict diaphanoscopic conditions on all sides. The gastric mucosa is unremarkable. Sterile dressing. Then insertion of the tonsil plug. Inspection of the tumor tissue again. Then, using the electric needle of the bipolar forceps under visualization, start resection of the tumour from cranial to caudal, taking parts of the base of the tongue with it. The tumor is not visible at any time and is released at a wide macroscopic distance. However, it becomes apparent that the tumor has grown laterally into the pterygoid musculature and the palpatory distance of the lateral tumor border lies in depth up to the immediate vicinity of the carotid flow area. It was therefore decided to continue the tumor resection transcervically; 2 cranial margin samples were tumor-free. Skin disinfection and infiltration anesthesia with a total of 18 ml Ultracaine with added adrenaline on both cervical and median sides. Start with neck dissection on the left side: skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Dissection of a subplatysmal portion of connective tissue. Release of the connective tissue sheath ventrally. Identification of the internal jugular vein, the omohyoid muscle and the digastric muscle. Remove the entire soft tissue mantle from the medial neck preparation, identify the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Now release from caudal to cranial. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, the vagus nerve and the cervical nerve. Level III and II show large, conglomerate-like lymph node metastases through which the accessorius nerve runs. It was therefore decided to resect the nerve. The internal jugular vein, which also runs through the metastasis, is then removed together with the metastatic conglomerate. The external jugular vein is preserved. After releasing and removing the submandibular gland, access is gained through level I b into the oropharynx. The en bloc resection of the tumor is now completed. Basally in the wound area to the lateral side, the pathology still describes an R1 situation, which is why selective resection is performed again at this point; the other marginal samples were tumor-free. Dissection of the external and internal carotid artery. Ligation of the left lingual artery. Identification of the vascular nerve bundle of the superior pharyngeal artery. Subtle hemostasis and neck dissection on the right side: Here too, 2 to 3 oval lymph nodes are visible in levels II and III, but overall they are also to be classified as suspicious. Neck dissection levels I b, II, III and IV and partial V are now performed. The submandibular gland is preserved, as are the external jugular vein, vagus nerve, cervical nerve, accessorius and hypoglossus. The internal jugular vein is also preserved on this side; the submandibular gland, removal of 2 inconspicuous lymph nodes from level I b. After a door-like incision, cut the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue to create a plastic tracheotomy. Blunt separation of the infrahyoid musculature. Identification of the anterior tracheal surface after transection of the isthmus of the thyroid gland. Visualization of the anterior surface of the trachea caudally. Incision between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp area. Formation of a Björk flap. Re-intubation. After ethibond suture fixation at 6 points on a 9 mm Rügheimer cannula and problem-free ventilation. Suture fixation of the cannula edges with an Ethibond suture. Then removal of an area of inguinal skin measuring 12 x 6 cm and placement of a Redon drain. At the same time, the radial flap on the left side of the forearm is removed. After placing the tourniquet, the oropharyngeal defect region is marked. This is now adapted to the forearm. Skin incision, cut in an S-shape, from the crook of the elbow into the flap area. Starting radially, detachment of the myofascial tissue portion, release of the flap with identification of the antebrachial cutaneous nerve and the parallel vein. Identification of the radial artery-venous bundle and consecutive release from distal to proximal with multiple clip ligation and bipolar coagulation of the draining and feeding branches. It is thus possible to develop a wide stalk which, however, consists of 2 small caliber veins. Removal of the tourniquet and further hemostasis and preparation of the left cervical vascular area. Removal of the pedicle and primary closure of the defect with the inguinally removed full-thickness skin and application of a VAC dressing. Please leave this in place for 7 days. Suture removal on the 7th day. Please take photo documentation, several times intraoperatively. Then also dissect the stalk of the arterio-venous vascular bundle. Now primary suture of the artery or connection to the superior thyroid artery using 8.0 Ethilon. After dissection, the external jugular vein is first recruited and supplied with a 2.0 mm coupler. The second vein is supplied with a 1.0 coupler from a venous vessel in the area of the superior or middle thyroid vein. Overall, this is very difficult to achieve, but a dense vascular anastomosis is created in both the arterial and venous areas. After placement of a Redon drain on both cervical sides, the wound is closed in two layers and a dressing is applied. Discrete signs of congestion enorally at the end of the operation but good perfusion. Cannula change on day 3 to 5; suture removal on the neck on day 7.

After exclusion of distant metastasis, indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the hypopharynx. An exophytic process measuring approx. 2-3 cm can be seen at the entrance to the piriform sinus on the medial and anterior side. The tip of the piriform sinus is free. This shows the exophytic mass measuring approx. 2-3 cm. It is located on the anterior and medial side wall of the piriform sinus. The tip is free. The lateral wall is also free. The process also extends into the postcricoid region. Adjustment of the process with the spread laryngoscope and activation of the laser and microscope. Start cutting around the tumor on the medial side wall and gradually remove it. Hemostasis is achieved using monopolar coagulation or vascular clips. To be on the safe side, another resection is performed on the medial wall, as the margin was relatively narrow after removal of the tumor in toto. Both are suture-marked for the frozen section. The frozen section still shows an invasive carcinoma in the mediocaudal area. A generous resection is performed here, including a margin sample, which is again sent to the frozen section. Final R0 situation. This results in a large wound area. Therefore decision to perform a tracheostomy. PEG placement using the thread pull-through method. Successful with good diaphanoscopy. Neck dissection on the right in the meantime. Externally a 5-6 cm metastasis breaking through the skin at level Va to b. Skin incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and in the area of the metastasis around the mass. Exposure of the platysma in the anterior upper area. Formation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This also shows that the metastasis under the skin also infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the cranial region. For this reason, the sternocleidomastoid is deposited in the caudal region at the base and the metastasis is deposited from caudal to cranial, sparing the cervical vascular sheath. The metastasis also infiltrates the cervical plexus, which must be completely removed except for a few small branches. The vagus nerve remains intact as it can be pushed away by the tumor. The border cord cannot be completely spared from the tumor. The accessory nerve is also removed. Ultimately, the hypoglossus remains at the top. During dissection, the subclavian vein is torn in the caudal area. This resulted in severe bleeding, which could be sutured over. The result is an hourglass-shaped structure that leads to narrowing of the vein but is still pervious. During the treatment of the subclavian hemorrhage, the outlet of the internal jugular vein was also torn, which ultimately had to be removed. However, deeper accompanying veins could be preserved. V. Bezas: Neck dissection on the left: Skin disinfection on the left and injection of 6 ml mixed solution of Ultracaine with 2% Suprarenin added in the area of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sterile washing and draping. Creation of a skin incision on the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection in depth and identification of the platysma. This is cut sharply. Now lift off a subplatysmal flap anteriorly and posteriorly. Further dissection in depth and identification of the superficial cervical fascia. Now identify the external jugular vein and auricular nerve. The great auricular nerve is completely spared and the external jugular vein is coagulated and cut. Now identify the sternocleidomastoid and dissect in depth along the muscles. First dissection in the level II b area until the digastric muscle is identified. Now dissect further along the digastric muscle until the accessor nerve is identified. Tissue above the accessorius nerve is sharply separated and the remaining tissue from level II b is pulled under the accessorius. Further dissection in the area of level II a up to the identification of the facial vein. Here a resection is performed below the submandibular gland. The marginal ramus nerve and facial nerve are not exposed during the preparation. Now clear Level II a until the hypoglossal nerve is identified. The hypoglossal nerve and internal carotid artery are exposed and spared. Now dissect further downwards along the sternocleidomastoid muscle to below the omohyoid muscle. Dissection further laterally up to the identification of the cervical plexus. Further dissection anteriorly above the cervical plexus and prevertebral cervical fascia. Sharp separation of the fatty tissue in level IV and dissection now along the common carotid artery. The fascia of the cervical vascular sheath is largely spared here. Now lift the preparation cranially and complete the dissection in level IV and level III above the internal jugular vein. Further dissection along the omohyoid muscle and infrahyoid muscles. The complete neck dissection is removed as one piece and sent for histological analysis. Careful hemostasis using ligatures and bipolar forceps. A size 10 Redon drain is placed and the wound is closed step by step once the bleeding has stopped completely. <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Lifting of the pectoralis major flap. Measurement of the defect. This results in a 5x7 cm defect that needs to be covered on the neck. The skin island medial to the nipple is configured accordingly. Creation of a skin bridge in the area of the theoretical delto-pectoral flap. Lifting of the skin island from the thoracic wall while protecting the pectoralis minor muscle. Locate and expose the vascular pedicle. Medial separation of the pectoralis major and lateral separation of the pectoralis major from the attachment to the humerus. Finally, most of the muscle is removed. The pedicle is palpable the entire time and the skin island is well supplied with blood. Pull the flap through the skin bridge and fit the graft so that a large muscle patch is positioned in the area of the pharynx. This muscle patch is fixed with sutures and the skin island can be inserted into the skin defect and sutured there. Two Redon drains were previously inserted in the chest area and one in the neck area. Two-layer wound closure in the neck and chest area. At the end, a tracheotomy was created using the visor technique. Insertion into the trachea between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage and creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis.

Due to the lack of adjustability and the localization in the area of the anterior commissure, an external approach was also discussed with the patient preoperatively. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the explained procedure preoperatively.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carrying out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Induction of anesthesia and intubation of the patient. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon. Insertion of the mouth guard. Insertion of the size D small bore tube. The tumor is now inspected with the aid of the support autoscope and the surgical microscope. Even after several attempts, the anterior commissure can only be visualized insufficiently. The decision is therefore made to access the tumor from the outside. Removal of the small bore tube. Positioning of the patient in head reclination. Skin spray disinfection and infiltration anesthesia. Skin wipe disinfection and sterile draping. First mark the thyroid incision. Marking of the planned incision using the broken-line technique. Sharp cutting of the cutis as well as the subcutis. Insert the retractors. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Locating the midline and lateralizing the musculature. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage and the ligamentum conicum. Incision of the perichondrium in the median line using the 15 mm scalpel. Creation of a horizontal incision in the area of the ligamentum conicum. Prepare two perichondrium flaps and also knock them aside. Opening of the larynx in the sense of a thyrofissure using the wheel. Insertion of the two-pronged retractor. A tumor is found in the area of the anterior and middle third of the left vocal fold. This reaches the anterior commissure. Incision of the tumor area with the 15 mm scalpel and removal of various marginal samples. During the intraoperative frozen section, tumor, i.e. carcinoma infiltrates, are still visible supraglottically on the left. In the cranial, caudal and supraglottic right margin samples, extensions of a carcinoma in situ are still visible. Therefore indication for resection and submission of new margin samples. These are now found to be tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. The extent of the resection therefore extended from the anterior commissure via the vocal ligament, vocal muscle and thyroarytaenoid muscle to just before the vocal process. Due to the extent of the tumor, the inner cortex of the thyroid cartilage is now cut with the diamond drill. Hemostasis by insertion of a suprarenin-soaked strip. This is followed by punctual hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Persistent dry wound bed at the end of the operation. Insertion of a 14-gauge wedge. Drilling of a total of four holes. Fixation of the wedge with Vicryl 3-0, followed by knocking back the neatly prepared perichondrium flaps and complete covering of the previously inserted wedge. In addition, readaptation of the previously mobilized prelaryngeal muscles. Prior to this, the wound is irrigated with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a sterile flap. Subcutaneous suture with Vicryl 4-0 and skin suture with Ethilon 5-0. Application of a wound dressing and a pressure bandage. Completion of the operation without complications. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist. Note: The patient should be scheduled for a control MLE, if necessary with removal of the cone, in approx. 6 weeks postoperatively.","KK-Teilresektion, MLE

Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery is now indicated. Patient also informed about the necessity of flap coverage due to the extent of the tumor.","First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The exulcerated tumor is seen in the area of the edge and body of the tongue on the right, the tip of the tongue is recessed, palpation extends into the base of the tongue, does not cross the midline and merges slightly into the floor of the mouth. Overall, indication for the above-mentioned operation with flap coverage confirmed. Initial PEG insertion: Pre-mirroring with the gastroesophagoscope and insertion of the PEG tube using the thread pull-through method after a clear positive diaphanoscopy. No complications. Subsequent transoral tumor resection: insertion of Spandex, followed by insertion of a retractor to open the mouth. Snaring of the tongue. Subsequent resection of the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm macroscopically to 2 cm macroscopically on all sides. The right half of the tongue is removed, leaving out the most anterior parts of the tip of the tongue. Resection is performed next to the left raphe. Resection encompasses the floor of the mouth up to the alveolar ridge, taking all soft tissue down to the bone. The lingual nerve cannot be spared here and is also resected, as are parts of the sublingual gland and submandibular gland. Resection extends to the base of the tongue. The resection extends from the alveolar ridge over the anterior palatal arch to the right tonsil, which is also taken along with the anterior palatal arch. The specimen is then removed in toto and marked with sutures. It goes to the frozen section examination. In addition, the submandibular gland with attached soft tissue is removed transcervically and an extensive resection or marginal sample is taken from the soft tissue basally at the transition to the neck on the right. In combination with the main tumor and marginal samples, this results in an R0 situation. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Measure the size of the flap, which is approx. 12 x 8 cm. Drawing in three-dimensional requirements on the left forearm. Neck dissection on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME>/<CLINICIAN_NAME>: Incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle between the mastoid and 2 transverse fingers above the clavicle using a 10 mm scalpel.

Marking of the flap borders (12 x 7 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0).

An exophytic tumor process with infiltration of the epiglottis can be seen starting at the free edge of the epiglottis on the right. The tumor continues across the aryepiglottic fold to just before the ary, a satellite focus is located slightly distant on the arytenoid mucosa, the main tumor mass is located in the right piriform sinus, which is subtotally filled, but the tip of the piriform sinus and the transition to the posterior wall of the hypopharynx are again tumor-free. Overall, there are clear perifocal extensions with a clearly uneven mucosa. Due to the extent, extensive cT2 with confirmed epiglottis infiltration cT3 tumor. Due to the size of the expected defect and the risk of pharyngo-cervical fistulization as well as the functional deficit due to the wound surface, the decision is made to proceed primarily transcervically with defect reconstruction. The patient is repositioned for this. First perform flexible esophagogastroscopy to insert the PEG tube. Enter with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. If the diaphanoscopy is good, the stomach can be punctured without any problems. Subsequent insertion of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline, starting with the right side. Cervical cutting of skin and subcutaneous tissue along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. The facial vein is exposed and ligated. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve and exact location of the superior laryngeal nerve, prolonged exposure and tracing and preservation of the nerve beyond the tumor resection. The internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery are now exposed. A metastasis-highly suspicious lesion can be dissected from the surrounding area, several suspicious lesions along the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Excision of the accessorius triangle and level V, carefully preserving the transverse cervical artery of the cervical plexus and the vagus nerve. In toto removal of the neck preparation with in sano resection of all metastasis-suspected lesions. The thyroid cartilage is now released on the right side with dissection of the piriform sinus and visualization of the hyoid. Enter at the level of the right-sided vallecula. Widening of the pharyngotomy. Successive resection with 2/3 resection of the epiglottis, resection of the right aryepiglottic fold, resection of the arytenoid mucosa, leaving the intact joint intact. Subtotal resection of the right piriform sinus, the tip can be preserved. Resection up to the border of the posterior wall. After removal of the tumor, the specimen shows a somewhat scarce area basally, corresponding to the pre-epiglottic fatty tissue. This tissue is therefore completely resected. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for definitive histology together with the resected specimen. The invasive carcinoma is resected on the specimen R0, also in the basal section, only in the area of the pharyngeal side wall up to the cranial side is there a long stretch of Cis, so that an extensive resection is now carried out here. Renewed coverage with a mucosal margin sample, which was found to be completely free of tumor and dysplasia in the frozen section diagnostics, so that an R0 resection can be assumed. Measuring the defect and initially turning to plastic tracheotomy. Now turn to plastic tracheotomy. In the case of a post-thyroidectomy, use the old skin incision approx. 1 cm below the cricoid cartilage, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Removal of scars, exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea, insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring, creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and successive insertion of the tracheostoma. Neck dissection of the left side is then performed in parallel with radialis graft removal. For neck dissection: skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue, dissection of the platysma, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle, submandibular gland, removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical artery, facial vein and superior thyroid artery. Free preparation of the cervical vascular sheath with exposure and protection of the vagus nerve, exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve, removal of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Overall, no suspicious nodules here, so that after final wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and dry wound conditions, a 10-gauge Redon drain was inserted with careful two-layer wound closure. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Removal of the forearm flap to cover the right hypopharyngeal defect. Mark the size of the defect, which is 6 x 8 cm. Then mark a skin monitor approx. 1 x 2 cm slightly proximal to the graft. Incision of the skin. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle with exposure of the cephalic vein. Removal of the graft subfascially from the ulnar side. Exposure of the superficial venous system and removal of this. Exposure of the superficial ramus and radial nerve. Locating the radial artery. Clamping and ligation of this. Further removal of the radial and subfascial flap. Further subfascial dissection and elevation of the radial artery flap along the pedicle. Smaller outgoing vessels are bipolarly coagulated and treated, larger ones are clipped.

After dissection, this can be pushed away from the metastatic block completely including the adventitia, partly bluntly, no signs of infiltration here. Caudally just above the mouth of the subclavian vein, separation of the internal jugular vein with overall extensive infiltration and obliteration, caudally good separation from the brachial plexus, no signs of infiltration here either, so that overall the complete metastatic block can be extirpated in toto and in sano. The vagus nerve was also preserved along the entire route. Residues of level Ia and level VI are extirpated, followed by visualization and release of the hyoid on the right side. Release of the thyroid cartilage in case of tumor growth, but certainly no tumor breakthrough. Covering of the soft tissues of the neck everywhere. However, the paralaryngeal muscles on the right side were left intact. Mobilization of the larynx only caudally. Detachment of the thyroid gland and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. Exposure and exposure of cricoid cartilage and trachea. On the left side now classic dissection and skeletonization of the larynx. Detachment of the paralaryngeal and infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the thyroid horn, sharp release of the piriform sinus. Now enter cranial to the hyoid due to the extent of the tumor on the left. Paramedian successive extension of the pharyngotomy via the left-sided vallecula, sparing and mucosa-sparing resection in the area of the aryepiglottic fold on the left up to the postcricoid while preserving and releasing the piriform sinus. On the right side, the tumor is incised in situ with a safety margin of approx. 1.5 cm, taking the pharyngeal musculature with it and thus also safely in sano in depth. Resection up to the postcricoid, here about half of the tumor is affected. Healthy conditions on all sides towards the esophageal entrance. Finally, removal of the specimen below the cricoid cartilage. Inspection of the tumor, practically no extension subglottically and wide in sano resection here, the tumor is resected in sano on all sides on the specimen, so that the marginal sample is taken on the specimen. Only in the area of the postcricoid region is there a somewhat narrower distance after removal of the tumor block, which is why complete imaging of the mucosa and margin samples is performed in situ. In the frozen section diagnostics, all marginal samples are free of tumor and dysplasia, so that an R0 situation can be assumed. The neck dissection of the left side is now performed. Here, metastasis at the transition from level II to Va behind the internal jugular vein. Macroscopic visualization of the omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Release of the submandibular gland, visualization of the omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Release of the submandibular gland, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, free preparation of the internal jugular vein while preserving the facial vein. Exposure and preservation of the accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve and cervical artery. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. The metastasis described above can be removed in sano without any signs of surrounding infiltration. Further borderline enlarged lymph nodes on the internal jugular vein are resected en bloc with the neck dissection which extends to level Va. Final palpation also on both sides in the nuchal and supraclavicular direction, no further abnormalities, so that after wound irrigation, the Provox voice prosthesis is initially placed here with a regular esophageal entrance, good mucosal conditions and a regular trachea. The trachea is adjusted by creating a dorsal elevation. Easy insertion of a size 8 Provox prosthesis at the most cranial point possible. Particularly in the area of the caudal pharyngeal tube and the esophageal entrance, the mucosa is wide, so that after a demonstration of the findings at <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> a primary suture of the mucosa is performed in several layers, especially including the base of the tongue in the case of a larger defect on the right side due to the extent of the tumor. Finally, wide conditions and an intact pharyngeal tube on all sides. Due to the skeletonized common carotid artery and the larger pharyngeal defect, the right thyroid lobe is now rotated to reline the pharyngeal suture. Release of the right thyroid lobe with removal of the inferior pole. The thyroid gland is now stitched onto the stalk of the superior thyroid artery and the accompanying veins, particularly on the cranial part of the pharyngeal suture. Good positioning. Subsequent final wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Careful two-layer wound closure and insertion of the tracheostoma. Subsequent problem-free reintubation to a size 10 low cuff cannula. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT4a cN2c cM0 G3 hypopharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Postoperatively, forced adjuvant therapy is certainly required due to the advanced metastasis. An X-ray pelvis was performed on the 10th postoperative day. If there are signs of a pharnygocutaneous fistula, please report this to the surgeon at an early stage.","Laryngektomie, Neck dissection sowie Tracheotomie

Endolarynx completely filled, carcinoma breaks through the thyroid cartilage or the laryngeal skeleton and also through the prelaryngeal skin. Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery is indicated.","This is followed by bronchoscopic intubation. Then laryngoscopy and pharyngoscopy again: this confirms the preoperative findings, no infiltration of the pharynx. Now inject a total of 15 ml Ultracaine 1 % with adrenaline. Skin disinfection and sterile draping. Then outline the infiltrated skin. A distance of 1 cm with resection of the skin island, which remains on the laryngeal skeleton. Outside the resection, a circular margin sample is taken, which contains skin and soft tissue. No tumor infiltrates here. Thus free in the area of the neck skin. The rest of the neck skin is then lifted in the form of a subplatysmal flap. Skin remains somewhat more fixed in the cranial area for blood circulation. Beginning with neck dissection on the right: exposing the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposing the omohyoid and digastric muscles. Cranially there are tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes in level II. The facial vein is dissected and ligated. The hypoglossal nerve is exposed and preserved. Cervical vascular sheath is exposed, internal jugular vein, internal and external carotid artery are preserved. Vagus nerve is visualized and preserved. N. accessorius is exposed and preserved. The lymph nodes are then removed from levels II to V, whereby the branches of the cervical plexus are preserved. The superior thyroid artery is exposed and preserved. Subsequent neck dissection on the left side: Level II to IV are removed in the same way as on the right side. The thoracic duct is exposed caudally but not opened. Subsequent laryngectomy: mobilization of the laryngeal skeleton on both sides in the same way. Mobilization of the thyroid gland caudo-laterally. Exposure of the hyoid bone and detachment from the suprahyoid muscles. Exposure of the superior cornu and detachment of the pharyngeal constrictor and dissection of the piriform sinus. Subsequent entry into the larynx at the level of the epiglottis. Successive development of the larynx from cranial to caudal. The trachea was previously opened caudally and partially epithelized. Re-intubation and insertion of a ventilation tube. The larynx is then developed and set down. The larynx is sent as a complete preparation for frozen section. The tumor margins are then all free in the frozen section. Pharyngeal tube easily passable at the entrance area, therefore no myotomy necessary. Insertion of an 8 mm Provox prosthesis without complications. The pharyngeal tube is then sutured. The mucosa is sutured inverted in a first layer. In a second layer, the first suture is inverted by another inverting suture. The pharyngeal tube is then sutured. This is followed by irrigation of the entire wound area with H202 and Ringer's solution. Subsequent inspection of the neck skin and measurement of the defect. Measure the length of the pedicle. Mark the pectoralis flap in the appropriate size and at the appropriate distance on the right chest wall. Create a subfascial skin bridge on the pectoralis major flap. Then develop the pectoralis major flap successively by placing ........... sutures. The vascular pedicle was previously identified under the pectoralis major. Successive development of the flap along its pedicle up to the clavicle. Insertion of the flap under the skin bridge into the neck skin defect. Then suture the pectoralis flap into the skin defect and simultaneously epithelialize the tracheostoma. Closure of the neck skin with insertion of a Redon drain after careful hemostasis and repeated irrigation in layers on both sides. Subsequent mobilization of the thoracic skin and, after careful haemostasis and irrigation, low tension closure of this after insertion of 2 Redon drains. Insertion of a 10 mm tracheostomy tube without any problems. The procedure was completed without complications. Overall cT4a laryngeal carcinoma with invasion of the prelaryngeal skin and soft tissue. R0 situation, neck dissection on both sides of the suspicious cranial lymph nodes in level II on both sides.

Then perform the tracheotomy through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Re-intubation of the patient. Now first transoral tumor resection. After appropriate adjustment with the tonsil retractor, the tumor is resected with the monopolar caustic. Part of the soft palate on the left side or the uvula is resected. Laterally, the resection reaches the mandibular branch. Dorsally and medially, the tumor is successively resected in healthy muscle tissue. The resection continues into the glossotonsillar groove, which appears inconspicuous macroscopically. After removal of the tumor, peripheral incisions are made circumferentially, all of which are found to be tumor-free on frozen section histology. The selective neck dissection is then performed on the left side. After making the apron flap incision and dissection upwards, fixation upwards in the usual manner. Then skeletonize the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A large metastasis is found here in region II, which can be successively removed in toto after skeletonization of the digastric muscle. After opening and skeletonizing the vascular nerve sheath, regions I-V are resected while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. The large caliber jugular vein and the superior thyroid artery are skeletonized, exposed and preserved and are later used for anastomosis of the microvascular radial lobe graft. Subsequent transition to the opposite side. Here, after the initial start by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the same procedure with similar findings. Here, too, there is a mass in region II, albeit a smaller one, which is suspected to be metastatic. The hypoglossal nerve is then exposed on the left side and cut upwards. Dissection of the digastric muscle and creation of the pharyngotomy at the caudal resection margin of the transoral resection. Widen the access while protecting the lingual artery, the external carotid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Lifting of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Drawing of a graft in consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who measured the defect 9 x 6 cm. Marking of the radial artery, the ulnar artery and the cephalic vein. Then unwrap the arm and apply a 300 mmHg tourniquet. Incision of the skin and exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the cephalic vein which can be integrated laterally into the graft. Then expose the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Preservation of this nerve branch with all its additional branches. Exposure of the radial artery. Separation of the radial artery, lifting of the graft from the tendon bed and preparation in the usual manner up to the elbow. The radialis graft is then removed, taking with it the cephalic vein from the superficial system and the venous confluence and lifting a venous outflow from the deep venous system. The graft is then flushed with heparin and handed over to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who then sutures it in place. The defect is then covered with split skin from the right thigh in the usual way and the arm is closed in the usual way. The radial lobe graft is then inserted through the pharyngotomy into the resection defect. Fixation of the radial flap graft in the resection area. Subsequently, the microvascular anastomosis of the artery from the radial artery to the superior thyroid artery and the large-volume brachial vein to the facial vein is performed. The flap shows excellent perfusion on all sides. Application of a Redon drainage on both sides. Two-layer wound closure. Completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis and transfer of the patient to an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube. Sterile wound dressing on both cervical sides. Transoral inspection of the flap from which bright red arterial blood runs out at the upper pole after puncture. End of the operation and transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: partial oropharyngeal resection for tonsillar carcinoma on the left side. R0 resection on frozen section histology intraoperatively as well as macroscopically. Selective neck dissection on both sides. Defect coverage with microvascularly anastomosed radial artery flap graft from the left forearm and defect coverage on the left forearm with split skin from the right thigh. Arterial anastomosis to the superior thyroid vein and venous anastomosis to the facial vein. Creation of a PEG and a mucocutaneous tracheostoma. Intraoperative metastatic mass certainly on the left and also on the right, therefore adjuvant therapy is recommended postoperatively.","Transorale Tumorresektion, funkt.

This reveals a spherical mass in the area of the base of the tongue, which is covered by smooth mucosa, with otherwise normal, inconspicuous mucosal conditions and a relatively narrow pharynx. Then reposition the patient and insert the Fentex retractor and expose the base of the tongue. Extremely difficult to adjust here. In the end, however, it was possible to expose the tumor completely. Then insertion of the robotic instruments. Start the resection tangentially at the base of the tongue so that the tumor can be excised circularly with a sufficient safety distance to the tumor. This is done using monopolar coagulation and subtle hemostasis. Several marginal samples are then taken and sent in as frozen sections for histopathological tissue examination. These are found to be tumor-free intraoperatively. Subtle hemostasis again. Then removal of the robotic instruments and the Fentex retractor. Due to significant swelling in the area of the entire hypopharynx, the decision was made to tracheostomy the patient after he could only be intubated bronchoscopically by the anesthesia colleagues. This measure is carried out as a protective intubation. The patient is then repositioned, the neck is abducted and local anesthetic with adrenaline is injected. Then pretracheal skin incision and layered preparation in depth. Dissection of the pretracheal muscles in the midline, which is then dissected to the side. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is undermined and dissected after careful coagulation. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Then incision of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp. Preparation of a Björk flap. Then circular suturing of the trachea in the sense of anastomosis to the skin. Then insertion of an 8-bore tracheostomy tube through which the patient can initially continue to be ventilated without any problems. The procedure is then completed. Repeated enoral bleeding control, here dry wound conditions. The decision was therefore made to end the procedure and allow the patient to wake up, which was done without any problems.

In addition, there is a 4 ˝ cm lymph node metastasis on the left with infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned operation.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthetist, 3 g of Unacid is administered preemptively. Flexible esophagogastroscopy is then performed under constant air insufflation. After positive diaphanoscopy, insertion of the trocar and placement of the PEG tube using the thread pull-through method in the typical manner. The tumor is now positioned with the spread laryngoscope. The left aryepiglottic fold is found to be about 1 cm wider, thickened and uneven without clearly exophytic tumor growth. Under the microscope, however, the clearly uneven mucosa is visible. The mass does not infiltrate the arytenoid cartilage and extends both endolaryngeally and towards the median piriform sinus wall over a width of approx. 5 mm. Cranially and anteriorly, it reaches the aryepiglottic fold without actually infiltrating the lateral side. Demonstration of the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who approves the procedure. Now the resection is started with the CO2 laser at 4 watts and continues mode, initially on the median side and at the border to the arytenoid cartilage. Then laterally over the base of the epiglottis into the pharyngoepiglottic fold. Laterally, the anterior piriform sinus wall is also resected in the entrance area of the piriform sinus and then the resection is completed along the median piriform sinus wall with a safety margin of approx. 5 mm. During the resection, a small arterial hemorrhage occurs once, which can be easily stopped using monopolar coagulation. After careful consideration of the tumor specimen, a decision is made to perform another small resection in the anterior and cranial area of the pharyngoepiglottic fold/laryngeal epiglottis junction. This is also done with the laser. Now, after consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, several marginal samples are taken: 1x medial to the aryepiglottic fold/transition pocket fold, 1x anterior cranial along the pharyngoepiglottic fold, the 3rd starting from the arytenoid cartilage over the median piriform sinus wall to the lateral and the 4th in the area of the wound bed. The frozen section diagnosis reveals mild to moderate dysplasia in the area of the median piriform sinus wall. A resection is therefore carried out in this area if the mucosa is normal and sent for frozen section diagnostics. A resection is also performed in the area of the median aryepiglottic fold/transition pocket fold if the mucosa is slightly suspicious under the microscope. The 2nd frozen section diagnosis now reveals non-irritant conditions in the area of the median piriform sinus wall, but a tiny carcinoma in situ in the area of the median aryepiglottic fold/pocket fold junction. Therefore, a second resection is performed here, which is sent for final histology and a second marginal sample of the aryepiglottic fold in the median direction. In between, neck dissection level I b to V b is performed on the left side, which involves partial resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and resection of the internal jugular vein and facial vein. Initial curved skin incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection through the platysma. Protect the external jugular vein. Now attempt to dissect the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. However, it quickly becomes apparent that this is cemented to the tumor conglomerate, but only in the central area. The anterior margin is therefore exposed in the caudal and cranial area and a partial resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is performed in the central area. The resection is then continued subglottismal to anterior, then the omohyoid muscle is followed posteriorly to anterior without the digastric venter muscle. The submandibular gland is skeletonized. In addition, the facial vein is identified and ligated. Then identify the hypoglossal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve and form the preparation from median to lateral. The thyroid gland and the deep laryngeal musculature are visualized in the caudal region. Now expose the internal jugular vein cranially and caudally of the tumor conglomerate. This is relatively small and without a lumen, so that a thrombosis of the vein must be suspected. It was therefore decided to resect and ligate the internal jugular vein in its cranial and caudal insertion. Now dissect along the common carotid artery from median to lateral. It can be seen that the tumor conglomerate can be easily pushed away from the carotid artery. In addition, identify the vagus nerve and spare the last one. Now laterally expose the scalene musculature. Identify the accessorius nerve, which can be spared, and complete the neck dissection in its lateral section from cranial to lateral while sparing the plexus branches and the accessorius nerve. In the deep caudal area, care is taken to resect level II b as well. Now careful hemostasis. Placement of a 10 Redon drain and two-layer wound closure using subcutaneous and skin sutures. After consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, a temporary plastic tracheotomy is performed: horizontal incision approx. 1 cm caudal to the cricoid cartilage. Dissection through subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure of pretracheal musculature. Spreading in the linea alba. Identification of the thyroid isthmus and undermining. Bipolization of the thyroid isthmus and spreading of the trachea. Opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring and epithelialization of the slit-shaped opening in the sense of a visor tracheotomy. Re-intubation with an 8 mm Rügheimer cannula. Now proceed to neck dissection of the right side selectively level II to IV. Dissection through subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Identification and protection of the accessorius nerve. Dissect the internal jugular vein from caudal to cranial and expose the facial vein and, after isolating the cervical vascular sheath, form the lateral neck preparation from cranial to caudal while sparing the plexus branches and the accessory nerve. This is followed by resection above the venous angle after identification of the hypoglossal nerve and finally removal of the median neck preparation caudal to the facial vein. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation. Irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer. Placement of a 10 Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. The final frozen section diagnosis now results in an R0 resection, meaning completion of the procedure without bleeding and without complications. Conclusion: cT1 cN2b supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma of the left side, which was laser resected R0. Intraoperative administration of Unacid, which should be continued for 3 days. The patient should not be given any oral food for 1 week and then the cannula could be removed after a swallowing attempt.  ","Laserresektion, Neck diss., PEG-Anlage

Computed tomography showed no evidence of distant metastasis. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, the primary surgical procedure was decided.","First, after preparation by the anesthesia colleagues, the primary tumor region is inspected. An ulcerated tumor is found in the area of the soft palate with a depleted uvula. Infiltration of the right tonsil. Here infiltration beyond the tonsil capsule, laterally. The caudal tonsil pole is exceeded by palpation. In addition, clear infiltration on the right side of the posterior palatal arch up to the transition to the posterior pharyngeal wall. On the left side, the carcinoma moves to the left tonsil, does not infiltrate it palpatorily via the hianus capsule, but here too there is clear infiltration of the posterior palatal arch, also with transition to the posterior pharyngeal wall. The transoral procedure is now performed. Incision in the area of the mucosal level of the tumor with subtotal removal of the soft palate. Complete removal of the anterior left palatal arch in the sense of a tumor tonsillectomy. Release of the tonsil at the lower tonsil pole. No transgression of the tonsil capsule laterally, safe basal conditions here. Inclusion of the posterior palatal arch. Resection up to the posterior pharyngeal wall is necessary. Right-sided extended resection. Resection up to the parapharyngeal soft tissue of the neck. This ensures safe conditions basally. Resection caudally up to the entrance of the piriform sinus. Resection of the posterior palatal arch also up to the posterior wall of the oropharynx so that only a mucosal strip of approx. 3 to 4 mm remains in the area of the posterior wall of the oropharynx. Retraction of the soft palate. It can now be seen that the tumor is clearly infiltrating cranially via the posterior surface of the posterior palatal arch. Therefore extension of the resection. Resection down to the hard palate. Cut off the posterior edge of the maxilla down to the choanae and the posterior edge of the septum. For reasons of overview, the main tumor is removed first and isolated to the cranial part. Form a post-resection by removing the posterior edge of the maxilla as described above. Resection up to the tubal bulges. The ostia remain intact. Complete covering here in the nasopharyngeal region in the area of the mucosal settling margins. Otherwise, take marginal samples from the specimen. The specimen is thread-marked for definitive histology. Marking of the separated tumor portion, otherwise macroscopic in sano resection on the specimen. Complete covering of the tumor with margin samples as far as possible. In this case, frozen section diagnostics show an in sano resection for the invasive carcinoma. Only in the area of the margin in the area of the left lateral tonsillar lobe is there a CIS and in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall a suspicion of CIS as well as moderate dysplasia. A resection was performed in the area lateral to the left tonsil and covered with a new marginal specimen, which was found to be tumor-free. Due to the circumscribed pharyngeal remnant and the proximity of the tumor, the decision was made to completely resect the posterior pharyngeal wall and preserve the prevertebral fascia. After confirmation of the N0 situation, the neck is first dissected on the right side. To do this, make an incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digatric muscle. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein, internal jugular vein, facial vein, superior thyroid artery, cervical artery, hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the common carotid artery and vagus nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and completion of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Macroscopically conspicuous nodes in level II, otherwise macroscopically inconspicuous site. If the wound is dry, the tracheotomy is then performed. The skin incision is made horizontally below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Due to the height of the larynx, insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring. Formation of a visor tracheotomy and incision of the skin in the typical manner. Subsequent intubation onto a tube. At the end of the procedure, reintubation onto a size 8 low-cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. The anterolateral thigh graft is now lifted from the right after doppler sonographic identification of the main perforator and a secondary perforator. The graft, measuring 17 x 8 cm in total, is marked. Medial incision. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Cutting through the fascia lata. Exposing and securing the rectus femoris muscle. Subfascial dissection. Identification of the pedicle vessel. Subsequent identification of the main perforator. Dissection of the perforator down to the pedicle vessel with musculocutaneous perforator course. In the area of the perforator junction, leave the fascia lata on the graft, otherwise leave in situ. Complete resection and release. Isolation on the perforator and the pedicle vessel. Subsequent removal of the excellent vital graft after supplying the feeding and draining vessels. Careful monitoring of the thigh area and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful multi-layer wound closure with adaptation of the skin edges. The combined transcervical and transoral insertion of the graft is now performed. The conditions here are considerably more difficult due to the extensive defect. Finally, however, good reconstruction. In the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, the graft is sutured to the prevertebral fascia and a narrow exposed margin is left here. Good reconstruction of the soft palate and the nasopharyngeal section. Intact conditions on all sides. Stalk positioning to the right cervical side, after previous creation of a tunnel measuring approximately 3 transverse fingers. The superior thyroid artery is then dissected and conditioned. Perform the arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. This works well. Immediate venous return via both draining veins. First condition the facial vein. Perform the anastomosis with the coupler system. If there is still clear venous return via the second vein, the second vein is anastomosed to the external jugular vein, also using the Coupler system. Subsequently, a regular pedicle position and a positive spreading phenomenon and vital graft enorally, so that a 10 Redon drain is then inserted and the wound is carefully closed in two layers. Neck dissection on the left side. The skin incision here corresponds to the opposite side. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle. Release of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, facial vein, superior thyroid artery, cervical artery, hypoglossal nerve. Exposure and clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, vagus nerve and common carotid nerve and evacuation of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. If the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Subsequent careful two-layer wound closure and completion of the procedure with a vital graft and no indication of complications. Conclusion: Extensive growing cT3 cN2c oropharyngeal carcinoma on both sides with discrete right emphasis. Due to the extensive defect, initial feeding via the existing PEG tube for at least 8 to 9 days. If the graft heals properly, a gradual increase in nutrition can then take place; if necessary, a prolonged recovery of swallowing function can be expected due to the extent of the defect. Presentation at our interdisciplinary tumor conference to determine the extent of adjuvant therapy.","Resektion, Neck diss., Defektdeckung, Freier Lappen (ALT), Tracheotomie

In the area of the right oropharyngeal side wall with spread to the base of the tongue and tumor infiltration up to the anterior palatal arch. The B-image sonographic examination shows a lymph node metastasis in region II on the right side with relatively close contact to the tumor. Based on the findings, the indication for enoral tumor resection and bilateral neck dissection was concluded. The patient was informed preoperatively and had sufficient time to ask questions.","Transfer of the patient to the central OR (room 13). Introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleagues and induction of intubation anesthesia by the colleagues. Intubation with an 8 mm Woodbridge tube. Start of the operation using flexible gastroesophagoscopy by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Careful advancement into the stomach and air insufflation. Attempt to perform a diaphanoscopy, which is unsuccessful. Now aspiration of air and careful reflection back through the esophagus during air insufflation. Conclusion: Due to the negative diaphanoscopy, a PEG is dispensed with. The tumor is now positioned with the Kleinsasser tube size C. An ulcerative mass is seen in the area of the right oropharyngeal side wall, which merges into the right-sided base of the tongue. This mass extends cranially to the anterior palatal arch. The other mucosal areas are not suspicious. Now insertion of the Tors mouth retractor. Exposure of the tumor and docking of the robotic arms in the usual manner. The 0° optics are used. Now start the tumor incision after consulting the resection margins with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The tumor is removed at the cranial margin with sufficient safety distance (over 1 cm) in the area of the anterior palatal arch. Careful medialization of the tumour specimen and dissection using electrocoagulation in the parapharyngeal musculature. Constant attention is paid to maintaining a sufficient safety distance from the tumor. The parapharyngeal fat is visible laterally. Now also resection in the area of the base of the tongue with sufficient safety distance. The tumor resectate can now also be detached from the posterior wall of the oropharynx. Suture marking of the specimen and sending in for frozen section diagnostics as well as generous resection in the area of the anterior palatal arch from the parauvular to the alveolar ridge. Both specimens are thread- and needle-marked on a cork plate for histologic frozen section examination. After consultation with the pathologist, the main specimen showed an R0 resection in the cranial direction (parauvularly only just in the healthy area), and the resected specimen showed no further tumor cells. Conclusion: An R0 situation can now definitely be assumed with a wide safety margin on all sides. Subtle hemostasis is performed using bipolar coagulation forceps. As there is no major bleeding, a protective tracheostomy is not performed. The operation was completed without complications. Summary: Enoral robot-assisted tumor resection of a T2 N1 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right side with R0 resection confirmed by frozen section diagnostics. Due to a negative diaphanoscopy, a PEG had to be omitted.","Tonsillektomie (TORS)

Laryngoscopy was first performed using a Kleinsasser C-tube. This revealed a tumor that completely obstructed the entire laryngeal lumen from the median area of the aryepiglottic folds on both sides to the subglottic region. In addition, one has the impression that the tracheostoma has been inserted close to the tumor. Skin spray disinfection, application of local anesthesia cervically on both sides and around the existing tracheostoma. Skin ablation and sterile draping. Creation of a skin incision, transection of the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma and formation of a subplatysmal apron flap up to the level of the hyoid bone, which is then fixed in place using bridle sutures. The anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is then exposed on the right side. Exposure of the anterior jugular vein and the right external jugular vein, which are ligated and cut. Dissection along the sternocleidomastoid muscle in depth. The branches of the cervical plexus are exposed in depth and spared. Now also expose the omohyoid muscle and dissect along the muscle to the hyoid bone. Identification of the N. accessorius and free preparation of the nerve from the neck preparation. At the junction with the internal jugular vein, the digaster venter posterior muscle is exposed and completely freed from the neck preparation. Expose the submandibular gland and dissect the digastric muscle up to the hyoid bone. Now focus on the internal jugular vein just above the omohyoid muscle. Dissection shows that 2 lymph node metastases measuring approx. 1 cm are firmly attached to the vein wall. On closer examination, the high-grade evidence of infiltration of the vascular wall is revealed. In consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, it was decided to include the internal jugular vein in the neck preparation. For this purpose, expose the vein cranially just below the digastric muscle and caudally just cranial to the omohyoid muscle. Expose the common carotid artery, the carotid bifurcation and the vagus nerve along the entire course of the dissected vein. Now first remove the vein caudally and place 2 vascular ligatures on the vascular stump. The same procedure is also carried out cranially, sparing the hypoglossal nerve and the accessory nerve. Both nerves can be exposed and spared. The entire neck preparation is then removed from cranial to caudal, including the vein and constant bleeding control using bipolar coagulation forceps. The preparation is carried out with constant consideration of the nerves of the cervical plexus and the phrenic nerve on the scalene muscle. Removal of the neck preparation without complications. Hemostasis dorlt by means of bipolar coagulation and subsequent repositioning of the patient on the left side to perform the neck dissection. Dissection along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, digaster muscle and omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Successive evacuation of the posterior and anterior neck preparation while sparing the above-mentioned structures and the plexus branches. In region IV, several suspicious masses were found on the left side, which were then removed with the specimen. Hemostasis there by means of bipolar coagulation. Subsequently, the skin of the already existing tracheostoma was cut circularly. Additional removal of the prelaryngeal fatty tissue subplatysmal. Both samples are sent for intraoperative frozen section examination, which results in the diagnosis of cancer-free findings in both cases. Due to the infiltration of the laryngeal skeleton at the level of the thyroid cartilage as demonstrated by computed tomography, it is decided to resect the prelaryngeal musculature in the laryngeal specimen. This is then cut caudally at the level of the cricoid cartilage and cranially at the level of the hyoid bone and removed in the laryngeal preparation. The hyoid bone is then skeletonized and the thyroid cartilage is skeletonized at its posterior edge on both sides. Care is taken to ensure that the prelaryngeal musculature with the thyroid cartilage is also removed in the preparation. Subperichondral dissection on the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage on both sides and maximum protection of the piriform sinus on its outer side. Subsequent exposure of the free epiglottis margin and median pharyngotomy. Dissection along the lateral edges of the epiglottis and the aryepiglottic folds on both sides. Maximum protection of the pharyngeal mucosa in the area of the piriform sinus from cranial to caudal on both sides. Transverse mucosal incision in the postcricoid area, joining the lateral incisions with this transverse incision and entering the region between the posterior wall of the trachea and the anterior wall of the esophagus. Dissection caudally in this layer. Repeated hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Dissection of the thyroid gland from the side wall of the trachea on both sides. Dissection revealed that the tracheostoma had been inserted between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage clasp and thus clearly in the area of subglottic tumor spread. Decision to remove the former tracheostoma in the tumor preparation. Exposure of the anterior tracheal wall caudal to the existing tracheostoma and incision between the 3rd and 4th tracheal cartilage clasp. Partial epithelialization of the new tracheostoma at its lower edge. Removal of the laryngeal preparation in toto, which is sent in thread-marked for intraoperative frozen section examination. In addition, the following edge samples are sent for intraoperative examination: Tracheostoma anterior margin, lateral tracheal wall left, lateral tracheal wall right, postcricoid mucosa, base of tongue midline, lateral pharyngeal wall right, lateral pharyngeal wall left. In the last 2 marginal samples and more precisely in their cranial part, CIS parts are then detected during the intraoperative frozen section examination. Thus, generous resection in this region and removal of 2 further marginal samples from the right and left cranial pharyngeal side wall, which were found to be tumor-free by the pathology colleagues in the intraoperative frozen section examination. Hemostasis there by means of bipolar coagulation. Cricopharyngeal myotomy in the typical manner. Subsequent 3-layer pharyngeal suture (thin submucosal connective tissue layer, striated pharyngeal wall musculature, residual prelaryngeal musculature). The pharyngeal suture is then reinforced with several pieces of Tachosil cut to size. Dry conditions, insertion of 2 Redon drains on both sides. Completion of the epithelialization of the tracheostoma at its cranial and lateral edges. Prior to this, the tracheal findings were shown to colleagues <CLINICIAN_NAME> and the joint decision was made not to use a Provox prosthesis due to the residual trachea being too far caudally. Two-layer wound closure. Application of a pressure bandage. The procedure was completed without complications. PEG placement was dispensed with in the absence of preoperative surgical information. However, this should certainly be carried out during the course of the operation, especially with regard to the necessary adjuvant therapy. Conclusion: Complete laryngectomy, modified radical neck dissection on both sides of region Ib-V with resection of the right internal jugular vein. Control of the pharyngeal suture by means of X-ray and suture pull on the 10th day requested, rapid presentation of the patient to our tumor board after receipt of the final histology for the purpose of planning further therapy. Due to a lack of information, a PEG was not used in this procedure.  ","Laryngektomie, Neck diss. bds., Tracheostomarevision

Dysphagia is not present. The vocal fold mobility is unremarkable, the right vocal fold is almost completely covered with restless mucosa, which extends into the anterior commissure. This is an indication for the above-mentioned measures, especially as the patient is difficult to adjust endolaryngeally. CT-graphically no indication of cartilage infiltration.","Induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. Subsequent insertion of the Kleinsasser D-tube and adjustment of the endolarynx. The right vocal fold up to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage is covered by a rough mucous membrane. This leaves the glottis and infiltrates the right side of the morgue sinus and the undersurface of the pouch fold. The restless mucosa ends purely macroscopically in the anterior commissure or slightly to the left of it. The restless mucosa lies against the cartilage but does not appear to infiltrate it. On the left side, the restless mucosa does not so much extend to the glottis as to the subglottis. On the right side, the subglottis is free. Due to the poor adjustability, decision to perform a partial laryngectomy from the outside. Positioning of the patient. Injection of 6 ml local anesthetic with added adrenaline in the prelaryngeal area of the planned incision. Abjode and cover. Zigzag-shaped skin incision with horizontal skin tension lines. Preparation on the larynx. Separation of the prelaryngeal musculature in the linea alba. Incision of the perichondrium and pushing off with the Freer. Opening of the larynx through the thyrofissure in the median line using a circular saw. Dissect the larynx and inspect the tumor. This appears as described above. Start on the non-tumor-bearing left side. Separation of the vocal fold and the supraglottis with sufficient safety distance from the tumor. Also removal of the subglottic area. Push the soft tissue away from the thyroid cartilage using a raspatorium. Move to the opposite side after incision of the cricothyroid membrane. Here, too, incision of the tumor, cranial horizontal incision in the upper part of the pocket fold up to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage, which is exposed at the end of the operation. Resection of the right vocal fold, subglottic resection with sufficient safety margin. Also here, removal of the thyroid cartilage and retrieval of the complete tumor specimen. Finally, marginal samples are taken supraglottically from the wound bed and subglottically, all of which are found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. As far as possible, a Kleinsasser mucosal flap is sutured to the still existing soft tissue on the right side. The patient receives 2 g ceftriaxone during the operation. Closure of the ligamentum conicum with 3.0 Vicryl sutures. In addition, connection to the inferior edge of the thyroid cartilage, after creation of suture-absorbing holes with the Lindemann reamer. Insertion of a 16 mm Keel and drilling of corresponding holes in the thyroid cartilage. Readaptation, with insertion of the Keel and closure of the thyrofissure. Readaptation of the periochondrium as far as possible and adaptation of the overlying musculature. Subcutaneous suture, with reconstruction of the intended skin incision. Skin suture with 6.0 Prolene. Prior to this, insertion of a flap to prevent air emphysema. Dressing applied. Completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: R0-resected cT2 glottic carcinoma on both sides, right-sided. Please continue Ceftriaxone for the entire duration of hospitalization.","KK-Teilresektion nach Leroux-Robert

First PEG insertion in the usual manner using the thread pull-through method. In this case, PEG insertion is successful with good diaphanoscopy. Insertion of the spandex and looping of the tongue and inspection of the tumor. The tumor is located on the right side wall of the oropharynx, starting at the anterior palatal arch and passing onto the tonsil as well as at the edge of the base of the tongue on the right. The mucosa around the tumor is incised with a monopolar needle and then the tumor is successively removed with scissors and bipolar forceps as far as possible from the upper transoral area. The tumor itself extends very far laterally into the soft tissues of the neck, so the remaining part must then be removed transcervically. Start with the neck dissection on the left side. Skin incision in a preformed skin fold across the neck, three transverse fingers below the lower jaw. Initial exposure of the platysma. Formation of a platysma flap cranially. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid and the omohyoid, the cervical vascular sheath and free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Resection of the neck block II to V, sparing the plexus branches and the hypoglossal nerve as well as the facial vein. Removal of the submandibular gland and transection of the digastric muscle to gain access to the oropharynx. Residual resection of the tumor and formation of an enoral bridge. The tumor is sent for final histology and samples are taken from all the margins for frozen section without the pathologist being able to find carcinoma or carcinoma in situ. Neck dissection is performed on the right side. For this purpose, a transverse skin incision is also made on the neck. Exposure of the platysma. Formation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid and omohyoid. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Removal of the neck preparation II a to V a, sparing all nerves and vessels except for the external jugular vein, which is ligated. The submandibular gland is left on this side. Despite everything, level I is also removed on both sides, as the tumor has partly spread to the anterior floor of the mouth. Repositioning to elevate the radialis graft. Marking of the graft and the skin incision. A 5 x 7 cm incision is made around the graft. First dissection of the venous plexus in the crook of the elbow. A good superficial and deep venous system with a relatively weak confluence can be seen. Then visualization of the brachialis muscle and the superficial venous system. Integration of a superficial vein into the graft. Exposure of the superficial ramus, radial nerve. Exposure of the radial artery and repositioning of this. Lifting of the radialis graft first from the lateral, then from the medial side. Dissection of the pedicle with clipping or bipolar coagulation of outflows. Deposition of the graft in the crook of the elbow, leaving one superficial and one deep vein for the connection. Insertion of the graft into the oropharynx and suturing of the graft from the soft palate and transcervically into the oropharynx. Suturing is extremely difficult as the tongue is very swollen and must be done mostly transcervically. Repositioning for anastomosis of the vessels. First dissection of the superior thyroid artery as the connecting vessel from the neck. Dissection of the radial artery on the graft and anastomosis of this. This has to be performed twice, as the flow was too low the first time, but the second time the blood flow to the graft was satisfactory with clearly good return flow in both graft veins. For this, the facial vein is taken once and another small accompanying vein, both of which are anastomosed using a coupler. Positioning of the pedicle with the help of Gelita and insertion of a Redon drain on both sides as well as two-layer skin closure. A tracheotomy is performed in the usual manner using the visor technique at the same time as the forearm is being sutured. Skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection down to the musculature. Pushing the muscles aside. Exposure of the thyroid gland. Separation of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Insertion between the second and third tracheal cartilage. Formation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis in the upper and lower part. Removal of the full-thickness skin from the groin in the usual manner. Insertion of a Redon drain in the groin and two-layer wound closure. The full-thickness skin is thinned and transplanted to the defect on the arm. On the arm, adaptation of the wound edges in the upper part. The full-thickness skin is sutured into the defect area with single button sutures. Perforation of the full-thickness skin and application of a VAC dressing. Apply a pressure of 75 mm Hg to the VAC dressing. Re-intubation and transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation. Continue antibiotics for 24 hours. Regular daily graft checks and clinical diet build-up, without X-ray emesis, on the 10th postoperative day. Presentation of the patient at the tumor conference after receipt of the histology.

This proved to be extremely difficult as the supraglottic tumor masses almost completely obstructed the pharyngeal and laryngeal entrance. After laborious attempts, a tube was finally placed. Performing pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy with the small bore tube. The tumor described above can be seen in the area of the epiglottis. The epiglottis is completely consumed, the tumor extends over both aryepiglottic folds to the arytenoid cartilage, on the right side the arytenoid cartilage is completely infiltrated, on the left side it extends to the arytenoid cartilage. The pocket folds are infiltrated on both sides and the lateral edge of the vocal fold is also infiltrated on the right side. Then injection of Ultracaine and sterile washing and covering. Creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Start with neck dissection on the right side. This shows several large metastases in the area of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the cervical vascular sheath. First visualization of the submandibular gland and the omohyoid muscle. Visualization of the digaster and hypoglossus. The metastases cannot be detached from the sternocleidomastoid muscle, nor from the internal jugular vein. The common carotid artery is displaced far to the dorsolateral side. Now switch to the left side in order to obtain the internal jugular vein. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the omohyoid muscle. Then expose the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and detachment of the neck preparation from the cervical vascular sheath. Several large metastases here too. Here, the larynx is first dissected by detaching the thyroid gland, the superior thyroid artery and severing the upper laryngeal bundle. Detachment of the oblique laryngeal muscles. Change to the opposite side. Continuation of the neck dissection by separating the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the lower attachment. It can be seen that a large metastatic conglomerate extends below the clavicle. Careful dissection here. Separation of the internal jugular vein and high dissection of the conglomerate, detaching it from the common carotid artery and later from the bulb. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is also severed in the upper part. The accessorius nerve can be preserved here. Separation of the internal jugular vein and removal of the large metastatic conglomerate. Then removal of the remaining fatty tissue from level II b, sparing the plexus branches. Level VI was integrated into the metastatic conglomerate. Now release of the larynx. Detachment of the oblique laryngeal muscles. Separation of the laryngeal bundle. Detachment of the thyroid gland and the cervical vascular sheath at the larynx. Detachment of the hyoid bone at the base of the tongue. Integration of the hyoid bone into the laryngeal preparation. Now perform the tracheotomy. For this, insertion between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage and reintubation onto a laryngectomy tube. Now release the piriform sinus, first on the right side, then on the left side, in the usual manner. This must be done very carefully so as not to ........ into the tumor. Then enter the pharynx from the left side. This must be done relatively high up, as the tumor is a supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma with complete infiltration or consumption of the epiglottis. This is then carefully dislocated upwards. Then incision of the mucosa along the epiglottis borders up to the postcricoid region on the left side, then the same on the right side, while sparing the piriform sinus. Now place the larynx below the cricoid cartilage. Suture marking. Taking marginal samples. The marginal sample of the lateral pharyngeal wall still shows carcinoma in situ in the center. A resection was performed and a final margin sample was taken. Final complete R0 situation. In the meantime, a Provox prosthesis of size 8.0 was placed in the usual manner using the pull-through method. Then, in the meantime, completion of the neck dissection on the left side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. For this purpose, the neck preparation was removed while sparing the plexus branches and the accessorius nerve at level II a to V a. The internal jugular vein and superior thyroid artery were preserved. Now start with the pharyngeal suture, initially in the base of the tongue with creation of a small T, but the mucosa is very dilapidated and begins to tear towards the oropharynx on both sides. Intraoperative demonstration to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. He recommends reopening the previously sutured pharyngeal suture and starting again. This is also the same as the first time with the same result that the mucosa tears again and again due to maceration. Finally, the mucosa in the area of the oropharynx must be sutured transorally and then the pharyngeal suture must be sutured in the usual manner, first in the area of the base of the tongue and then in the area of the mucosa in two layers with single button sutures. Finally, readaptation of the pharyngeal muscles so that no laryngeal stenosis occurs. Then incision of the tracheostoma and creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis and reintubation to a 10 mm tracheostomy tube. Two 10-gauge Redon drains were inserted beforehand and the procedure was completed with a two-layer wound closure. Please check the wound daily and open the throat extensively if a fistula occurs. The risk of fistula is greatly increased in this patient due to the difficult pharyngeal-mucosal conditions. A nasogastric tube is not inserted so that no additional foreign material is placed in the affected pharyngeal mucosa. X-ray gruel swallow on the 12th postoperative day. Continuation of antibiotics for 1 week.","Laryngektomie, Neck diss., Tracheotomie, Provox-Prothese

The above-mentioned surgery was therefore indicated. There is also cN1 status on the right.,"Reclination of the head. Applying the mouth retractor. Exposure of the tumor. Transoral resection: The tumor is incised on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1 to 1.5 cm. The tonsil lobe, anterior palatal arch, mucosa of the glossotonsillar junction and also approx. 25-30% of the right tongue base are removed. The resection extends caudally to the hypopharyngeal entrance. The specimen is thread-marked. After inspection of the tumor specimen, a cranial margin sample is taken from the palatal arch area. Also take a basal-lateral marginal sample from the pharyngeal wall area, behind the tonsillar lobe or in the direction of the glossotonsillar junction. In the frozen section, specimen R0 on all sides, somewhat scarce basally, but now an R0 situation when viewed together with the marginal specimen. Careful hemostasis is performed. During the transoral resection, the lingual artery was stitched and treated with clips. Re-inspection shows clips in situ, no evidence of bleeding. PEG insertion: insertion of the gastroscope. Pre-mirroring into the stomach. After creating a spontaneous diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube in a typical manner without complications. This is also fixed to the abdominal wall in a typical manner. Repositioning for neck dissection on both sides and tracheotomy. First sterile draping after skin disinfection and after injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. Beginning with neck dissection on the right: typical skin incision. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid and digastric muscles and infrahyoid muscles. Then exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, submandibular gland, vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. All structures are preserved. Removal of the larger, clearly malignant suspicious masses as part of the neck preparation. This is followed by a level II to V excision while preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Finally, careful haemostasis with RZZZ dissolution and layered wound closure with insertion of a Redon drain. Tracheostoma creation: This is performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Small Kocher collar incision. Exposure of subcutaneous tissue and transection of this. Veins are ligated. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. This is divided. Exposure of thyroid cartilage and thyroid isthmus. Undercutting of the thyroid isthmus, clamping, severing and treatment using puncture ligatures. Subsequent exposure of the trachea. Finally, creation of a broadly pedicled modified Björ flap. This is epithelized in a typical manner. Insertion of a 7 mm tracheal cannula. Neck dissection is then performed on the left through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Marking of the skin incision and careful skin incision and dissection of the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Cut through the platysma and bluntly push the platysma away from the cervical fascia. Start dissection with the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Here the anterior margin is sought out and carefully dissected from the center of the muscle caudally (region IV). This reveals the omohyoid muscle, on whose muscle belly the dissection is carried out further cranially. Sharp dissection of the submandibular gland and elevation of the gland. Below the gland, the digaster muscle is now sought out and followed in the direction of the mastoid. This is done by means of blunt dissection and with protection of the facial vein. Locate the triangle between the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. Clearing out the neck preparation. Careful preliminary work laterally on the omohyoid muscle and medially on the internal jugular vein in order to clear the medial neck preparation. This is achieved without any problems. Move on to the lateral compartment. Here the jugulofacial angle is carefully exposed. Below the vein, the hypoglossal nerve can be seen, which is exposed approx. 1 cm wide and can be spared without any problems. Continue laterally to the upper part of the sternocleidomastoid. The accessorius nerve is located here. Spread in the direction of the nerve and locate the nerve. This is spared. Now continue preparation with level IIb. Here, bipolar coagulation and sharp dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the digaster to region IIb is performed and the preparation is pulled through under the accessorius nerve. Further dissection caudally at the internal jugular vein. The common carotid artery is also exposed and the vagus nerve is visualized. This is done without any problems and both structures can be spared. Now continue dissection of the lateral compartment from cranial to caudal. The caudal border is defined as the omohyoid muscle, the deep border as the plexus branches. All these structures can be spared. After completion of the dissection of the lateral compartment, there is no evidence of a chyle fistula. The cervical sinus could not be spared. After careful hemostasis with bipolar coagulation, irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer. Insertion of a drain ( 10 ) and two-layer wound closure. Subsequent re-inspection of the wound surface intraorally after insertion of the McIvor spatula. Small areas of mucosal bleeding are still visible. These are stopped. No further bleeding. Stable vascular situation in the area of the clips. Due to the somewhat more extensive resection, exposure and ligation of the lingual artery from the cervical side was omitted, as there would otherwise have been a risk of a fistula. Stable situation at check-up, no bleeding. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please feed via the PEG system due to the extensive transoral resection. Please continue antibiotics for one week with Unacid, which was given intraoperatively. Overall cT2 cN2b tonsillar carcinoma.

Followed by transnasal endotracheal intubation. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon. A flexible esophagoscopy is performed using an endoscope, which is carefully advanced to the stomach under visualization. In the area of the stomach up to the pylorus, conditions are unremarkable. Inversion of the endoscope reveals normal findings in the area of the esophago-gastric junction. The endoscope is then withdrawn and a rigid laryngo- and pharyngoscopy is performed using a Kleinsasser tube. The glottis, subglottis and esophagus are unremarkable. The piriform sinuses on both sides, the posterior wall of the hypopharynx and the postcricoid region were unremarkable. The posterior wall of the oropharynx and the lateral walls were unremarkable. The base of the tongue was unremarkable on endoscopy and palpation. Subsequently, two self-retaining retractors were placed in the oral cavity, a rein suture was placed and the oral cavity was inspected.

The piriform sinus is tumor-free. Sonographically there is a cN0 neck status.,"First confirm the findings described above. Then placement of the LARS retractor and docking of the da Vinci robot. This provides a good overview of the tumor. The main tumor mass is located in the vallecula of the left side. The epiglottis appears somewhat infiltrated up to the midline. However, the midline is not crossed. The resection is then performed from the base of the tongue, cranially to caudally. The resection reaches the hyoid bone at the front. The epiglottis is bisected in the middle. Due to the extent of the tumor and for a better overview, the upper part of the tumor must first be removed. The resection is then continued. During hemi-epiglottectomy, the tumor is found to have grown supraglottically and endolaryngeally. The resection is therefore performed up to the supraglottis at the level of the pocket crease on the left side. Dorsally and laterally, the resection reaches the pharyngoepiglottic fold, which can be completely resected. The left ary remains intact. The tumor can then be completely removed. Representative samples are taken from the margins of the cranial and lateral resection area. Likewise, marginal samples are taken from the epiglottic margin, the supraglottic margin and the caudal margin at the base of the tongue. All marginal samples are examined intraoperatively as a frozen section and found to be tumor-free. During resection of the tumor, venous bleeding is seen in the area of the base of the tongue. This bleeding can be stopped using several vascular clips. Repeated careful hemostasis after taking a marginal sample. Then dry wound conditions. Due to the extent of the tumor and the resection area, the decision is made to perform a protective tracheostomy. Removal of all instruments and the blocker and undocking of the da Vinci system. Repositioning of the patient for the tracheostomy. Injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline in front of the trachea. Subsequent transverse incision and layered preparation in depth. Exposure of the pretracheal neck vessels and veins. These are undermined and ligated. Exposure of the prelaryngeal and infrahyoid musculature. Finding the midline. Dissection of the midline and separation of the musculature. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is then undermined and cut on both sides after ligation. Then expose the anterior surface of the trachea. Entering the trachea between the second and third cartilage clasp. Preparation of a Björk flap. Circular suturing of the tracheostoma and epithelialization. Then insertion of an 8 mm tracheostomy tube. Completion of the procedure after bandaging. The patient is transferred to the ENT intensive care unit for monitoring. After checking the swallowing function, the patient may have to be fed nasogastrically with a feeding tube for the next few days in the event of aspiration. The patient should always remain under intensive medical supervision over the weekend.","Transorale roboterassistierte Resektion

Computed tomography cT3 cN0 cM0. There is now an indication for re-panendoscopy and tumor resection. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.,"After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Carry out the team time-out. Introductory consultation with the anesthesia department. Induction of anesthesia and intubation of the patient. After fixation of the tube, the patient is positioned by the surgeon. Start of esophagogastroscopy. Insertion of the endoscope under visualization and constant air insufflation into the stomach. A typical gastric mucosal relief without irritation can be seen on all sides. After entering in inversion, the findings in the area of the gastroesophageal junction are also unremarkable. After desufflation, slow withdrawal of the endoscope with circular inspection of all esophageal sections. The mucosa is unremarkable on all sides. Remove the flexible endoscope. Insert the mouth guard and enter with the small bore tube. Initial inspection of the endolarynx, hypopharynx and esophageal entrance. This reveals normal conditions on all sides. This is followed by inspection of the oral cavity and the oral vestibule. With the exception of the large tonsillar carcinoma on the right side, the findings were otherwise unremarkable, with no evidence of a synchronous second tumor. Removal of the small drainage tube. Insertion of the McIvor oral spatula while protecting the teeth, lips and tongue. Palpatory exploration of the tonsil region. A transoral resection appears possible both by inspection and palpation. Therefore, first incision in the area of the soft palate laterally at the transition to the hard palate. Successive sharp and blunt dissection along the musculature while maintaining the necessary resection distance to the tumor. The resection is carried out taking a large part of the palatoglossus muscle with it. Laterally, the tumor extends into the parapharyngeal soft tissue. A displacement layer remains between the lateral tumor extensions and the external carotid artery. Initially blunt dissection laterally along the displacement layer caudally. Dorsally, the tumor extends to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Here too, resection is performed while maintaining the necessary safety distance. Caudally, the tumor extends to the base of the tongue. The tumor can be resected in sano both by inspection and palpation with the appropriate safety distance. A marginal sample is taken from the glossotonsillar margin to the base of the tongue and a marginal sample from the right parauvular margin. In the meantime, meticulous hemostasis using bipolar coagulation and insertion of H2O2-soaked compresses. During the frozen section by telephone, high-grade dysplasia is seen in the area of the marginal sample from the glossotonsillar to the base of the tongue. Therefore, an appropriate resection is performed here. Repeated hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Due to the extent of the resection, especially laterally to just before the branches of the external carotid artery, a layer of Tachosil is now applied in the area of the lateral wound bed. In addition, the remaining muscles are mobilized and adapted to protect the cervical sheath. Adaptation is performed using Vicryl 3-0 RB1 sutures. As part of the adaptive suturing of the musculature, long-distance coagulation of a slightly larger venous vessel and clipping of a smaller artery is also performed. Both vessels are finally covered extensively in front of the adapted muscle layer. Very good aspect at the end of the operation. Due to the extensive resection area, the decision is made intraoperatively to create a protective tracheostoma. Repositioning of the patient and skin spray disinfection. Infiltration anesthesia. Skin wipe disinfection and sterile draping. Initial palpatory identification and color marking of the thyroid incisura and the level of the cricoid cartilage. Mark the planned incision approx. 1 QF below the level of the cricoid cartilage. Sharply cut through the cutis as well as the subcutis. Dissect the prelaryngeal musculature. Separation of the muscle bellies in the area of the linea alba. Exposure of the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage. Insertion of the retractors. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining the thyroid isthmus using the Péan clamp. Bipolar coagulation of a relatively tender thyroid isthmus and lateralization of the two thyroid lobes. The anterior tracheal wall is now exposed over a large area. Enter between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. First open the trachea. Creation of a visor incision and subsequent tension-free epithelization of the tracheostoma. Subsequently, easy transfer to an 8-gauge high-volume low-pressure tracheostomy tube. The patient can be ventilated easily and adequately via the tracheostomy tube. Application of the cannula tape. Finally, a nasogastric tube is inserted. This is done via the left nostril so that there is no manipulation in the area of the extensive wound bed. Final consultation with the anesthetist.

She had also noticed dysphagia. The external CT scan from <2018> showed a high-grade cT1 cN2b cM0 tonsillar carcinoma on the right side. There is an indication for the above-mentioned operation.,"Transfer of the patient to the operating theater and positioning of the patient. Introductory consultation with the anesthesiologist and performance of the team time-out. With Cormack I, the patient can be intubated without any problems after an unremarkable tracheoscopy. Now start with esophagogastroscopy, here the esophagus and gastric mucosa are non-irritating, inconspicuous and without evidence of bleeding or a mass. Palpation and inspection of the oral cavity. The right tonsil is rough to palpate, especially in the upper area, the left tonsil is palpable without irritation, as is the base of the tongue. Now entering with the Kleinsasser tube C, the vallecula and epiglottis are inconspicuous, as is the base of the tongue; the pharyngeal side and posterior walls as well as the postcricoid region are also inconspicuous. With good adjustability, the larynx can be adjusted up to the anterior commissure, the vocal folds are also inconspicuous, the piriform sinus can be stretched open on both sides without any problems. Now insert the Mc Ivor blade and inspect the tonsil region on the right side. Here an exophytic mass is seen in the upper third of the tonsil, the caudal pole is free and can be luxated without difficulty, the middle of the tonsil and the upper pole can also be luxated without difficulty, but the exophytic mass in the cranial region extends approximately 0.5 cm from the upper tonsil pole to the anterior palatal arch. For this reason, the mucosal incision close to the uvula is made closer to the uvula than in a normal TE and a section of the anterior palatal arch is also resected, so that the tumor is incised by approx. 4 mm. Further careful dissection of the tonsil, the tonsil can be adjusted and luxated without any problems and the fibers can be stretched open and the tonsil separated from the tissue without any problems. The tonsil is not firmly attached to the tonsil bed at either end. Successive detachment of the tonsil without increased coagulation in the upper area to allow inspection of the wound edges. The resection is performed in the remaining area with a minimum distance of 7 mm, in the caudal area now dissection according to the dissection technique with bipolar coagulation and removal of the tonsil. The anterior and posterior palatal arch could be spared. Basally, the tonsil was removed deeper than in normal TE, but without opening the parapharyngeal space. Palpation revealed no further evidence of a mass in the tonsillar lobe. After careful hemostasis with bipolar coagulation, there is no evidence of increased bleeding. Relax for 5 minutes and wait, after reinsertion of the Mc Ivor spatula the wound bed is still dry. End the operation. Inspection of the tonsil. The upper pole in particular is hard to palpate, it is surrounded on all sides by easily movable mucosa, the exophytic mass is also removed by inspection and palpation in healthy tissue. The minimum distance of 4 mm on the anterior palatal arch is approximately 0.5 cm below the cranial pole. Suture marking and sending in the tonsil. Conclusion: cT1 cN2b tonsillar carcinoma on the right side. In today's operation, frozen sections were not performed and the specimen was sent for urgent histology. The histology should be discussed in the interdisciplinary tumor conference, including the performance of the neck dissection. The planning of the further procedure should be discussed.","Tumortonsillektomie rechts, Panendoskopie

Sonographically V.a. cN2c neck status. No evidence of distant metastases on external CT staging. The patient has thrombocytopenia of unknown origin.","Initially after bronchoscopic intubation transnasally via the anesthesia colleagues, start with PEG insertion. For this purpose, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy to see through to the stomach. There are clear signs of chronic gastritis with cobblestone-like changes to the mucosa and petechial bleeding, but no suspicious changes. With excellent diaphanoscopy, the stomach was punctured without any problems and the PEG tube was inserted using the usual thread pull-through method. On reflection, inconspicuous mucosal findings in the area of the oesophagus. After positioning and preparing the patient, a pharyngoscopy is performed. This reveals an exophytic tumor on the right side of the left tonsil region which extends over the anterior palatal arch into the uvula. Soft palate infiltration here at the free edge. Good distance to the hard palate. Complete infiltration of the posterior palatal arch. The posterior pharyngeal wall itself is again tumor-free. At the caudal tonsil pole there is an extension towards the pharyngeal side wall, here the tumor is clearly immobile, in the cranial tonsil area good mobility of the tumor. Insertion of the tonsil plug, good overview below. Transoral resection of the tumor using the monopolar and dissection technique. Select a safety margin of a good 1 ˝ cm, take the uvula with you, enter on the left side, subtotal resection of the soft palate to obtain the safety margin. Now good overview, here no dorsal growth towards the nasopharynx. Good delineation here. Complete resection of the anterior palatal arch. Here the tumor can be safely dissected away with a clear shifting layer to the musculature. Removal of the entire posterior palatal arch, resection up to approx. half of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Resection down to the prevertebral fascia. Now in the direction of the caudal tonsil pole, it can be seen that the tumor clearly extends like a cone towards the neck and the course of the carotid artery. This is confirmed by the CT findings. Therefore, the decision was made to obtain enoral mucosa-covering margin samples and to resect further transcervically. The marginal samples were found to be tumor-free in the frozen section diagnosis. Now turn to the neck dissection on the right side and complete the tumor resection. Skin incision at the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein, an anterior course is ligated and removed. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. A clear lymph node conglomerate can now be seen in Level II to III in the area of the jugulo-facial angle, which is firmly attached and palpable in the direction of the tonsil lobe. In addition, multiple spherical, coarse and caked, highly suspicious nodes are palpable throughout level 5. Expose the accessory nerve and secure the nerve. Now open dissection of the internal jugular vein. Clear the anterior neck preparation while preserving the superior thyroid artery and securing the hypoglossal nerve. The lymph node conglomerate is directly exposed here. First remove the accessorius triangle and level 5, where the lymph node conglomerate is clearly embedded and infiltrated in the cervical plexus. This is now subtotally resected, the lymph node conglomerate extends nuchally directly under the skin. Sharp detachment at the skin with in sano resection. Macroscopically no lymph node openings. Resection up to level 5, ligation and removal of the transverse cervical artery and the very strong accompanying veins. Resection up to the mediastinum, but no further dissection here, no exposure of the subclavian vein, finally no evidence of lymph leakage. The cervical plexus here is subtotally resected, preserved accssorius nerve. Now ligate in the area of the jugulo-facial angle with partial but clear infiltration of the V. facilais and remove the vein. Expose the carotid artery with exit of the superior thyroid artery, the lingual artery extends into the lymph node conglomerate and is questionably infiltrated, this is ligated and removed. Dissection of the hypoglossal nerve, which is clearly adjacent but not infiltrated. Now expose the external carotid artery, after securing the bulb and the outlet of the internal carotid artery. It is now apparent that the cervical lymph node conglomerate is continuously moving in the direction of the tumor, therefore en bloc resection, resection was already performed previously. Now resection of the digastric muscle, resection and connection of the inner and outer resection surfaces in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, passing the external carotid artery, safe removal of the tumor here, now only the carotid artery and the prevertebral fascia remain dorsally. With careful protection of the hypoglossal nerve, resection of the tumor with at least 1 ˝ cm mucosal clearance. Resection extends to the level of the vallecula. This results in an en bloc resection of the tumor with the lymph node conglomerate extending cervically. To assess the tumor in frozen section diagnostics, however, the attached lymph node conglomerate is now removed and specially marked using a ligature. The specimen is thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. Except for the deliberately placed margin, tumor-free margins are visible on all sides, so the situation is now R0. Now measure the enoral defect and lift a radialis graft from the left forearm parallel to the neck dissection performed here. After marking the 11 x 6 cm graft, the arm is unwrapped and the tourniquet is placed. Cut around the specimen, take along the cephalic vein and a skin monitor. Exposure of the cephalic vein. Performing the Hayden maneuver and exposing the ramus superficialis nervi radialis and exposing the peripheral vascular pedicle. Ligation of the vascular pedicle. Now careful subpastial preparation with careful protection of the radial nerve branch, free preparation of the graft up to the crook of the elbow. Here the very strong ulnar artery and the relatively slender anterior interosseous artery are secured. Preservation of both vessels. Now expose the wide venous bridge to the superficial venous system. Preservation of the bridge, elevation of a strong cubital venous branch. Reopening of the tourniquet. Regular flap vitality can be seen. Careful wound inspection and hemostasis. Later removal of the graft before insertion with removal of the artery and preservation of the anterior interosseous artery. After hemostasis, careful, two-layer wound closure and incorporation of the full-thickness skin graft lifted from the right groin. Finally, insertion of a vacuum sealing bandage and application of the Cramer splint. For full-thickness skin harvesting, cut around an 11 x 6 cm skin graft in the right groin. Strictly cutaneous elevation of the graft. Careful hemostasis, subcutaneous mobilization of the surrounding tissue and, after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drainage, careful two-layer wound closure and application of a wound dressing. Now first perform the neck dissection on the left side. To do this, also make a skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the external jugular vein and the auricularis magnus nerve. Preservation of the structures. However, the external jugular vein is relatively weak here. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical artery, the superior thyroid artery, the facial vein and the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, free preparation of the internal jugular vein. There are no conspicuous changes at levels 2 to 4, but again at level 5 a partly conglomerate-like, coarse lymph node and macroscopically, palpatorily clearly suspicious, but here without infiltration of the surrounding tissue. Therefore, after evacuation of the accessorius triangle and careful preservation of the nerve, resection of the lymph nodes and preservation of the cervical plexus. Careful caudal inspection. Exposure and preservation of the transverse cervical artery, no evidence of lymphatic leakage caudally and, after careful inspection, wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and careful two-layer wound closure after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. The tracheotomy is now performed due to the resection defect which extends to the hypopharyngeal side wall. For this purpose, a horizontal skin incision of approx. 1 cm below the cricoid cartilage is made. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the intrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Bipolar coagulation of the thyroid isthmus, which is very weak here. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björ flap and successive incision of the tracheostoma with mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequent intubation with an 8 mm Woodbridge tube. At the end of the procedure, reintubation without difficulty onto an 8-gauge cannula, which is fixed with sutures and padded with foam. The graft is now inserted. To do this, pull the graft through from transcervical to transoral. First suture the posterior wall of the soft palate. Knock back the graft and reconstruct the soft palate and suture in the area of the tonsil lobe from the enoral side. Finally, transcervical suturing of the graft in the area of the pharyngeal side wall. Final inspection, good fit and correct measurements. Now positioning of the vascular pedicle. Insertion of the skin monitor. Now conditioning of the graft vessels. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery, which is relatively similar in caliber to the graft artery. Perform the vascular anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon, carefully adapting the vessel diameters. After reopening, good venous return via the graft. With regular graft perfusion to the venous anastomosis, initial conditioning of the external jugular vein, which remains the same caliber after removal due to the metastases of the facial vein. However, the vein is anastomosed over a long distance, even after removal of the thrombus and repeated irrigation, there is no adequate venous return, so this vein is ligated and removed. Now use of a superior thyroid vein trunk suture to the internal jugular vein, peripheral placement after ligation. Measurement of a size 3.5 coupler and problem-free performance of the copupler anastomosis. Immediate regular venous return and, after reopening of the artery, good circulation and regular flap perfusion as well as excellent flap perfusion in the area of the skin monitor and enorally. Careful positioning of the pedicle and partial fixation to the omohyoid muscle is now performed. Now stable conditions in the area of the anastomosis and especially in the area of the venous anastomosis close to the trunk, which is strong and therefore at risk of kinking. Final inspection. Due to the dissection in level 5 of the extended wound cavity, a 10-gauge Redon drain is placed here. There is livid skin discoloration in the area of the direct subcutaneous dissection performed, but the surrounding skin is intact with subcutaneous tissue also present, so no resection is performed here. Careful two-layer wound closure. Multiple vitality checks of the flap and skin monitoring and termination of the procedure at this point. Conclusion: Combined transoral, transcervical resection of a markedly aggressive lymphogenic metastatic cT2 cN2c oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Intraoperative R0 situation due to the intraoperatively extensive and aggressive metastasis, adjuvant RCT is certainly absolutely necessary here due to the atypical metastasis localization, however, a second malignancy should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. Postoperatively, please perform regular flap vitality checks. Post-operative X-ray preeclampsia on the 8th to 9th postoperative day, followed by a swallowing test if the conditions are intact and, if necessary, a diet with decannulation. In the immediate postoperative course, please check the nuchal skin area where there is a potential risk of necrosis. The patient received intraoperative antibiotics with Unacid 3 g and a single dose of SDH 250 mg. No abnormalities regarding the coagulation situation intraoperatively.","Tumorresektion, Neck diss bds., Defektdeckung, Freier Lappen (Radialis), PEG-Anlage

Now place a holding suture, elevate the tongue to the left, cut around the mass in a circular fashion and extirpate it in toto. Samples are taken from the edges of the specimen in a clockwise direction and sent for processing. Marking of the remaining surgical specimen. Careful hemostasis is then performed again. Suturing of the wound edges. Ultrasound on <2008> showed several small lymph nodes up to 12 mm in diameter and hilar signs in the right tongue after PE. On the advice of <CLINICIAN_NAME>, a right neck dissection is currently being avoided. After receiving the definitive histology, a decision will be made about a right neck dissection. Conclusion: Panendoscopy and excision of a right tongue margin tumor.","Exzision Tumor i.B. Zungenrand rechts, Panendo

Prior to the operation, the patient underwent galvanotherapy, which is one of the alternative healing methods. This resulted in massive burning of the skin.","Initial inspection of the tonsil region. The tonsils are very small on both sides and rather unremarkable from a macroscopic point of view. A tumor tonsillectomy was performed on the left side due to an abnormal PET-CT finding. Incision of the anterior palatal arch and dissection of the tonsil with removal of some musculature under bipolar coagulation, then sending the tonsil marked with a thread for frozen section. Unfortunately, the pathologist found carcinoma in situ in the area of the anterior palatal arch and medially. These areas will be resected. A large resection is performed on the anterior palatal arch in the mucosal area and also on the posterior palatal arch in the mucosal area and then marginal samples are taken in each case. However, the new marginal samples are then free of tumor and carcinoma in situ. In the meantime, a PEG was performed using the thread pull-through method with <CLINICIAN_NAME> without any problems. Rearrangement for neck dissection, as already mentioned the skin looks very burnt. It almost has the aspect of postradiation skin. A skin incision is made at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Palpation reveals a very thick, large mass that already occupies a large part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. After the skin incision, dissection is extremely difficult as the tissue is sulfurously inflamed, which is due to galvanotherapy. You have to fight your way through thick scar plates and through tissue that bleeds very easily. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is exposed first in the lower and then in the very upper area. A platysmal flap is formed in the posterior and anterior region. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is first released laterally, then an attempt to release it with the laser is unsuccessful. The internal jugular vein is pulled completely into the metastasis, it is ligated above and below and then removed. The internal carotid artery and the vagus nerve can be spared, as can the coronary artery. Then remove the entire neck specimen after separating the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the upper and lower area so that the entire neck specimen can be removed en bloc with thick caked metastases. Intraoperative demonstration on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>, demonstrating that the metastasis runs directly through the cervical plexus and could not be detached from it. The plexus branches are therefore also removed. Then hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation and irrigation. During dissection, the lingual artery is torn and must be ligated. If a very radical approach is required, the neck dissection on the opposite side is initially omitted. The oral cavity and oropharynx are then inspected again. A relatively large defect can be seen laterally, where neck fat also emerges at one point. A mucosal flap is therefore formed with the posterior palatal arch to minimize bleeding and the risk of fistula. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit.","Tonsillektomie, Neck dissection

An additional suspicious focus in the right vallecula area could be excluded with regard to malignancy by biopsy during the pre-panendoscopy. Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery is now indicated. There is cN2b status on the right.","Initial consultation with the anesthesiologist. First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The described tumor is seen in the area of the palatal arch extending to the left side, just to the tonsillar lobe, on the right side transition to the tonsillar lobe or oropharyngeal side wall and growth caudally to the border to the base of the tongue. Inspection of the right vallecula again. No tumor here. Performing the PEG insertion: insertion of the esophagoscope into the stomach. After creating the diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Sterile dressing. Therefore now transoral tumor resection. The tumor is resected on all sides with a safety margin of 1-1.5 cm. The entire palatal arch, including the upper tonsillar lobe, the tonsillar lobe and parts of the oropharyngeal side wall on the right, including the wall in the deeper muscular area, are resected up to the base of the tongue, which is only resected at the edges, or up to the entrance of the hypopharynx. The specimen is removed and thread-marked, both at the edges of the mucosa and basally. In addition, a marginal sample is taken from the left in the area of the palatal arch and adjacent to the tonsillar lobe as well as caudally on the right at the border to the hypopharynx. Both the margins of the specimen and the edge samples are tumor-free. Thus R0 situation. Repositioning of the patient. Abjoding. Injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. Sterile draping of all relevant surgical areas. Start with the neck dissection on the right: skin incision curved in the typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the digastric and omohyoid muscles. Detachment of the fat lymph node package from the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein and external jugular vein. Exposure of the internal carotid artery, external carotid artery. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery, facial artery and lingual artery. Exposure, displacement and at the end of the operation re-embedding, in the sense of neurolysis, of the following nerves: hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and the branches of the cervical plexus. Overall clearing level II to V. Several definite or at least probably malignant lymph nodes cranially in level II to III. Careful irrigation and hemostasis. Transition to neck dissection on the left: This is performed in the same way as on the right side. Level II to IV evacuation is performed, exposing the structures also described on the right, as well as exposure, relocation and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the following nerves: hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and the branches of the cervical plexus. Then tracheostoma creation: small Kocher collar incision. Exposure of the subcutaneous tissue up to the infrahyoid musculature. This is split. The thyroid isthmus is passed underneath, clamped, severed and ligated using puncture ligatures. The trachea is then exposed. Exposure of a small, wide-stalked, modified Björ flap and epithelialization of the same. Re-intubation. Subsequent elevation of the radial flap: marking of the required flap dimension after measurement. Length 10.5 cm, maximum width 6- 6.5 cm. Mark the flap in the left forearm area with the central radial artery. First cut around the flap ulnarly, subfascially. Then extend the incision into the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the pedicle under the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the superficial venous system with connection between the superficial and deep venous system. Subsequent radial incision of the flap and subfascial detachment. Exposure of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. The radial artery is exposed caudally and initially clamped. After constant saturation between 95 and 100% for at least 15 minutes, the artery is severed and sutured proximally and distally using 4.0 Prolene stitches. The flap is then removed. Outgoing small vessels are treated bipolar or with clips. Dissection up to the crook of the elbow. Two outlets in the area of the cephalic vein and a smaller outlet in the area of the confluence can be dissected. Before exposing the radial artery, the interosseous artery is cut and clipped after prior clamping. The flap is then removed. Ligation in the area of the proximal venous stumps. The stump of the radial artery is treated at the entrance to the brachial artery by means of stitches above and below 6.0 Vascufil. Careful hemostasis and irrigation in the forearm area. Primary closure of the skin up to the defect. Defect is closed with split skin. This is removed from the thigh area using a dermatome and successively incorporated into the forearm defect. Subsequent application of Mepilex dressing, loose swab dressing. Wrapping with absorbent cotton. Fitting of a Cramer splint and wrapping with an elastic bandage. Attachment of the arm. Thigh area is treated with hydrocolloid dressing. After application, the hand always shows no signs of saturation and no signs of reduced circulation. Removal of the flap: After removal, the flap was already rinsed with heparin. Creation of a tunnel through the residual pharyngeal wall. This is at least 2 transverse fingers wide. Careful hemostasis here. Pass the stalk outwards into the soft tissues of the neck. The flap is sutured in successively, partly from the outside, through sutures placed in front, partly transorally. The defect can be completely closed without tension. The flap is sutured dorsally and ventrally to the remains of the palatal arch and folded. Then vascular anastomosis. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery. This can be dissected quite close to the exit from the externa in the appropriate size. The arteries are anastomosed using 9.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. A portion of the facial vein and the external jugular vein are conditioned for the venous anastomosis. A branch of the cephalic vein is anastomosed with the external jugular vein using a coupler, post-conditioning of the veins. A 2.5 mm coupler is used. After opening the clamps, there is good venous flow. Positive smear phenomenon. The other outlet of the cephalic vein is then anastomosed with the outlet from the facial vein, also using a 2.5 m coupler after prior conditioning of the vessels. Good venous return here too, positive smear phenomenon. The small outlet in the confluence area is closed with two clips. Careful irrigation and hemostasis. The wound is closed by inserting two flaps on the right side, whereby the stalk shows a visible protrusion in the area of the middle of the skin suture. Nevertheless, marking of the site for Doppler control using Vicryl suture. The left side had already been closed in layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. Here, too, careful hemostasis and irrigation were performed beforehand. Application of a pressure bandage on the right and left. The tracheal cannula is then fixed with sutures. Intraoral inspection of the flap again. This is well supplied with blood. Completion of the procedure without complications. Final consultation with the anesthetist. The patient goes to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Please continue the intraoperative antibiotic treatment with Unacid for one week. Please carry out clinical checks and Doppler checks on vitality and blood flow in the radial lobe for 5 days. Heparin 500 units/hour was started intraoperatively and should be continued for a total of 5 days. Please feed for 7-10 days via the inserted PEG tube. Food build-up according to clinical findings, if necessary after swallowing porridge. After receiving the final histology, please attend the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Resektion, Neck diss. bds., PEG-Anlage, Tracheotomie, Defektdeckung, Freier Lappen (Radialis)

A preoperative palpation examination prior to surgery was therefore not possible.,"Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, then insertion of the spandex and a covered retractor and inspection and palpation of the tumor region. On inspection, the tumor appears relatively superficial, but on palpation the tumor extends to the midline into the tongue muscles and also into the deep tongue muscles. Intraoperative consultation of <CLINICIAN_NAME> and demonstration of the findings. It became clear that defect coverage using a free transpalantate would be necessary after the tumor resection, so it was decided to perform only the tumor resection on this day and to perform defect coverage using a free radialis graft and neck dissection in a two-stage procedure. Unfortunately, preoperative planning in this regard was not possible due to the patient's lack of compliance. The diode laser was initially set to 20 watts and the tumor region was first cut around the upper edge of the tongue. In the course of the operation, the wattage must be increased to 30. The tumor is partially resected using a monopolar needle. Ultimately, the tumor is completely removed with a safety margin of 1 cm. The entire specimen is placed on cork for frozen section, all margins including the deep margins are free of carcinoma. There is still carcinoma in situ at the margin of the floor of the mouth, so a resection is taken here and a margin sample is taken again for frozen section. All margins are definitively R0. Higher grade dysplasia at the dorsal margin in the floor of the mouth, therefore a resection is taken here and a margin sample is taken, which is finally sent for histology without a frozen section. Overall, all margins R0 in the frozen section. Hemostasis with bipolar coagulation and completion of the procedure without complications. Please plan graft coverage without delay using a radialis graft and neck dissection. A day point must be reserved for this. In this case, it is also possible to perform the operation on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Friday if the pre-reserved flap appointments are already taken. The surgeon repositions the patient for the tracheotomy in the head reclination position. Injection of Suprarenin below the cricoid cartilage (8 ml). Sterile abjodation and draping of the patient. Skin incision 1/2 cm below the cricoid cartilage (horizontal). Bipolar coagulation of the superficial veins. Spreading dissection of the infrahyal musculature and vertical incision. The infrahyal musculature is pushed laterally on both sides and the cricoid cartilage is exposed. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus and undermining of the thyroid isthmus with a clamp. Bipolar coagulation of the isthmus and gradual sharp transection. Push the thyroid flaps away from the trachea and bipolar coagulation until the wound is completely dry. Identification of the incision site between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Sharp incision of the trachea after saturation of the patient. Visor tracheotomy. Suturing of the tracheostoma first at the lower, then at the upper part in the sense of an epithelialized tracheostoma. Removal of the tube and insertion of an 8 mm tracheostomy tube. Completion of the tracheostomy without complications.","Zungenteilresektion, Tracheotomie

There is now an indication for panendoscopy and tumor resection for squamous cell carcinoma that has already been histologically confirmed externally and for PEG placement. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.","After team time out and active patient identification, anesthesia is induced by the anesthesia colleagues. Transition to tracheoscopy: insertion with the rigid endoscope and smooth passage of the non-irritated glottis. Entry after endotracheal. Mucosal conditions are normal on all sides up to the tracheal bifurcation. Intubation is then performed by the surgeon. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon and insertion of the mouth guard. Entry with the size C small bore tube. Adjustment of the endolarynx. The mucosal conditions in the glottis and supraglottis area are inconspicuous on all sides. Adjustment of the anterior and posterior commissure. Here, too, there is no evidence of a tumor. Subsequent inspection of the piriform sinus on both sides. This is lined on both sides by smooth mucosa on all sides and can be freely unfolded up to the tip of the piriform sinus. Mucosal conditions in the area of the esophageal entrance and postcricoid are also unremarkable. Subsequent inspection of the vallecula and the base of the tongue. Here, too, there is no evidence of a tumor. Then insertion of the McIvor oral spatula and inspection of the oral cavity and epipharynx. Here the previously described tumorous mass in the area of the uvula base can be seen. This extends to the left paramedian side onto the anterior palatal arch. The suspicious mucosa also extends slightly to the paramedian right on the right side. Raise the uvula and inspect the posterior surface of the uvula. Suspicious, uneven mucosal conditions can also be seen here. These extend from the tip of the uvula beyond the base of the uvula to the posterior surface of the soft palate. Then mark the resection margins with the electric needle. A safety distance of at least 5 mm is maintained in all planes. Resection of the tumor under vision. In the area of the posterior surface of the soft palate, it can now be seen that the suspicious mucosal change extends relatively far cranially. The suspicious area is therefore resected under visualization. The tumor resectate is sent en bloc for frozen section diagnostics. A marginal sample is also taken in the area of the cranial soft palate posterior surface. This is also sent for frozen section diagnostics. As part of the frozen section diagnosis by telephone, questionable marginal carcinoma in situ in the area of the cranial resection surface of the back of the soft palate. Therefore, a representative resection specimen and 2 margin specimens were taken, some of which were sent in for definitive histology. Clinically macroscopically, a clear R0 resection is now present. Finally, esophagogastroscopy and PEG insertion are performed. Insertion of the endoscope under visualization and constant air insufflation into the stomach. This reveals a typical, inconspicuous gastric mucosal relief on all sides. Entering in inversion. Inspection of the gastroesophageal junction. This also appears normal and without irritation. The PEG is then inserted in the typical manner using the thread pull-through method and positive diaphanoscopy. At the end of the operation, final inspection of the enoral resection area. Repeated meticulous hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Intraoperative demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Completion of the operation without complications. Conclusion: Clinical macroscopic R0 resection of a cT1 cN1 uvular carcinoma. Should velopharyngeal insufficiency occur postoperatively, defect coverage using a radial flap would have to be discussed with the neck dissection still pending.","transorale Resektion, Freier Lappen (Radialis), PEG-Anlage, Panendoskopie

Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. A large tumor conglomerate can be seen cranially. This infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein, the accessorius nerve and also grows into the external carotid artery. Cranial and caudal insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The internal jugular vein is also removed cranially and caudally and ligated twice. The cranial operation shows that the tumor can be easily dissected from the caudal edge of the parotid gland. Subsequently, touched tissue with suspected tumor infiltration is seen in the area of the digastric muscle. All muscles of the ............... fan are also resected, as is the submandibular gland. The hypoglossal nerve is clearly infiltrated by the tumor and is also resected. Further medial dissection shows that the tumor of the internal carotid artery can be dissected. The vagus nerve appears to be infiltrated. A marginal sample is taken, which shows clear tumor infiltrates. Resection of the vagus nerve and also the border cord, which is also involved in the tumor conglomerate. Separation of the carotid artery above the superior thyroid artery and suturing of this. Further branches of the lingual artery and facial artery and other smaller branches of the external carotid artery are included in the tumor preparation. Cranially, the external carotid artery is also ligated twice below the entrance to the parotid gland, as caudally. It can be seen that the tumor is growing from the pharyngeal wall towards the N3 metastases, as already visible in the imaging. Here the tumor is incised and dissected so that the neck preparation can be pushed off to the side. When the neck dissection is continued, level V a is massively interspersed with hardened lymph nodes, which indicate tumor infiltration. This means that almost all branches of the cervical plexus are resected as well as parts of the deep neck muscles. Resection extends caudally up to the venous angle. Level V b is also resected. The final result is an extended radical neck dissection. The part that grows per continuitatem in the direction of the tumor is marked with a suture. The tumor resection is then continued. All soft tissue structures are removed except for the internal carotid artery, including the parts of the masticatory muscles medial to the mandible. Resection extends basally to the prevertebral musculature. Middle area Adherence of the tumor to the musculature. This is partially resected as well. The resection also reveals massive retropharyngeal lymph nodes, which are thickened and appear to be infiltrated by the tumor. All lymph nodes are resected. The resection extends cranially to the entry of the carotid artery into the base of the skull. A cuff of 1 cm around the carotid artery remains suspicious for tumor. From all soft tissue in the area of the cranial ............... muscles and also from the suspicious cuff around the carotid artery. This is also sent to the frozen section as a cranial basal lateral sample. A marginal sample is also taken from the middle area, from the area of the prevertebral musculature, which is sent as medial basal. Continue the resection in the caudal direction. Here it extends to the piriform sinus entrance and includes parts of the arytenoid fold. A caudal basal margin sample is taken from the deep soft tissue. Mucosal margin samples are also taken from the piriform sinus and from the lower part of the hypopharynx up to the arytenoid region. All mucosal margin samples are healthy. The caudal basal margin sample is also healthy. Tumor infiltrate is visible in the medial basal margin specimen. Extensive resection of the prevertebral soft tissues is performed and another margin sample is taken. The cranial basal lateral margin specimen is not healthy, but broadly infiltrated by tumor. Extensive resection around the carotid artery is also performed here. However, the tissue quality does not change, so that tumor infiltration can be assumed here. Another marginal sample is taken. The marginal sample from the central area is negative, but there are still extensive tumor infiltrates from the marginal sample in the cuff around the internal carotid artery, which had now been visualized until shortly before entering the base of the skull. Laterally, .......... Due to the massive infiltration, which is also visible macroscopically, there is now an R2 situation at the base of the skull. Continuation is not possible without endangering the patient's life due to the massive infiltration. Therefore, wide coagulation of the tissue. Neck dissection is now performed on the right side: visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid and digastric muscles. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, common carotid artery, internal and external carotid artery, internal jugular vein and facial vein. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery and also the lingual and facial arteries. Careful attention is paid to the preservation of the arteries. Also visualization of the external jugular artery. Several .............. lymph nodes are now also removed during level II to V evacuation. The submandibular gland is also removed on this side in order to gain the facial artery for insertion of the flap. The accessory nerve and hypoglossal nerve can be exposed and preserved. Subsequently, tracheotomy in the typical manner and epithelialization of the cartilage to the neck skin after entering the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. A small tracheostoma is created. Subsequently, the radialis flap is removed to cover the defect: the size of the defect is carefully measured in three dimensions and recorded on the forearm. Also recording a skin......... Successive lifting of the flap with skin........... First .............subfascial, then from radial. The radialis is ligated and treated using 4.0 Prolene sutures. All outgoing vessels are treated with ligatures or clips. The superficial and deep venous system is removed and exposed in the antecubital region, where it is exposed cranial to the cephalic vein and also a ............. of the radial vein. The radial artery is removed shortly before the exit of the interosseous artery. The stump is supplied with 4.0 Prolene. The veins are removed and the flap preparation is flushed with heparin. The veins are treated with ligatures. The procedure was performed under tourniquet. After opening the tourniquet, the flap reperfused well. Careful hemostasis in the area of the forearm skin. The cranial area is closed in layers. Defect is covered with split skin from the thigh. This was removed with a dermatome. Split skin with a thickness of 0.7 mm was obtained. This is successively incorporated into the defect, resulting in complete defect coverage. The thigh wound is treated with a hydrogel-Mepilex dressing. The forearm wound is treated with a Mepilex and hydrogel Lavanid dressing. Then wrap in absorbent cotton and apply a forearm splint using an elastic bandage. Repositioning of the arm splint. Due to the vascular situation on the left side, a tunnel is now created to the right side of the neck across the prelaryngeal muscles. This is three transverse fingers wide. The radialis flap is successively sutured into the defect using 3.0 Vicryl single-button sutures, whereby the overview is sometimes difficult. Tension-free suturing and complete coverage of the three-dimensional defect is achieved. The flap stalk is passed through the tunnel to the right side. Veins and arteries are conditioned here. The flap is sutured to the facial artery using 8.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. Good venous return after opening the clamps. The ..................................... veins are sutured between the cephalic vein and a branch of the facial vein using the 3.5 coupler system. After opening the clamps, good venous return............. ...... positive. The confluence of the radial artery is closed with clips. The stump of the outlet of the facial vein is also closed using clips and ligature. Subsequent irrigation of the entire wound area as well as shortly after completion of the tumor resection and careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers on both sides of the neck with the insertion of a Redon drain. The skin monitor is sutured into place via a separate skin incision on the right paramedian side due to the course of the stalk in the anterior neck area. An 8-gauge cannula with a core is inserted and sutured in place. Once again the flap from transoral, good blood circulation. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics with Unacid for one week, as well as administration of heparin via perfusor 500 units per hour for 5 days. Flap control according to the scheme for 5 days. Feeding via the inserted PEG for 10 - 12 days. Then X-ray pre-swallow and, if necessary, diet build-up. Considerable dysphagia is to be expected with the extension of the resection, therefore early initiation of swallowing rehabilitation, including presentation to the voice and speech department.","transcervicale Tumorresektion mit erweiterter radikaler Neck dissection, Lappendeckung (Radialis)

For this, insertion with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. Here, with good diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and subsequent placement of the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method. Regular esophagus on reflection. Inspection and palpation are now performed. There is a coarse tumor limited to the left tonsil, but with a clearly submucosal part. Exposure with the tonsil retractor. Mucosal incision as for tumor tonsillectomy. It quickly becomes apparent that the tumor clearly infiltrates the muscles of the posterior palatal arch submucosally. After removal of the anterior palatal arch, the tumor can be seen growing in depth per continuitatem into the soft tissues of the neck and on cervical palpation with direct adhesion to the lymph node metastasis. Complete detachment from the mucosal level, this is covered with marginal samples, which are later classified as tumor-free. Now repositioning for neck dissection of the left side. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline, cutting of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. It is palpable that the metastasis in the upper part infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Visualization of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. This shows that the posterior venter is also infiltrated. Therefore, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is now exposed caudally. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. This shows that it is completely infiltrated and occluded from approx. level III, therefore the vein is removed caudally. Exposure of the common carotid artery and vagus nerve en bloc. Dissection of the markedly hard metastasis which firmly infiltrates the surrounding area, taking level V with it. The cervical plexus must be taken subtotally. Cranially, the metastasis can be seen growing ever closer to the spinal column. In the area of the spine, the metastasis can be resected in sano, taking the musculature with it. Extirpation of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Removal of the muscular pharyngeal side wall and thus resection of the tumor with the ..............., which is located directly at the metastasis as described above. Resection with absolute infiltration of the hypoglossal nerve. After complete removal, it is now clear that the tumor surrounds the carotid bulb as well as the external and internal carotid arteries by almost 360°. After visualization, there is a clear infiltration of the carotid bulb and the internal carotid artery. Now add <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Confirmation of the findings. The tumor is now debulked as far as possible. Deposition of the external carotid artery close to the bulb. The internal carotid artery can now be freed from the tumor over a long distance. In the case of bulbar infiltration, extremely vulnerable conditions, new vascular suture required here, therefore no further measures here so that an overall R2 situation remains at the carotid bulb after complete resection. Due to the overall situation, the indication for defect coverage and vascular protection using a pectoralis major flap is now given. Lifting of the pectoralis major flap (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): First draw in the deltopectoral flap and the skin island. The skin island is 8 x 10 cm in size. In consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, cut around the skin island, then cut through a very thick layer of fat. Dissection down to the musculature. Then removal of the pectoralis major muscle from the chest wall, partly sharp, partly blunt. Blunt exposure of the pectoralis minor muscle and exposure of the vascular pedicle. This is successful without any problems. Then create a tunnel in the area of the deltopectoral flap while protecting the fascia of the pectoralis major muscle. Then cut through the pectoralis major muscle lateral and medial to the vascular pedicle. This must be done as far up as possible, as the flap must extend into the tonsil region and the defect is relatively large and there is also a large subcutaneous fat layer. Sutures are then placed in the caudal region. Pulling through the pectoralis major flap and fixation in the cranial region from the enoral side. The remaining suture fixation from transcervical. The flap was vital and supplied with blood until the end of the operation. Redon drains were then inserted and the skin was sutured in 2 or 3 layers, also in the chest area. Unfortunately, the wound in the neck area cannot be completely closed, as otherwise pressure would have to be applied to the vascular pedicle. Therefore, full-thickness skin was removed from the excess skin on the breast, meshed and covered the open defect with meshed full-thickness skin. Unfortunately, this is not completely sufficient, so that the remaining part of the secondary granulation must be left in place.","Tumorresektion, Neck dissection links, Defektdeckung (Pectoralis-major-Lappen), Tracheotomie, PEG-Anlage

Also maintain a safe distance in the direction of the morgnoid sinus. The tumor reaches close to the vocal process, but certainly does not infiltrate the posterior commissure. Dissection is now performed on the anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage. Exposure of the vocal process. The tumor can then be deposited dorsally with a tiny portion of the vocal process at a safety distance of about 2 mm. Inspection of the specimen. This is then thread-marinated. A fringe of healthy tissue can be seen all around the tumor. The specimen is sent to the frozen section marked with a thread. All the margins are marked as tumor-free. The safety margin towards the perichondrium is sometimes less than 1 mm.

There is currently a mass in the area of the supraglottis on the left side with thyroid cartilage perforation.","Induction of anesthesia and bronchoscopic intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the hypopharynx and larynx. An exophytic mass was found in the arytenoid region, which spread to the aryepiglottic fold and anteriorly to the pouch fold and vocal folds. CT morphological suspicion of thyroid cartilage and soft tissue infiltration on the left side. Using a flexible gastroesophagoscope, the patient is examined and the scope is advanced into the stomach. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions here. The PEG is inserted using the thread pull-through method. A good diaphanoscopy can be seen. Now position the patient. Injection, sterile washing and draping. Applying an apron flap in the usual manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath on both sides. Neck dissection is largely dispensed with in the case of cN0 neck status. Release of the hyoid bone. This is done without any problems. Detachment of the thyroid gland on both sides. Detachment of the oblique laryngeal muscles on the right side, on the left side this must be done carefully due to suspected soft tissue infiltration. Now detach the neck preparation in level VI on the right side, on the left side the neck preparation is integrated into the laryngeal preparation.

Then disluxation of the epiglottis and incision of the mucosa, incision behind the arytenoid region, then removal of the larynx below the cricoid cartilage. A tracheotomy was performed beforehand between the first and second tracheal cartilages. The larynx as a whole goes to the frozen section. No invasive carcinoma and no carcinoma in situ in the frozen section. Only suspected moderate dysplasia on the right side, which was not covered by the tumor. Intraoperative demonstration of the defect on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. A joint decision is made not to perform a transplant as the defect is relatively small. Therefore, in the usual manner, the pharynx is sutured in two layers, then a third layer is sutured over it as well as possible using muscle. A left-lateral, dorsal myotomy of the esophageal opening was performed beforehand and the insertions of the sternocleidomastoid muscle were reduced. The apron flap was folded back.

Entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the hypopharynx and larynx. There is an exophytic mass in the laryngeal region, which starts from the right glottic plane, infiltrates the pocket folds and the anterior commissure, extends to the opposite side and involves the entire postcricoid region on the right side. Further extended subglottic extension to approx. 2.5 cm below the glottic plane. Sinus piriformes and esophageal entrance as well as epiglottis free on both sides. Injection of xylocaine-adrenaline mixture and sterile washing and draping. Creation of an apron flap and start with the release of the larynx on the left side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the cervical vascular sheath and the omohyoid muscle as well as the hyoid bone. The 4-cervical vascular sheath is detached from the larynx. The superior laryngeal nerve, artery and superior laryngeal vein are cut off.

Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the cervical vascular sheath. Detachment of the cervical vascular sheath from the larynx. Detachment of the thyroid gland. Here it can be seen that the thyroid gland on the right side is nodularly altered and very coarse; the thyroid isthmus is also very coarse in the middle, in the sense of a nodule, altered in a manner suspicious of metastases. The thyroid gland is dissected close to the capsule so that the epithelial bodies fall dorsally. Intraoperative demonstration on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. He confirms that the epithelial bodies on the right side were not removed. Then release of the piriform sinus with visualization of the thyroid cartilage and the posterior surface of the thyroid cartilage. This is only partially successful. Then release of the hyoid bone and removal of the hyoid bone. Then enter the pharynx at the level of the epiglottis. Pull out the epiglottis. Cut along the posterior edge of the epiglottis up to the postcricoid region. Then release the postcricoid region while saving the mucosa. Release of the esophagus from the trachea. Prior to this, a deep tracheotomy was performed between the 3rd and 4th tracheal cartilage. The laryngeal preparation is then also removed at this level. A marginal sample is taken from the laryngeal preparation in the area of the trachea and sent for frozen section. There is no evidence of invasive carcinoma, carcinoma in situ or dysplasia. The laryngeal specimen itself is sent for final histology. Then insertion of a size 8 Provox prosthesis in the usual manner. Perform the pharyngeal suture in the usual manner, initially in two layers and after completion of the neck dissection by adapting the prelaryngeal muscles and the pharyngeal muscles. Then neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the submandibular gland, the accessorius nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, the cervical sinus and free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Release of the neck preparation II a to V a, sparing the plexus branches. Then neck dissection on the left side. Exposure of the submandibular gland, the accessorius nerve and the ................................ nerve. Then release the neck preparation II a to V a, while protecting the plexus branches. Then perform the myotomy at the insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides. Insertion of 2 Redon drainage tubes and insertion of the tracheostoma.

Positioning of the patient and insertion of the mouth guard. An exophytic tumor can be seen, which particularly involves the tonsil on the left side in the area of the middle and lower half of the tonsil and extends to the base of the tongue. The resection begins parauvularly in the area of the anterior and posterior palatal arch. Here resection with the electric needle. Care is taken to ensure a sufficient safety distance of more than 5 mm. The resection is carried out from the cranial to the lateral, into the pharyngeal muscles. Further resection is carried out strictly along the pharyngeal musculature, which in some cases only forms a wafer-thin bridge into the parapharyngeal space. Several larger vascular inflows are partially coagulated here, but also partially cut off. The resection continues towards the caudal tonsil pole. Further dissection along the pharyngeal musculature. It can now be seen that the tumor clearly extends to the base of the tongue. Therefore, the tumor is finally resected macroscopically in toto with a large portion of the base of the tongue. Careful hemostasis. The specimen is thread-marked for histopathological evaluation. In the meantime, a radical neck dissection of the left side of the neck is performed. This was possible due to the continuous musculature of the pharynx, which, although only partially very thin, could be preserved in continuity. The intraoperative frozen section revealed that although the margin of the base of the tongue was R0, it appeared to be very narrow. Therefore, after performing the neck dissection, an additional resection was performed in the area of the base of the tongue. This was performed without any problems. Subtle hemostasis was performed again so that the wound was sufficiently dry at the end of the operation. Neck dissection on the left. Skin incision curved in the typical manner, just below the tip of the mastoid to the level of the omohyoid muscle. Dissection of subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and exposure of the digastric muscle. A large tumor conglomerate is visible, which is fixed to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and can be mobilized by partially removing the muscle. First visualization of the facial vein, which is ligated. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. The tumor node can be dissected from the jugular vein below it. Exposure of the internal and external carotid arteries and the superior thyroid artery. Exposure, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the following nerves: vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve, cervical nerve. The accessorius nerve in particular is firmly fused to the tumor conglomerate and can be detached with difficulty, but preserved. All branches of the cervical plexus are also exposed and preserved. The capsule of the submandibular gland was removed caudally. The overall result is an evacuation of levels II to V. Apart from the clear malignancy of the lymph node conglomerate, there are still some lymph nodes in the specimen that appear to be suspicious. Finally, careful irrigation and hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drainage. Application of a pressure dressing. After a positive diaphanoscopy, the PEG is placed using the thread pull-through method. Dressing application. Final consultation with the anesthetist.","Tonsillektomie, Neck dissection sowie PEG-Anlage

After intubation with the anesthesia colleagues, the Kleinsasser tube was inserted after an unremarkable tracheoscopy and inspection of the findings. There was a relatively small finding of the left palatine tonsil, consistent with a cT2 extension; the lateral left base of the tongue also appeared to be infiltrated. Demonstration of the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME> and planning of the procedure.","Now insertion of the tonsil blocker and then start with the tumor resection. The tonsil carcinoma is cut around cranially in the healthy tissue with the electric needle and separated laterally up to the alveolar ridge. The tumor specimen is now developed and removed from the cranial to the caudal side in a plane that is easy to move in the area of the musculature. The lateral base of the tongue is also resected caudally. In between, bipolar hemostasis and removal of the tumor specimen en bloc. In between, the findings were demonstrated intraoperatively on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The tumor is thread-marked for frozen section. During the operation, it was found that the tumor was still interspersed with carcinoma in situ or severe dysplasia caudally in the area of the base of the tongue and in the area of the anterior palatal arch and the glossotonsillar groove. The decision was therefore made to perform a resection. A large piece of mucosa is resected in the area of the glossotonsillar groove in the anterior palatal arch. This is cut to such an extent that part of the submandibular gland is exposed enorally. A large section of the base of the tongue is resected caudally so that the epiglottis is completely visible on the left side. Now a flat piece from the tonsillar loge is resected in toto again to counter the dysplasia described above in the area of the upper anterior palatal arch and transitioning to the posterior pharyngeal wall. These specimens are also sent to the frozen section marked with a thread. Bipolar blood is then stopped. This frozen section is then only found to be interspersed with dysplasia in the area of the base of the tongue. After consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, a further section is cut here, which is sent for final histological assessment. Bipolar blood is now meticulously stopped and hydrogen swabs are inserted. Transfer for neck dissection on the right: instillation of 10 ml xylocaine with adrenaline in the area of the sternocleidomastoid margin. Skin incision, cutting of the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Ligation of the external jugular vein and removal. Expose the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid, the accessorius nerve, the cervical vascular nerve sheath and the omohyoid muscle. The cervical vascular nerve sheath is now exposed in the sense of the internal jugular vein, common carotid artery and vagus nerve. The posterior neck preparation is then successively removed from the upper accessorius triangle and completely removed while sparing the plexus branches and the accessorius nerve. Nodes suspicious of metastases are noted in level IIb. The anterior neck dissection is then completed by removal of the capsule of the submandibular gland, visualization of the hypoglossal nerve and three operations in the anterior triangle of the neck. Minor bleeding is coagulated. This is followed by hydrogen and ring irrigation, hemostasis and insertion of a Redon drain. The wound is then closed in two layers if the wound is dry. Now repositioning for tracheotomy: modified Kocher collar incision, cutting of the subcutaneous tissue and displacement of the prelaryngeal veins. Now expose the thyroid isthmus and undermine it. Ligature and weaning. Creation of a Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner without complications. An 8-bore tracheostoma is inserted. The patient receives 250 mg SDH and 5 mega penicillin i.v. and is admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Finally, a nasogastric feeding tube was inserted. Conclusion: cT3 cN2c tonsillar carcinoma on the left.

On CT, the tumor extends from the entrance to the nasopharynx to the hypopharyngeal junction. Laterally, per-continuitatem growth, at least in the sonography mandibular infiltration not described. Preoperative vascular evaluation shows infiltration of the externa in the upper area. In the lower area 2 to 3 free outlets.","First pharyngoscopy: The described tumor is seen, which occupies almost the entire palatal arch and extends caudally into the entire oropharyngeal side wall, growing into the base of the tongue. Hypopharynx: Lateral mucosal findings are clear. Therefore surgery with flap coverage confirmed. First injection of a total of 20 ml xylocaine 1% with adrenaline in the area of both sides of the throat. Then sterile draping. Start with tracheostoma creation: A small Kocher collar incision is made. Subsequent division of the infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped off and then supplied with a puncture ligature. Exposure of the trachea. Entering the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Creation of a broad-based modified Björk flap. This is epithelialized. Insertion of a spiral tube. Subsequently combined transoral, transcervical tumor surgery and extended radical neck dissection on the left: First insertion of the McIvor mouth spatula and the mouth retractors in alternation and placement of a tongue retaining suture. The tumor is cut around on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm. The entire palatal arch and anterior and posterior wall areas are removed. Resection extends over the alveolar ridge down to the base of the tongue. The floor of the mouth is incised forwards. The posterior half of the tongue body with the base of the tongue is resected close to the raphe. Marginal samples are taken from the entire palatal arch area, including the anterior and posterior wall, from the mucosa above the alveolar ridge, from the floor of the mouth in front, from the body of the tongue and from the base of the tongue. These are all tumor-free in the frozen section and have so far been R0 resected. The neck is then opened with a submandibular curved incision, which is extended caudally. It can be seen that the tumor has infiltrated the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extends cranially towards the base of the skull. There is also evidence of per-continuitatem growth of the tumor laterally to the uppermost lymph node stations. The external carotid artery can be dissected freely and is not infiltrated by the tumor in the lower part. The superior thyroid artery and thyrolingual trunk can still be preserved in the initial area. The facial artery must be sacrificed, as must the external carotid artery, which lies cranial to it. The internal jugular vein is removed caudally and cranially and ligated twice. The external carotid artery is resected in the area of the superficial temporal artery at the border to the entry into the parotid ligament and ligated twice. The internal jugular vein is removed at the entrance to the base of the skull and ligated twice. The hypoglossal nerve is infiltrated by tumor and must also be resected. The internal carotid artery and vagus nerve can be preserved. Accessory nerve is also resected. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is removed cranially. Resection with parts of the cervical plexus and the deep neck muscles if necessary to achieve complete removal in sano. The digastric muscle and submandibular gland are resected en bloc with the tumor in the sense of a pull through. As the operation progresses, it becomes apparent that, in addition to the per-continuitatem situation, there has also been a lateral invasion of the soft tissues of the hyoid bone. The pharyngeal wall is therefore lifted away from the prevertebral fascia. The hyoid bone is resected laterally. The upper part of the superior cornu is also resected. All soft tissues and the mucosa up to the piriform sinus entrance are resected. The posterior wall of the oropharynx and hypopharynx are resected in the necessary portion up to the oropharyngeal entrance up to half. A marginal sample is taken from the posterior wall of the pharynx up to the entrance of the piriform sinus. This is tumor-free, in the cranial area there are still questionable tumor infiltrates in small foci, approx. 1 cm below the tube area, which were partially resected. Another marginal sample was taken and then sent back for a frozen section. This is now tumor-free. A marginal sample is taken from the cranial basal soft tissue. No tumor infiltrates here either. An extensive marginal sample was taken from the caudal area, from the soft tissue at the base of the tongue towards the vallecula and the entrance to the larynx as well as the entrance to the piriform sinus. This is also tumor-free. Surgical resection can therefore now be assumed to be R0. The result is a defect from the tube to the hypopharynx, including the posterior wall of the oropharynx as well as the floor of the mouth, base of the tongue and the entire palate. The mandible was not infiltrated and the periosteum could be easily removed. The edge of the mandible at the angulus is chiseled off with a chisel to achieve a smaller transition and a better overview. All areas of the pterygoid muscle were also resected. The neck dissection on the left side was carried out including level I b and I a. Gland was also resected in the tumor. The lingual nerve and inferior alveolar nerve were also resected. Neck dissection left includes levels I to V. Neck dissection on the right side now follows. This is performed in a typical manner, including levels II to V. The defect is now covered using the anterolateral thigh flap: On the left side, a superior thyroid artery and the truncus thyrolingualis or terminal branch of the external carotid artery are available for vascular connection. The external jugular vein is available for the venous connection. This is followed by Doppler sonography in the anterolateral thigh area. Four perforators can be identified. The flap size was previously measured at 20 x 8 cm. A three-dimensionally configured thigh flap was measured and marked according to the defect. First, medial skin incision. Showing the rectus and vastus lateralis muscles. The ramus descendens can be dissected between these muscles. Then dissect the flap from the lateral side, also subfascially. Caudally dissect the vascular pedicle and ligate it. Successive development of the flap with inclusion of parts of the vastus lateralis muscle corresponding to the course of the perforators. Dissection in the direction of the exit from the profunda femoris artery. The artery and vein are removed here. Arterial and venous stumps are each treated with puncture ligatures. The primary closure is then performed in a typical low-tension manner with the insertion of a Redon drain. The thigh flap is inserted transcervically into the defect and sutured in place with relatively little tension using 3.0 single Vicryl button sutures. The complex defect is covered from the floor of the mouth via the base of the tongue, pharyngeal wall and the entire palatal arch with minimal tension. The flap vessels and the external jugular vein are then conditioned, as is the terminal branch of the external carotid artery, which is selected for flap anastomosis. Vascular suturing is performed with 8.0 ethilon sutures between the external carotid artery, terminal branch and descending ramus. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow and good venous return. Venous anastomosis between the common terminal flap vein and the external jugular vein after measuring with a Coupler measuring device using a 4/0 Coupler. Good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. Now follows layered wound closure on the right cervical side with insertion of a Redon drain. Left cervical with insertion of a flap. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma and insertion of an 8.0 tracheal cannula. Marking of the course of the flap pedicle for postoperative Doppler control. Checking the flap enorally shows a well-perfused flap. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics with Unacid for 1 week. Feeding via PEG for at least 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Heparin perfusor for 5 days ......... per hour. Regular Doppler checks according to the scheme and enoral flap checks.

The tumor is mainly located on the left side, but also extends over the midline and in the direction of the pharyngeal epiglottic plica towards the tonsillar lobe.","First of all, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The tumor appears as described. Tumor relatively flat, but extending towards the left plica pharyngo epiglottica. Mainly located at the base of the tongue on the left paramedian side with extensions to both sides. Laser resection of the tumor now follows: tumor is adjusted alternately with spreading laryngoscope, tonsil retractor and retractor. Good exposure. Start with right lateral resection. Here removal of marginal sample. Then resection left lateral as on the opposite side with approx. 0.5 -1 cm distance to the microscopically visible tumor. Subsequently, a left lateral margin sample is also taken. Then removal of the tumor from cranial to caudal. The lingual epiglottis and vallecula are also resected caudally. Removal of the tumor in one piece. Suture marking of the tumor with several sutures. Sending for frozen section. Tumor completely removed in sano. Also marginal samples in sano, thus overall R0 situation. Careful hemostasis. PEG placement, tracheostomy placement and neck dissection on both sides by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequent decision to perform flexible esophagogastroscopy for PEG placement in the typical manner. Insertion of the endoscope up to the stomach and placement of the PEG tube using the thread pull-through method in the typical manner. Now perform a plastic tracheotomy. Make an incision directly below the level of the cricoid cartilage, approx. 3 cm long. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Expose the prelaryngeal musculature and push it aside. Exposure of the anterior surface of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus. Separation of the thyroid muscle and ligation of both thyroid stumps. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Creation of an incision between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasp. Creation of a Björk flap in a typical manner. Epithelialization of the tracheostoma and reintubation with a size 8 Rügheim cannula. The patient is then repositioned for a neck dissection, initially on the right side. Creation of an incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the platysma. Formation of a platysma flap and exposure of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection along the anterior margin. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Exposure of the digastric muscle cranially and the omohyoid muscle caudally. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. Dissection along it and dissection along the cervical vascular sheath.

No B-symptomatics, no dysphagia. Nicotine abstinence for 5 years with Z.n. approx. 50 py. In 2008, a panendoscopy and ablation of 2 space-occupying lesions in the left posterior pharyngeal wall and left posterior pharyngeal/hypopharyngeal wall had already been performed. At that time there was no histological evidence of malignancy. Lupenlaryngoscopy currently shows an unclear mass in the area of the vocal fold on the right. Therefore, there is an indication for the above-mentioned operation.","Introductory consultation with the anesthesia colleague. Tracheoscopy is performed with 0° optics. The trachea is visible up to the bifurcation, no evidence of a tumor or pathological mass. In the posterior region of the middle third of the vocal folds on the right side, the papillomatous, broad-based mass is visible. Otherwise non-irritated vocal folds on both sides. The surgeon performs intubation without complications. Positioning of the patient and start of esophagogastroscopy. Careful advancement through the esophagus into the stomach while carefully protecting the patient's remaining teeth. Orienting endoscopy in the stomach. The inversion reveals a non-irritated mucosa, no evidence of a tumor, no evidence of bleeding. Aspiration of the air and careful reflection back through the esophagus with constant air insufflation. Irritation-free mucosal conditions here too. Start with panendoscopy. Careful entry with the size C small bore tube. Orienting inspection of the oral cavity. In the case of post-TE, the mucous membrane is non-irritated, the tongue is smooth and there is no evidence of a tumor. Only in the area of the oral vestibule, in the area of the incisors/upper jaw, is there a slightly hyperplastic mucosa, most likely a pressure point of the prosthesis. This does not appear to be suspicious for malignancy. Mirroring into the oropharynx. Irritation-free mucosal conditions here as well. Only the left vallecula shows a retention cyst. This was completely removed. Insertion of a suprarenin-soaked swab. Short wait. The blood is dry. Sinus piriformes can be freely unfolded on both sides, no evidence of tumor. Postcricoid mucosa without irritation. Lingual epiglottis without irritation. The laryngeal epiglottis is also without irritation. Endolaryngeal mucosa without irritation. Now adjusting the glottic plane with the aid of the microscope. This shows the previously described papillomatous, broad-based mass in the posterior region of the middle third of the vocal fold on the right. It hangs on the free edge of the vocal fold and extends to the lower edge of the glottic plane. Primarily not typically suspicious for malignancy. The papillomatous mass is removed sharply at the margins, carefully preserving the vocal ligament. On palpation, there is a slight adhesion of the mass to the vocal ligament. Since, in consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the mass does not appear to be primarily suspicious for malignancy, the vocal ligament is carefully preserved. The tissue is sent for histological processing. Insertion of a suprarenin-soaked swab. Short wait. The blood is dry. After re-inspection of the sampling site, there is no bleeding. The procedure is therefore completed without complications due to dry blood. Final consultation with the anesthesia colleague. Conclusion: Panendoscopy without complications with removal of a left vallecula cyst and removal of an unclear glottic mass on the right. The tissue is sent for histological processing. The findings on the vocal fold on the right do not appear to be primarily suspicious of malignancy microscopically, which is why care is primarily taken to completely spare the vocal ligament during resection. However, if the findings reveal a malignancy, a subsequent resection will certainly be necessary. This can be carried out using a laser if the setting is very good.","Exzision RF Glottis rechts, Panendo, MLE

Midline not crossed. Panendoscopy performed. Indication is clear.,"<CLINICIAN_NAME> Tumor resection: First insertion of mouth retractor, followed by tongue tie suture. Using an electric knife and scissors, the tumor is resected macroscopically on all sides with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm. Resection extends to just below the midline and also includes parts of the base of the tongue and floor of the mouth. Resectate is thread-marked for frozen section assessment. In addition, a lateral margin sample is taken from the alveolar ridge. In the frozen section, all margins after tumor resection in sano also basally. Thus R0 resection. Rearrangement for neck dissection. Dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME> Neck dissection: Positioning of the patient by the surgeon. Ablation of the surgical site and sterile draping. As a basal cell carcinoma has already been resected externally in the area of the left helical attachment, the resection is now performed here at the beginning. Marking of the spindle-shaped resection margins. Subsequent spindle-shaped resection of the clinically macroscopically inconspicuous scar. Inferior suture marking before placement of the post-resection. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Now proceed to neck dissection on the left side. Marking of the mandible and the ascending mandibular branch as well as the jugulum. Identify the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle by palpation. Mark the planned incision on the anterior belly of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which extends caudally to the lateral side. Make the skin incision and sharply cut through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Exposure of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. For reasons of clarity, the external jugular vein must be cut off and severed later on. However, the auricular nerve is spared. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is then exposed in its course. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle as the caudal border. Blunt dissection of the same up to the hyoid. The accessorius nerve is then exposed and protected. Dissection of the posterior digastric venter muscle as the cranial border. Proceed to dissection of the cervical vascular sheath. Locate the jugular vein at the level of the omohyoid muscle. Then successive dissection along the internal jugular vein cranially to below the digastric abdomen. This reveals a prominent superior thyroid vein. A typical venous angle with a facial vein is not found here. During the dissection, at least 2 clinically macroscopically suspicious lymph nodes are found in region II and in the area of the superior thyroid vein. It was therefore decided to extend the neck dissection on the left side to 5 regions. Subsequent exposure and protection of the hypoglossal nerve. Meticulous clearing of the accessorius triangle and successive development of the lateral neck preparation. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation. The medial neck preparation is then developed. This also includes exposure of the submandibular gland. After consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the lingual artery is now explored and ligated twice to prevent bleeding. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation. Insertion of a moist abdominal drape. Transition to the right side: Here too, at the beginning of the operation, mark the lower edge of the mandible and the ascending mandibular branch. Make the skin incision in the area of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which extends caudally to the lateral side. Sharp dissection of the subcutaneous fatty tissue and exposure of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Both structures can be spared intraoperatively. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in its course. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle as the caudal boundary and blunt dissection of the same up to the hyoid. Subsequent exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve and the posterior venter of the digastric muscle. Proceed to dissection of the cervical vascular sheath. Locate the internal jugular vein at the level of the lower edge of the omohyoid muscle. Successive dissection along the jugular vein and visualization of the vein angle. Dissection of the facial vein up to the submandibular gland including resection of the gland capsule. Subsequent exposure of the common carotid artery and the bifurcation. Subsequent entry into level II b for development of the complete lateral neck preparation. This is performed while sparing the plexus branches. After exposing the hypoglossal nerve, the medial neck preparation is then removed. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Irrigation of the wound using H2O2 and NaCl on both sides. Insertion and insertion of a 10 Redon drain and subsequent two-layer wound closure. Intraoperative frozen section analysis of the post-resection in the area of the left helical attachment showed no residual basal cell carcinoma in the processed frozen section preparation. An R0 resection can therefore be assumed here. Therefore, two-layer wound closure in the area of the helical attachment and completion of the operation without complications. Note: This resulted in a neck dissection on the left in the regions level I b, II a, II b, III, IV and V due to the intraoperative macroscopic suspicion of lymph node metastasis in regions II and III. On the right side, the neck was dissected in levels I b, II a, II b, III and IV. The operation was completed without complications.","Partielle Glossektomie, Neck diss. bds.; PEG-Anlage

Repeated careful hemostasis using bipolar electrocoagulation. The tumor has infiltrated deep into the muscles at the base of the tongue. The lingual artery and vein must be ligated. The tumor was removed en bloc and a resection was performed in the area of the posterior palatal arch, although macroscopically it was not completely free of tumor. Overall, the tumor was removed with a safety margin of 0.5 to 1 cm. Due to the extensive infiltration into the neck musculature, <CLINICIAN_NAME> decided not to perform a neck dissection at the same time and to wait for stable wound conditions.

Computed tomography currently shows cN0 neck status (primary in the tonsil cannot be visualized due to artefacts), sonographically at least a nodus on the opposite side on the right in level II.","After active patient identification, the patient is taken to the operating room. Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleague after an inconspicuous tracheoscopy by the surgeon. Carry out the team time-out. Start of oesophagogastroscopy: problem-free insertion of the endoscope into the oesophagus and advancement into the stomach. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions on all sides. The mucosa in the esophagus is also normal. Then carry out the panendoscopy: first inspect and palpate the oral cavity, tongue, base of the tongue and floor of the mouth. A tumor measuring approx. 1 to 1 ˝ cm is palpated in the left tonsil. Otherwise unremarkable findings. Now insertion of the mouth guard and insertion of the size C small bore tube. Tonsil lobe on the right and base of tongue as well as vallecula with epiglottis are unremarkable. Inconspicuous hypopharynx. Inconspicuous endolarynx. Now irrigation of the endolarynx with sodium chloride by <CLINICIAN_NAME> (<STUDY_NAME> study). Then proceed to tumor tonsillectomy on the left side: insertion of the McIvor oral spatula. The carcinoma is exophytic in the lower half of the left tonsil, with no evidence of deep infiltration. Therefore, initially start as for normal tonsillectomy with parauvular mucosal incision and dissection of the capsule. Exposure of the upper pole vessels and bipolar coagulation as well as removal of the upper pole vessels. Then dissect along the capsule up to about half of the tonsil. Subsequently, in the area of the lower half of the tonsil, where the carcinoma is located, work is carried out at a distance of approx. 0.5 to 1 cm, both in terms of the mucosa and the depth. Therefore, the muscles of the palatine arch were taken to the depths and the excision extended to the base of the tongue. Repeated bipolar coagulation of several vessels. At the end, a prominent vessel is stitched twice. The removed tonsil is then examined. A PE for the <STUDY_NAME> study is obtained from the middle of this. Otherwise, the resectate distance to the healthy person in the caudal area is relatively small at approx. 4 to 5 mm compared to the other margins. Therefore, resectate in the caudal mucosa area. Both specimens are now sent for frozen section. Subsequently, with protracted bleeding from the base of the tongue, a deep incision is also made here after multiple bipolar coagulation and continued bleeding. Subsequently dry conditions. The operation was therefore completed at this point without complications. Conclusion: cT1 tonsillar carcinoma on the left. Computed tomography cN0 neck status, sonography also cN0, but with a suspicious nodus in level II on the right that is worth checking. In addition, several thyroid nodules, some without ......... and microcalcifications, therefore nuclear medicine clarification recommended here (scintigraphy unfortunately only possible in 2 ˝ months due to the CT scan performed). Due to the suspicious nodus in level II on the opposite side, primary advice for selective neck dissection on both sides.","Tumor-Tonsillektomie, Panendo

Due to the patient's condition following radiochemotherapy of up to 64 Gy in the past, a tumor resection was indicated.","Panendoscopy at the beginning of the operation. This shows a tumor island in the area of the arytenoid hump on the left side. Otherwise, a main tumor mass can be seen in the area of the pocket crease on the right side, which completely occupies it and also extends from here towards the morgue sinus. From here, the tumor extends into the area of the anterior commissure and appears to cross it at the median line. The glottic plane itself appears to be tumor-free. The panendoscopy is then completed with otherwise unremarkable mirror conditions. After repositioning the patient, inject local anesthetic with adrenaline pretracheally. Then transverse incision above the trachea and preparation in depth. Locate the prelaryngeal muscles, which are cut in the median plane. Further preliminary preparation in depth and exploration of the thyroid isthmus. As this is only very small, it is only coagulated extensively and then cut. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Now open the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage clasp. Preparation of a Björk flap. Then circular suturing of the tracheostoma and insertion of a size 7 tracheostomy tube after extubation of the patient. The patient is then repositioned for the TORS procedure. Insert the LARS blocker for this. Exposure of the epiglottis. Then perform an epiglottectomy from the base of the tongue. The incision is made with the monopolar over the plica pharyngoepiglottica backwards to the arya. Here, horizontal placement above the ary, taking along the tumor island located on the median surface. From here, resect endolaryngeally down to the pocket fold level. Here, the tumor is then deposited on the upper edge of the morgue sinus. The dissection is then continued ventrally. Then vertically split the epiglottis and initially remove the left part of the tumor up to the anterior commissure. The hemiepiglottectomy is then performed on the right side. Preservation of the pharyngoepiglottic plica. The entire ary appears not to be covered by the tumor. Therefore, only resection of the entire pocket fold up to the lower edge of the morgue sinus, the upper part of which also appears to be infiltrated by the tumor. From here, resection into the anterior commissure, where the tumor can be removed. The tumor is then resected in the area of the anterior commissure. This specimen is sent separately for histopathological examination. Now take marginal samples from the anterior commissure on the ary on the left side. The separate samples of the anterior commissure and the arytenoid region on the left are sent for frozen section diagnostics. The samples are found to be tumor-free by the pathologist. Therefore, after careful bleeding control, no further measures are taken. A nasogastric feeding tube is then inserted and the procedure is completed after removal of the Lars blocker. Initially nutrition via the nasogastric tube for the next 5 days. Then slowly build up oral nutrition depending on the tendency to aspirate. In a second session, neck dissection must be planned on both sides in 2-3 weeks.

In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, indication for primary surgical procedure.","First, after preparation by the anesthesia colleagues, inspection of the primary tumor. An exulcerated tumor of the left soft palate with a depleted uvula was found. Submucosal infiltration of the soft palate approx. 1 cm with a pronounced small cone of just under 2 cm on the left. The submucosal lesion extends to the upper pole of the tonsil, the suspicious change extends to half of the left tonsil, otherwise the tumor can also be palpated. First of all, perform the PEG insertion. To do this, enter with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy advancement into the stomach. After excellent diaphanoscopy, problem-free puncture of the stomach and placement of the PEG tube size 15 Charričre using the usual suture pull-through method. Subsequent repositioning for tumor resection, this is done transorally. Insertion of the tonsil plug, cutting around the tumor with a safety margin of just under 1 cm. Resection with monopolar needle and dissection technique. Subtotal resection of the soft palate on the left. Resection up to the upper tonsil pole on the right, left-sided removal of the anterior palatal arch and performance of a tonsillectomy in the area of the regular and unchanged capsule. Deposition at the base of the tongue with macroscopically inconspicuous conditions. Completely covering marginal samples are now taken both on the specimen and in situ. These are diagnosed as completely tumor-free in the frozen section diagnosis. Therefore, intraoperative R0 situation, meticulous hemostasis and measurement of the defect measuring up to 8 x 5.5 in total in dry wound conditions. If tongue swelling has already clearly set in after tumor resection, a shot tracheotomy is performed later. First turn to neck dissection of the left side. To do this, make a submandibular incision approx. 2 QF below the lower jaw, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein, exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the digasatric muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland, removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical sinus, the hypoglossal nerve, the facial vein and the superior thyroid artery. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and the upper level Va with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. The submandibular gland is excised later. Subcapsular procedure and preservation of the oral branch. The facial vein is later removed for reasons of space. Exposure and preservation of the facial artery initially, which is later also ligated and removed. Resection of the digastric muscle. Entering pharyngeally at the level of the caudal tonsil lobes. Widen the pharyngotomy up to a width of approx. 3 QF, finally wide and soft conditions for subsequent pedicle positioning. Turn to the neck dissection of the right side. Also corresponding to the opposite side, skin incision, cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and dissection of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical anus, the hypoglossal nerve, the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Dissection of the accessorius triangle and the upper level Va, carefully preserving the cervical plexus branches. Final inspection and, if conditions are dry, wound irrigation, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Now turn to lifting the radialis graft from the left forearm. After marking the graft, which measures 9 x 5.5 in total and has a special soft palate configuration, the tourniquet is applied. Cutting around the graft. Exposure and entrainment of the distal cephalic vein. Performing the Haydn maneuver. Identification of the ramus superficialis nervi radialis. Ulnar exposure of the musculature, strictly subfascial approach here. Identification of the distal vascular pedicle, removal of the vasa radialia after ligation, strictly subfascial preparation, the ulnar vascular nerve bundle is not exposed. Subfascial release of the graft and proximal dissection after exposure of the strong ulnar artery, isolation of the radial artery, exposure and preservation of the common interosseous artery, exposure of a narrow bridge between the cephalic vein and the deep venous drainage system, but with strong venous confluence here, the deep venous confluence is later prepared for primary anastomosis. Isolation of the veins. Reopening of the tourniquet with excellent flap vitality Careful hemostasis is performed on the graft and the forearm. There is better venous flow for the deep draining vein, therefore ligation of the cephalic vein. A monitor was not used as the graft was clearly visible. Subsequently, the vital graft was removed after ligation of the draining vessels. The graft was then removed, the wound carefully closed in two layers and the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the right groin was inserted. Then application of the vacuum-sealing dressing and application of the stretcher splint in the functional site. Removal of the full-thickness skin graft. To do this, mark the graft oval, lift a graft of approx. 11 x 5 cm, cut around the oval, strictly cutaneous lifting. Careful subcutaneous mobilization. Subsequent insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain with dry wound conditions and strong multi-layer wound closure. Subsequent skin suturing. The plastic tracheotomy was performed at the same time as the radialis graft removal. For this purpose, a horizontal skin incision was made at the level of the cricoid cartilage to separate the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature, separation of the musculature, exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, transection of the thyroid isthmus after ligation and repositioning. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap. Incision of the tracheostoma in the usual manner and subsequent problem-free reintubation to a size 9 low cuff cannula. After insertion of the graft from cervical to enoral, adaptive incision of the graft is performed, overall good fit, subsequent tightness on all sides. Left-sided positioning of the vascular pedicle. Conditioning of the flap vascular pedicle, followed by conditioning of the superior thyroid artery. Careful suturing of the arteries with 8.0 Ethilon. Due to the repositioning, the intake conditions were considerably more difficult, but subsequently the flow conditions were problem-free and sufficient and venous return was immediate and regular. Conditioning facial vein, which despite previous deposition ........ flow conditions. Measurement of a size 3.0 coupler and problem-free implementation of the venous anastomosis with the coupler, followed by good flow conditions and vital enoral graft, so that after final wound inspection, a 10-gauge Redon drain was inserted, careful two-layer wound closure and termination of the procedure with a vital graft and transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis with Unacid 3 g. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT2 cN0 oral cavity carcinoma on the left, abstinence from food initially for 7-8 days, then with regular enoral healing, gradual food build-up and decannulation with regular swallowing function.","Resection, Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

Adjustment of the pharynx with the laryngoscope. Insertion of the flexible esophagoscope. Advance into the stomach: inconspicuous conditions there. If diaphanoscopy is good, PEG insertion in the usual way using the thread pull-through method. No bleeding. Perioperative administration of Unacid. Please continue this for a few days postoperatively. Hypopharyngoscopy performed again: After adjustment with the small water tube, the tumor at the entrance in the hypopharynx on the left can be seen very clearly, which is relatively easy to move and can be pushed away from the arytenoid cartilage. Decision to perform a neck dissection on both sides with tracheotomy and lateral pharyngotomy with tumor extirpation. Repositioning of the patient and skin disinfection. Infiltration anesthesia in the area of the right and left side of the neck. Start on the left. Marking of a platysmal flap. Cut around the platysmal flap and dissect it as far as the submandibular gland. At the same time, perform the neck dissection, cutting through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle after dissection of the platysmal flap medially. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, the facial vein, which remains intact. Exposure, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the vagus nerve and the accessorius nerve. Exposure of the posterior digastric venter muscle. Dissection of the posterior neck preparation, first clearing level IIb, then continuing cranially to IV beginning V. After detachment and transection of the omohyoid muscle, finally transection of the fatty tissue and its supraclavicular transection. Removal of the posterior neck preparation. Now dissect anteriorly. Removal of the capsule of the submandibular gland. Exposure, displacement, neurolysis and re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery and the superior laryngeal nerve. Preparation of the anterior neck specimen and also submission for definitive histology. Exposure of the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage and the posterior edge. Removal of the upper horn of the thyroid cartilage and detachment of the piriform sinus from the thyroid cartilage. Resection of part of the thyroid cartilage. Entering the pharynx. Perform a lateral pharyngotomy below the hyoid bone. The tumor can be clearly seen at the entrance to the hypopharynx. It is circumcised in a circular fashion while sparing the laryngeal structures. The arytenoid hump is clearly visible but remains intact and part of the mucosa of the arytenoid hump must also be removed. In some cases, resection of part of the aryepiglottic fold. Removal of circular margin samples. These are all found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. Due to the relatively circumscribed defect, it is not necessary to create a flap. The platysmal flap is therefore moved back later. A primary multi-layered wound closure of the mucosa is now performed. This is very successful. The thyroid gland is dissected caudally, set down at the caudal pole and swung upwards to additionally reinforce the pharynx on this side and is stitched directly onto the pharyngeal suture. Extensive hemostasis with bipolar coagulation and irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. No more bleeding. Insertion of a Redon drain. Repositioning of the platysmal flap. Subcutaneous sutures, skin suture. Pressure bandage. Repositioning for neck dissection on the opposite side. Infiltration anesthesia.

On CT, the tumor extends to the internal carotid artery, which shows kinking here. The above-mentioned operation is therefore indicated.","First, pharyngoscopy again: The exophytic tumor in the area of the tonsil lobe with transition to the palatal arch is confirmed, smaller flat extensions caudally onto the lateral wall of the oropharynx and towards the posterior wall of the oropharynx are visible. Therefore indication for surgery confirmed. PEG insertion: insertion of the flexible esophagoscope. After creating the diaphanoscopy, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube in a typical manner without complications. Positioning of the patient. Skin disinfection. Injection of a total of 20 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. First start with radical neck dissection on the right: skin incision typically widened slightly caudally. Depiction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is infiltrated by lymph node metastases. Showing digastric muscle, omohyoid muscle. Depiction of the internal jugular vein, which is infiltrated cranially by the metastasis. Depiction of the common carotid artery, internal/external carotid artery. These can be dissected from the metastatic conglomerate. Depiction of the hypoglossal nerve. This must also be dissected. The nervus accessorius extends into the lymph node conglomerate and is also resected. Some branches of the cervical plexus, which are involved in the tumor, must also be resected in the cranial to middle area. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is removed caudally and cranially and also resected. Parts of the deep neck muscles in the cranial area must also be resected as they are also infiltrated. The internal jugular vein is removed caudally and cranially and ligated twice. However, the most caudal part of the internal jugular vein with an outgoing facial vein can be preserved for the vascular anastomosis. Vagus nerve border cords are exposed and preserved. Neck dissection on the left, performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Depiction of the omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein, internal/external carotid artery, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. All structures are visualized and preserved. Clearing from level II to V. This is also done while exposing and preserving all branches of the cervical plexus. Finally, careful hemostasis and wound closure in the typical manner with insertion of a Redon drain. Tracheostoma creation: Small Kocher collar incision. Dissection through subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature. This is split. Thyroid isthmus, which is very small, is dissected after bipolar coagulation. The anterior wall of the trachea is exposed. The trachea is opened in the 2nd to 3rd intercartilaginous space and a wide-based, modified Björk flap is created. This is epithelized in the typical manner. Subsequently, reintubation with insertion of a Woodbridge tube. Then tumor resection combined transorally and transcervically: The tumor is first removed macroscopically from all sides transorally at a distance of at least 1 cm. The anterior palatal arch is completely removed and parts of the posterior palatal arch are removed. The tumor is removed along the tonsil capsule, as this is a good boundary layer. Glossoalveolar groove, marginal parts of the base of the tongue and the pharyngeal side wall up to just before the entrance to the hypopharynx are also removed. Tumor specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section. Similarly, a marginal sample from the medial edge of the pharyngeal wall at the border to the posterior wall. This is also thread-marked and sent for final histology. Here, there are very narrow gaps in the basal direction, so that a resection is recommended. Carcinoma in situ infiltrates are also found in the middle section of the marginal specimen in the medial direction of the pharyngeal wall, so that a resection is also necessary here. For the resection, the internal/external carotid artery was previously dissected and the kinking of the internal carotid artery was also separated from the pharyngeal wall. All soft tissue is now removed from the inside of the lower jaw from the cranial side next to the palatal arch down to the hyoid bone. All soft tissue remaining from the pharyngeal tube is removed. A wide resection is also obtained from the medial pharyngeal wall, which is marked with sutures remote from the tumor. The soft tissue margin sample and the margin sample from the medial pharyngeal wall are sent to the frozen section again. Here, no further tumor infiltrates are visible in the soft tissues. Only moderate dysplasia on the pharyngeal wall, no carinoma in situ. Thus now an R0 situation. There is a defect from the palatal arch next to the uvula down to the piriform sinus entrance. As no radial flap is possible, a thigh flap is removed to cover the defect: Several perforators can be made out in the line from the superior spina to the lateral patella and these are marked. After measuring the size of the flap, the dimension is 13 x 8 mm. This flap size is marked around the perforators accordingly. First make a skin incision medially up to the fascia. Then cut through the fascia. Depiction of the rectus femoris muscle. Incision is extended slightly cranially, between rectus femoris and vastus lateralis to find the ramus descencus. However, this does not run directly next to the vastus lateralis but into the muscle at the lower edge of the vastus lateralis. Departure of several perforators can be observed. Separation of the vastus in the medius from the intermuscular septum. The vascular pedicle is followed distally. Here the vascular pedicle is deposited in the caudal region. Then make a skin incision on the lateral side up to the fascia. After cutting through the fascia, successive lifting of the flap with muscle cuff. This muscle cuff is slightly enlarged as the vessels run into it from the caudal instead of the lateral side. Successive lifting of the muscle. Branches of the femoral nerve to the muscles are all preserved as far as possible. Subsequent dissection of the vascular pedicle up to the entrance of the artery into the profunda femoral artery. Outgoing smaller arterial vessels are ligated or clipped. Two accompanying veins are also lifted, outgoing vessels are ligated or clipped. Cranially, a confluence is divided into three outgoing vessels in front of the entrance to the femoral profunda vein. After complete elevation of the flap including the pedicle, there is good pulsation in the area of the descending ramus and at least two of the outgoing perforators. Blood flow in the flap is regular. Subsequently, the artery, which is cut off cranially with 4.0 prolene sutures, is removed using the puncture technique. The smaller outgoing veins are ligated. The outlet from the profunda femoral vein is treated with 4.0 prolene sutures over and under the vein. After removal of the flap, irrigation with heparin. The wound on the thigh is closed in layers after extensive hemostasis. The fascia is also sutured. Wound closure with insertion of two Redon drains. Now suture the flap into the defect. The flap is inserted into the neck in such a way that excessive tension between the skin and muscle in relation to the perforators is avoided. Successive suturing of the flap into the defect using 3.0 Vicryl single-button sutures, which is partly done by advancing the sutures. The flap can be sutured into the defect with relatively little tension and in a three-dimensionally correct manner. The vessels are then trimmed for the vascular suture. The facial artery is selected. This is sutured to the descending ramus after widening the lumen of the facial artery using the fish-mouth technique with 8.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. Trimming of the veins. The facial vein, which opens caudally into the still open internal jugular vein, is selected. This is anastomosed with the confluent vessel from the profunda femoral vein. A coupler size 3.0 is selected for this purpose. After opening the arterial clamp, good venous return or after opening the veins, good venous return, smear phenomenon positive. However, pulsation via the perforators is relatively weak. ......... Control brings little reflux. Disturbance in the perforator area, e.g. spasm, cannot be ruled out with certainty, but pulsation via the anastomoses and the large vessels is regular. Further measures currently not advisable. Therefore now careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a flap. Skin closure on the left is also performed after hemostasis and insertion of a Redon drainage. Insertion of a size 8 tracheostomy tube, which is fixed with sutures. Completion of the procedure without complications. Overall cT2-3 tonsil/oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. cN2b status required radical neck dissection. Defect coverage by means of thigh flap from the right side. Circulatory situation uncertain at the end. Patient transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Here regular checks of flap perfusion according to schedule. Heparin perfusion, which was started intraoperatively at 500 units per hour, should be continued. Please continue antibiotics, which were started intraoperatively with Unacid, for one week. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube. Flap insufficiency due to perforator insufficiency possible, then defect closure preferably by means of pecoral major flap according to the clinical course.","Pharyngectomy, Neck dissection, Free flap (ALT), PEG placement

Therefore above mentioned surgery indicated.,"First induction of anesthesia by the anesthetist. Then bronchoscopic intubation by the anesthetist. This is very difficult as the large tumor masses almost completely obstruct the glottic plane. Ultimately, the patient can be intubated transnasally by bronchoscopy. Then we enter with the Kleinsasser tube and inspect the hypopharyngeal and laryngeal areas. Another detailed inspection of the tumor. As already described, the tumor begins at the lower tonsil pole, moves down the lateral pharyngeal wall and infiltrates the lateral and medial wall of the piriform sinus. However, the tip of the piriform sinus is free. Then infiltration of the postcricoid region and the pocket fold region in the right laryngeal region. Then placement of a feeding tube and sterile washing and draping. Start with the creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Then perform a modified radical neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the omohyoid muscle. Locating the accessorius nerve. This is difficult, as there are several large metastases in the area of level II a and b, which are first carefully detached. These can be dissected away from the jugular vein although they are directly attached to it. Dissection of the entire internal jugular vein. Removal of the remaining level II a and b. Levels III, IV and V are still covered with hard, rough metastases. These metastases are also located between the plexus branches and some plexus branches unfortunately have to be sacrificed in order to cleanly remove the metastases. The vagus nerve and border cord can be spared. The metastases themselves are directly adjacent to the internal and common carotid arteries, but can be easily dissected away from them. Then perform neck dissection level VI. Release the hyoid bone from the left side. Dissect the cervical vascular sheath on the right side of the larynx and hypopharynx. Skeletonization of the larynx. Separation of the entire laryngeal musculature. Exposure of the pharynx directly above the hyoid. Performing a pharyngotomy and extracting the epiglottis. Clamping of the epiglottis and cutting around the tumor with a sufficient safety distance, taking the hyoid bone with it. In the area of the pharyngeal side wall on the right, the tumor is resected, but with a very small safety margin, so a marginal sample is immediately taken again and sent for a frozen section. Fortunately, no tumor cells, no carcinoma in situ or higher-grade dysplasia. Further exploration of the larynx along the postcricoid region. First release of the thyroid gland and free preparation of the trachea. Entering the trachea and performing a tracheotomy. Performing a mucocutaneous anastomosis in the lower region. Re-intubation. Then return to the laryngeal preparation. The larynx is completely released along the postcricoid region and the cricoid cartilage. Separation of the larynx from the posterior wall of the trachea. The posterior wall of the trachea is cut upwards like a flap. The entire laryngeal preparation is sent to the frozen section marked with a suture. The pathologist is unable to detect carcinoma in situ, inverse carcinoma or high-grade dysplasia at the edges. Now the myotomy is performed. For this, the esophageal entrance and the esophagus are opened digitally and the constrictor muscles are cut with sharp scissors so that ultimately only the mucosa remains. The myotomy is performed posteromedially as usual. The lower attachments of the sternocleidomastoid muscle are then incised to create a flatter stoma. This is performed on both sides using the monopolar knife. After securing the R0 resection, elevation of the left forearm flap. Marking of the flap in a size of approx. 9 x 6 cm. Marking of a skin monitor. Subsequent resection of the flap from the ulnar side. Preparation of a subcutaneous bridge to the skin monitor on both sides. The incision is extended to the crook of the elbow. Then locate the superficial venous system. Integration into the subcutaneous bridge to the skin monitor. The flap is then lifted from the lateral side. Exposure of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. Distal clamping of the radial artery. Saturation always at 98 to 100 %. After approx. 15 minutes with good saturation, the artery is removed. This is ligated proximally distally with 4-0 Prolene. Then lift the flap subfascially. Smaller vessels are coagulated bipolar or treated with clips. Exposure and connection between the superficial and deep venous system in the antecubital region. Exposure of the radial artery. Clamping of the interosseous artery. If good saturation is maintained, closure of the. Interosseous artery using clips. Two good venous outlets from the cephalic vein can be visualized. Removal of the flap. Veins are ligated. The artery is closed in the entry area into the brachial artery using 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Then flush the flap with Ringer's solution. Before insertion of the flap, a left myotomy is performed in the typical manner. Complete transection of the muscle fibers. Esophageal wall is opened slightly distally at the entrance area to ensure greater passage. Provox prosthesis cannot be used primarily due to the overall situation. Flap is successively incorporated into the defect with 3-0 Vicryl single-button sutures. Tension-free closure. Stem is placed to the right. Conditioning of the radial artery and the superior thyroid artery. Suture with 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. Opening of the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. Two branches of the cephalic vein are selected for the anastomosis. The radial vein is clipped. One end of the cephalic vein is easily clipped to an outlet of the facial vein after selecting a 3-0 coupler. After opening the clamp, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The other part of the cephalic vein is coupled with the external jugular vein using a 3-0 coupler; here too, good venous return after opening the clamp, positive smear phenomenon. Subsequent careful irrigation of the wound area. Hemostasis. Wound closure in layers and placement of a Redon drain on each side, epithelialization of the tracheostoma and insertion of the skin monitor via a small transverse skin incision at the upper edge of the right apron incision. A 10 mm tracheostomy tube is then inserted and secured with sutures. In the thigh area, a piece of 0.8 mm split skin is removed in the corresponding size of the defect. Hydrogel dressing is applied to the thigh area. The forearm is primarily closed in the cranial area. In the caudal area, the defect is covered by suturing the removed split skin. Hydrogel-Mepilex dressing is then applied. Loose compresses are applied on top. Wrapping with absorbent cotton. Fitting of a Cramer splint in functional position. Wrap with elastic bandage. Arm always well saturated until the end. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Insertion of Redon drains, one per side. Fixation of the Redon drain on the inside of the anastomosis, otherwise on the outside as usual. Two-layer wound closure and completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis in the tracheostoma area. Insertion of a tracheal cannula. Fixation by suturing the tracheostomy tube and completion of the procedure without complications. Please continue antibiotics, which were started intraoperatively with Unacid, for at least 2-3 days. Feeding via the PEG tube that was placed during the last operation for at least 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Flap control via skin monitoring or using a Doppler probe for 5 days. Continue heparin perfusor 500 E/hour for 5 days. Total cT4 cN2b hypopharyngeal carcinoma with invasion of the right laryngeal skeleton. Discuss postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy versus radiochemotherapy according to the histologic findings.","LE with partial pharyngectomy, Modified radical neck dissection Level II-V, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

Furthermore, the tumor extends caudally along the lateral wall of the oropharynx and infiltrates the base of the tongue and extends to the vallecula. The vallecula itself is free. The epiglottis, hypopharynx and larynx are also free. Due to the location and size of the tumor, a decision was made to resect the tumor and cover the defect with a radialis graft.","Induction of anesthesia and transnasal intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. First, tumor resection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: The exophytic tumor is seen, which is located in the area of the tonsillar lobe, extends over the glossoalveolar groove to the base of the tongue, also runs towards the soft palate, but does not quite reach the border of the posterior palatal arch; the tumor extends caudally to below the tonsillar lobe. Now insertion of retractors or McIvor oral flaps alternately and suturing of the tongue. The tumor is successively incised macroscopically with a safety margin of at least 1 to 1.5 cm. Resection covers the posterior palate, anterior palate, lowest parts of the buccal mucosa at the border to the alveolar ridge, further along or above the alveolar ridge in the anterior direction, then via the glossoalveolar groove into the base of the tongue. Dorsocaudally, the resection extends over the posterior palatal arch to the adjacent pharyngeal side wall and finally just in front of the hypopharynx towards the base of the tongue and floor of the mouth. The floor of the mouth is also resected in the dorsal parts. The lingual nerve is located in the resection area and is also resected, as are the dorsal parts of the sublingual gland. The uppermost parts of the submandibular gland are also included in the preparation. Craniobasally, the resection extends in depth to the styloid process, which is exposed and the tumor is successively resected, taking the entire pterygoid musculature with it. The carotid artery is still palpable under the styloid process or under a thin soft tissue sheath and is not directly exposed. Finally, the entire tumor is removed and suture-marked in a typical manner. A marginal sample is taken cranially from the soft palate to the border of the alveolar ridge and also thread-marked. In addition, a marginal sample is taken anteriorly, which is also thread-marked and extends from the edge of the tongue to the alveolar ridge along the floor of the mouth. In the frozen section, despite ample safety margins of 1 to 1.5 cm, there are still in situ infiltrates or moderate to high-grade dysplasia in the area of the palatal arch, base of the tongue and along the alveolar ridge. Therefore, another marginal sample is taken medially on the pharynx with suture markings, as well as a marginal sample from the palate to the alveolar ridge with markings remote from the tumor and a marginal sample from the tongue area medially including caudal to the base of the tongue, also with suture markings here. Also a marginal sample from the alveolar ridge anterior lateral. No evidence of higher-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma in the marginal samples taken. Similarly, no carcinoma in the marginal samples taken at the beginning, also no invasive carcinoma or higher-grade dysplasia. Therefore, surgical R0 resection, although there is a suspicion that there may be a tendency towards field cancerization. Then perform PEG placement through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME> using the suture pull-through method. This is easily possible with good diaphanoscopy. Then sterile washing and draping and initial removal of the left arm. Perform the neck dissection on the right side through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. To do this, incise the skin in the usual way. Expose the borders. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Showing the digastric muscle. Showing the cervical vascular sheath. Showing the hypoglossal and accessorius nerve. Exposure of the cervical sinus. Clearing of the neck levels IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Insertion of a Redon drainage and two-layer wound closure. Then tracheotomy performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. For this, vertical skin incision, exposure of the pretracheal musculature. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Dissection of the thyroid isthmus. Creation of a visor tracheotomy between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis. Then neck dissection on the left side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Incision in the usual manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and hypoglossus. Clearing of neck levels IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Then removal of the submandibular gland on the left side, which was already partially resected during the tumor resection and creation of a 3 QF wide tunnel to the inside of the mouth. Parallel to this, lift the radialis graft from the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>: mark the flap in the appropriate size and three-dimensional configuration, also in the direction of the pedicle. Then first lift the radial flap from the ulnar side and extend the incision cranially. Identification of the superficial venous system and the deep flap pedicle. Then recut the flap also from the radial side. This is done under constant pulse oximeter control, no special features here. The flap is also perfused. Then locate the pedicle. Deposition of the pedicle. This is treated distally and cranially with 4-0 Prolene puncture ligatures. The flap is then lifted along the pedicle in the typical manner, the outgoing vessels or outgoing vessels from the musculature are clipped successively. Dissection of the pedicle up to the crook of the elbow. Here the cephalic vein with 2 good outlets as well as a good confluence and the radial artery can be dissected. It can be seen that the radial artery graft is no longer perfused. Then puncture in the skin area. There is no blood flow and no detectable pulse signal in the area of the flap by Doppler sonography, only the proximal 2/3 of the flap stalk is still detectably perfused by Doppler sonography. The flap is then immediately warmed with warm cloths. As the flap still showed good perfusion in the proximal pedicle area, the decision was made to anastomose it arterially at the neck. Now anastomosis between the radial artery and the superior thyroid artery through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The thyroid artery showed very good blood flow. Unfortunately, even now there was no graft perfusion and there was also no vernal return flow. Especially spasm of the flap. As a last resort, the flap was placed in a solution of lidocaine, sodium bicarbonate and nitroglycerin and later sprayed again with nitrospray. When these measures proved ineffective, the decision was made to remove the flap and perform an endoscopy of the radial artery with a 0.8 mm endoscope from proximal and distal. Overall unclear situation. Explanation by the scar described by the patient, which was described as a superficial injury, not sufficient. Filiform openings are found at the upper entrance to the flap. In this case, anomaly of the vessel or consequence of an injury. A major trauma is not known from the anamnesis and was not described by the patient when asked. Nonetheless, there is evidence of insufficient flap perfusion at the upper border of the flap or at the upper edge of the flap where the artery enters. At the site of the filiform vascular drawings, the artery is now dissected out in the fatty tissue. It can also be seen here that the artery is lost in filiform, smaller vessel lumina. This means that the blood supply to the flap in this region is interrupted. The forearm is closed in a typical manner using split skin from the right thigh. Due to the defect, the only remaining option is to elevate the radial flap on the opposite side in order to cover the defect in an adequate, three-dimensional and areal dimension. Therefore, after covering the right side of the arm, lift the radialis flap from the right: Here too, after marking the flap, proceed in the same way as on the opposite side. As on the opposite side, a superficial venous system and the connection to the deep venous system as well as the deep vascular system of the flap pedicle can be visualized. Here too, first dissection from the ulnar, then from the radial side. Here too, the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve is preserved as on the opposite side. Separation of the flap distally with puncture ligation, as on the opposite side, and dissection cranially with supply of the outgoing vessels using clips or bipolar or ligature. At the end, 2 cephalic veins and a good radial artery. After removal of the flap, the veins are supplied with ligatures. The artery is supplied via puncture ligatures. Blood flow to the hand is always very good until the end with saturation values of 99 to 100 %. Very good blood supply to the flap. Ample irrigation of the flap pedicle with heparin solution. No special features here either. Subsequent closure of the forearm with split skin from the right thigh. The graft from the right side is regularly perfused and completely unremarkable. The graft is then removed, rinsed with heparin and prepared for insertion into the oropharynx. The tunnel must be widened slightly for this, as there is not yet sufficient visibility from the transcervical side into the defect. Suturing is almost impossible as the tongue and cheek area are extremely swollen and the patient already has a very small mouth opening. Therefore, the graft is first sutured to the soft palate and to the lateral wall of the oropharynx from the transoral side and the rest from the transcervical side in the area of the medial pharyngeal wall and around the base of the tongue. Then turn the graft over and suture in the area of the alveolar ridge and the floor of the mouth again from the transoral side. Then prepare the facial artery to attach the graft, which had already been ligated beforehand. The flow is very good. Anastomosis with the facial artery and a stump of the internal jugular vein to the deep flap vein and then anastomosis between the facial artery stump and the cephalic vein. Positioning of the pedicle. Fixation of the pedicle with Gelita. Insertion of a Penrose drain and two-layer wound closure, completion of the procedure. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Wait for histology and presentation of the patient at the tumor conference. A blue swallow can be performed clinically from the 10th postoperative day. An X-ray pre-swallow is not necessary.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy, PEG placement

The patient had again had swallowing problems for about six months and an exophytic tumor in the right hypopharyngeal-laryngeal region. Hence the indication for the above procedure.","Induction of anesthesia by anesthesia colleagues. Intubation by the anesthetist. First of all, entry with the small bore tube and inspection of the tumor region. An exophytic tumor is seen, starting in the tonsil loge on the right side, moving caudally, infiltrating the piriform sinus in the entrance area on the hypopharyngeal side wall. The tip of the piriform sinus is free, the tumor extends at the aryepiglottic fold onto the arytenoid cartilage on the right side. The endolarynx itself is free, but postradiogenically altered. Repositioning and placement of a PEG tube using the thread pull-through method. This is successful with good diaphanoscopy. No abnormalities in the esophagus and stomach area. Sterile washing and draping. Creation of an apron flap. However, this is only prepared up to the level of the hyoid bone in order to keep the neck opening as small as possible. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. This is very difficult on both sides as the patient has been pre-operated and pre-irradiated. The entire tissue is fibrotically altered and massively scarred. Skeletonization of the larynx with separation of the infrahyal musculature. Exposure of the hyoid bone. Detachment of the thyroid gland on both sides. Release of the piriform sinus on the left side. This cannot be done on the right side due to the tumor. Entering the pharynx on the right side. Disluxation of the epiglottis and inspection of the tumor region. The tumor appears as described above, starting at the tonsil lobe on the right side and extending caudally. First, release the laryngeal region from the pharynx on the right side. Cut around the tumor region with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm. The tumor extends to the esophageal entrance and can be placed there together with the laryngeal preparation. The specimen is thread-marked and sent for frozen section. The frozen section still shows parts of carcinoma in situ at the entrance to the oesophagus. A large resection specimen is taken here and another marginal specimen is taken for frozen section. Final R0 situation. Lifting the radial artery graft from the left. The radialis graft is 15x9 cm in size, as almost the entire pharynx has to be reconstructed. Only a narrow strip remained. Marking of the graft. Incision around the skin island and extension of the incision on the forearm. Depiction of the brachialis muscle. Exposure of the cephalic vein and other superficial veins. Exposure of the venous star in the crook of the elbow with exploration of the venous confluence between the superficial and deep venous system. Finding the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. This is divided into three branches. All three branches can be dissected and pushed laterally so that they do not have to be integrated into the graft. Locating the radial artery. Ligation and removal of the radial artery. Exposure of the tendons. Lifting the graft from the tendons. It is clear that the radial artery is massively calcified and looks like a rigid calcareous tube in large parts. Despite this, the graft is well perfused throughout the entire preparation time and the hand is also monitored by pulse oximetry and is also completely perfused with over 90% oxygen saturation. The stem is prepared in the usual way. The graft is placed in the crook of the elbow so that two veins are present. One from the superficial system and one from the deep system. The graft is sutured into the pharynx, starting in the tonsil lobe, down to the esophageal entrance. The esophageal entrance is reconstructed using a pointed Z-plasty. This is achieved by advancing the sutures. A Provox prosthesis was previously inserted in the usual way using the pull-through method. The oesophagus is easily passable digitally, so that a myotomy is not necessary. Perform a myotomy in the area of the sternocleidomastoid on both sides. The superior thyroid artery is used for the anastomosis of the radial artery graft for the venous limb. This works without any problems. Use of a coupler for the venous anastomosis, once to the superior thyroid vein and once to a more caudal outlet vessel from the internal jugular vein. Reconstruction of the tracheostoma. Insertion of a flap on the anastomosis side and insertion of a Redon drainage on the opposite side. Two-layer wound closure. Insertion of a tracheostomy tube, suturing of a tracheostomy tube. Completion of the procedure without complications. A nasogastric tube was placed intraoperatively. Please take X-ray and swallow on the 12th postoperative day and, if necessary, build up a diet, antibiotics for 24 hours.","Resection, Laryngectomy, Free flap (Radial), Provox prosthesis

CT shows deep growth in the soft tissues, reaching the level of the hyoid bone and also the lateral left laryngeal skeleton, therefore the above-mentioned operation is indicated.","First of all, pharyngoscopy again after positioning the head: The exophytic tumor can be seen, which is massively located at the described site. Mucosa in the area of the arytenoid fold on the left and postcricoid area edematously thickened. Indication for surgery confirmed. Flap cover with platysmal flap or radial flap probable. Initially in further positioning of the patient. Injection of the corresponding surgical regions and sterile draping after skin disinfection of all regions relevant to the operation. Initially start with an apron flap, which is extended to the left latero-caudally in order to cover the defect with a platysmal flap if necessary. Lift this apron flap subplatysmally in the area of the platysma with underlying fatty tissue on the left side. The external jugular artery is ligated and taken along, paying particular attention to the venous outlets, especially connections to the external jugular vein, anterior jugular vein and facial vein. The apron flap is raised on both sides to the level of the submandibular gland or the level of the hyoid bone. Then neck dissection on the left: Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle anterior border and dissection of the fat lymph node package. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein. Exposure of the internal carotid artery, externa. Exposure of the vagus nerve border cord, accessorius nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Subsequent evacuation level II to V with visualization of the branches of the cervical plexus which are preserved as far as possible. Subsequent tumor resection via lateral pharyngotomy. Pushing the hypoglossal nerve cranially. Push off the cervical vascular sheath laterally, ligation of the lingual artery. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery and pushing the thyroid gland in the upper pole latero-caudally. Exposure of the pharyngeal tube. Tumor can be felt massively next to the thyroid cartilage or on the thyroid cartilage. Insertion next to the epiglottis. Expose the tumor successively, cut around the tumor with a safety margin of at least 1.5-2 cm on all sides. The lateral part of the aryepiglottic fold falls caudally to the piriform sinus, medially to the posterior pharyngeal wall and cranially to the beginning of the tonsillar lobe, in each case the entire diameter of the pharyngeal wall. The thyroid cartilage is resected paramedian to the left and just above the beginning of the cricoid cartilage. The specimen is removed and marked with sutures. Carcinoma in situ or small foci, in this case infiltrates, are still recognizable in 2 places in the area of the arytenoid fold and in the area of the base of the tongue to the posterior pharyngeal wall despite the wide resection distance. Therefore, resection of a strip of mucosa at least 1 cm wide from the base of the tongue over the posterior pharyngeal wall to the transition to the piriform sinus. The specimen is marked with sutures away from the tumor. Further resection with removal of the mucosa in the area of the aryepiglottic fold, also a good cm wide up to the entrance to the piriform sinus. Here too, suture markings remote from the tumor. In the frozen section now at most low to moderate grade dysplasia, no carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma. Therefore now R0 resection. Neck dissection is now performed on the right side. Here too, removal of levels II to IV as well as parts of 5. Exposure of the structures as on the opposite side. All structures are also preserved as far as possible, especially the vessels. Then tracheostoma creation: The infrahyoid muscles are cut caudally. The thyroid isthmus is then passed underneath, clamped, severed and supplied by means of puncture ligatures. Exposure of the trachea . Wide pedicled modified Björk flap. Epithelialization of this initially caudally. Re-intubation and insertion of an 8 mm Woodbridge tube. The radial flap is removed: After measuring the size of the defect, the flap size is just under 11 x just under 7 cm. Marking on the forearm. Curved skin incision up to the crook of the elbow. First release the flap from the ulnar side while protecting the ulnar artery. Flap elevation subfascially. Subsequent cranial exposure of the superficial vascular system, which remains intact. Subsequent incision of the radialis flap from radial, subfascial. Exposure and preservation of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. After clamping the radial artery, remove it caudally and ligate. Then lift the flap subfascially with the vascular pedicle. Smaller vessels are bipolarly coagulated or supplied with clips. A variation then becomes apparent in the further course. The radial artery runs under the pronator teres muscle a little further caudally into the brachial artery. The confluence runs under the muscle in the direction of the superficial venous system, which runs above the muscle to the crook of the elbow. Decision to separate the superficial venous system from the deep one after a good confluence could be visualized below the pronator teres muscle. A. radialis is visualized at the entrance to the A. brachialis; the A. interossea, which is first clamped off, is first removed. Saturation at 100 % in each case. Deposition of the interosseous artery. Separation of the brachial artery at the entrance to the brachial artery. Treatment of the site of detachment with 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Subsequent stable saturation in the forearm area. Subsequent removal of the confluence below the pronator teres muscle and removal of the superficial veins with 2 connection options with splitting of the cephalic vein. The veins are ligated cranially. Flap pedicle is flushed with heparin via the superficial deep vein system and via the artery and preserved. Subsequent closure of the forearm defect: A piece of split skin is removed from the thigh area, thickness 07 to 08 mm. The thigh area is treated with a hydrocolloid dressing. Split skin is successively worked into the skin defect. The cranial skin wound is closed in layers. Subsequent octenidine-Mepilex dressing. Loose cloud dressing. Loose absorbent cotton dressing on loosely inserted compresses. Then fit Cramer splint and fix splint with tape bandage. Saturation on the forearm or thumb area always at 100%. Subsequent suturing of the flap into the defect: Radialis flap is inserted into the defect in such a way that the flap stem can be passed through a tunnel underneath the infrahyoid muscles to the opposite side. Successive suturing of the flap into the defect using 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures without tension. Flap is sutured to the remaining thyroid cartilage or laterally to the remains of the previously resected hyoid bone on the left. The epiglottis is not included in the suture so that it remains mobile. Complete tension-free closure. The flap pedicle is then passed underneath the infrahyoid muscles to the opposite side. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery, which can be anastomosed with 9.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow and good venous return. The confluent vein is anastomosed to a facial vein with 2.5 couplers. Here too, after opening the clamps, good venous flow, positive smear phenomenon. Next, anastomosis of an outlet of the cephalic vein with the external jugular vein via 3.5 couplers. Here too, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The remaining outlet is treated close to the outlet using clips. Subsequent careful irrigation of all regions in the neck area. Hemostasis. Insertion of a Redon drain on both sides, guided on the right. Successive layer-by-layer skin closure with incision of the apron flap with epithelialization of the tracheostoma. The skin in the area of the pre-platysmal flap was somewhat livid during the operation and was therefore not used to cover the defect, but had recovered by the end of the operation. Overall, radial flap coverage was indicated due to the size of the defect. Finally, insertion of an 8 mm tracheal cannula, which is fixed with sutures. The procedure was completed without complications. Doppler signals and flap perfusion normal. Patient goes to intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please elevate to 30°. Heparin perfusor 500 E/hour which was started intraoperatively please continue postoperatively for 5 days. Regular checks of the flap via transoral inspection or Doppler signals according to the scheme. Antibiotics started intraoperatively should be continued postoperatively with Unacid for approx. 1 week. Overall hypopharyngeal carcinoma with invasion into the lateral laryngeal region. Therefore, in addition to the hyoid bone on the left, thyroid cartilage on the left was also resected. Overall, however, a larynx-preserving procedure was possible and defect coverage using a radial flap was indicated. Postoperative presentation in the interdisciplinary tumor conference according to the histological findings. Nutrition via the inserted PEG tube. On the 10th postoperative day, gruel swallowing and, if necessary, diet build-up. Due to the position of the tube and the resection, protracted dysphagia is to be expected, therefore early initiation of swallowing therapy or swallowing rehabilitation.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Free flap (Radial)

Then insertion of a tonsillectomy tube and inspection of the tumor region. A large, exophytic tumor mass was found, starting from the tonsil on the right side, passing over to the soft palate up to the uvula and the base of the tongue. Start with transoral tumor resection in the area of the soft palate with a safety margin of more than 1 cm. Then successive tumor resection including the entire anterior palatal arch and the largest part of the posterior palatal arch and a small part of the base of the tongue on the right side. The tumor must be resected far to the side so that fatty tissue from the neck is already visible in the lateral oropharyngeal side wall. However, there is still no fistula, but the border to the soft tissue of the neck can no longer be guaranteed. Due to the large extent of the tumor resection, the lack of a soft palate and the expected fistula laterally into the soft tissues of the neck, the decision was made to cover the defect with a radialis graft. Initially, the neck dissection was performed on the left side, as it was not possible to assess whether the internal jugular vein could really remain intact on the right side. For this purpose, the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland were exposed. Then exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, dissection of the internal jugular vein, which can be completely preserved. Then expose the facial nerve and the lingual nerve of the superior thyroid artery and release the neck preparation IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the internal jugular and facial veins. Exposure of the submandibular gland, removal of the submandibular gland. Dissection of the digastric muscle. Release of the neck preparation IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. There is also a very large lymph node conglomerate on this side, which extends from level II to level IV; this could be integrated into the neck preparation and removed without destroying the vessels and nerves. Parallel to the neck dissection on the left side, the radialis graft is lifted, here for marking the graft on the forearm, cutting around the graft and extending the skin incision into the elbow. Exposure of the venous star in the elbow, showing the superficial and deep venous system with dissection of the confluence. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Exposure of the radial artery, clamping and cutting of the radial artery under pulsoxymetric control. Here 100% saturation in the left hand. Lift the graft from the veins in the usual manner, then dissect the stem up to the elbow and place the graft, taking one superficial and one deep vein with it. The transoral suturing of the transplant in the oropharynx is then very difficult, as the tongue, the uvula and the entire mucous membrane in the pharynx are already very swollen. In some cases, the graft has to be sutured into the lower area via the oropharyngotomy performed during the neck dissection. Finally, it is possible to fit the graft without tension, so that it does not tear out in the soft palate area, then repositioning to perform the anastomosis. First preparation and preparation of the superior thyroid artery. However, it turns out that there is hardly sufficient flow in the superior thyroid artery and the entire vessel is far too small to anastomose. Then turn to the lingual artery. Same problem here. Then search for the laryngeal artery, which is surprisingly relatively large and also has sufficient blood flow. Therefore, use the laryngeal artery to perform the anastomosis in the arterial area and then perform the venous anastomosis with an accompanying vein of the facial vein and the facial vein itself. The blood supply to the graft is good. Then insertion of a flap on the right side and insertion of a Redon drainage on the left side and two-layer wound closure. A tracheotomy was performed beforehand in the usual manner. This involved cutting the thyroid isthmus and performing a visor tracheotomy without a Björk flap between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage, creating a mucocutaneous anastomosis and reintubation with a tracheostomy tube. Continue antibiotics for 24 hours. The patient goes to the intensive care unit overnight and is allowed to wake up the next morning. Then nutrition via the existing PEG tube for 10 days, followed by an x-ray and food preparation.","Tumor resection, Modified radical neck dissection bilateral, Defect coverage (Radial), Tracheotomy

CT showed uncertain demarcation towards the paraglottic space. Sonography showed a cN2a neck status on the left.,"First, a pharyngo/laryngoscopy was performed. The exophytic tumor described above can be seen mainly in the area of the left fold, dorsal free ary, the tumor moves anteriorly to the laryngeal epglottis and from here circumscribed to the left fold. The vocal fold level itself is free. Growth just in front of the anterior commissure. If the tumor can be easily adjusted and palpated and is easy to move, laser resection is indicated. This is now performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The tumor is now successively excised from cranial to caudal. Beginning in the area of the laryngeal epiglottis, removal of the caudal epiglottis with removal of circumscribed pre-epiglottic fat. Resection of the tumor in several fragments to obtain an overview. Resection of the laryngeal part of the epiglottis. Now resection of the right pocket fold partially followed by resection of the complete left pocket fold, resection anterior to just above the anterior commissure. Macroscopic resection of the tumor clearly within the healthy tissue, safe conditions on all sides in depth during laser resection. Representative samples are now taken in the area of the supraglottis, the anterior commissure and the epiglottis. These are assessed as tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Finally, dry wound conditions. Now turn to neck dissection on both sides: start with the right side. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. Skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and auricular nerve. Dissection of the transversus colli nerve. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the facial vein. Preservation of the facial vein and visualization of the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation while sparing the superior thyroid artery, the cervical artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Several lymph nodes measuring up to 1.5 cm, but not macroscopically suspicious, are visible in the area of the jugulo-facial angle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the cervical and caudal plexus without evidence of lymph leakage. Final wound inspection. Wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and turning to the opposite side. Same procedure here in principle. Injection of xylocaine with added adrenaline. Incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cutting through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Creation of a platysmal flap. Exposure of the auricularis magnus nerve. An external jugular vein is not pronounced here. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A coarse mass measuring approx. 4 x 3 cm can now be easily palpated in levels II to III, which is still relatively easy to move, therefore the standard procedure continues. Dissection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exclusion of an infiltration. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digasatric muscle. Visualization of the facial vein, which runs directly towards the metastasis, which is located cranial to the jugulofacial angle. Therefore, the facial vein is removed. Clearing out the anterior neck preparation while exposing and protecting the superior artery. The cervical artery moves directly towards the metastasis and is taken along. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Subsequent free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Successive detachment from the metastasis. Exposure and dissection of the common carotid artery. The metastasis is directly overlying here, but is still separated from it by a broad layer of connective tissue. The metastasis extends as far as the hypoglossal nerve, but certainly does not infiltrate it. After free preparation of the internal jugular vein from the perivascular tissue, the metastasis can also be easily separated here. Overall, no evidence of perinodal growth, well encapsulated mass, furthermore several lymph nodes measuring up to approx. 2 cm in level II and III that are not necessarily suspicious. After complete visualization of the accessorius nerve, evacuation of the accessorius triangle and evacuation of level V with careful protection of the plexus branches and final check for lymph leakage. Subsequently dry conditions. Now a new discussion of the findings with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Plastic tracheostomy is now recommended, but no further measures are taken. Therefore, after wound irrigation of the left side, final wound inspection of both sides of the neck, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drainage tube and careful two-layer wound closure. The tracheotomy was then performed. To do this, make a horizontal skin incision below the cricoid cartilage and cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature, ligation of the anterior right jugular vein, exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea, the thyroid isthmus is relatively weak here and is coagulated in a bipolar fashion. Further visualization of the anterior surface of the trachea. Entry between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap, smoothing of the tracheostoma edges with the conchotome and subsequent suturing of the tracheostoma and subsequent problem-free reintubation on an 8 mm tracheoflex cannula. Finally, enoral wound inspection with the Kleinsasser tube. Here the wound conditions were clear with moderate glottic edema. Dry conditions on all sides, so the procedure was ended at this point. Conclusion: This was a cT2 cN2a G2 supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma on the left, which was resected intraoperatively R0 in conjunction with the resection and the representative marginal samples. Due to the clear lymph node metastasis, adjuvant therapy is certainly indicated postoperatively. Postoperative abstinence from food for at least 3 days, after which the patient can be given a liquid diet depending on swallowing function and, depending on the development of swallowing function, can be decannulated during the inpatient stay. The patient received intraoperative single-shot antibiotics with Unacid 3 g and a single dose of 250 mg SDH.","Neck dissection and laser resection

The accessorius nerve is now exposed and spared. The accessor nerve is followed further cranially and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle is now also visible. Further medially, the submandibular gland can be seen, which is also easily visualized. The omohyoid muscle can be seen caudally. This shows the borders of the neck dissection. The cervical vascular sheath is visible in the depth below the neck preparation. The internal jugular vein is exposed from caudal to cranial. There is no injury to the structures here. The superior thyroid vein and facial vein are dissected and spared. Medial to the jugular vein, the common carotid artery, the external carotid artery, the vagus nerve and the cervical artery are exposed. The neck preparation is now detached in level II b. Level II a follows, sparing the accessorius nerve. Levels III/IV and V are also detached without difficulty. The plexus branches are visualized and specifically spared. No chyle fistula occurs caudally when the neck preparation is removed. The anterior neck preparation is now also exposed and dissected along the facial vein and the superior thyroid vein. Clinical cN0 neck status. The tumor is now resected from the transcervical area, but half of the hyoid bone must also be resected. The tumor is incised around the edge of the tongue, then in the base of the tongue, then dislocated cervically and the rest is dissected out here. The tumor is placed on a cork and then cut out as a whole. All edges are tumor-free. Moderate dysplasia at the base of the tongue. This is resected again with a corresponding margin sample. Both are sent for final histology. Then measurement of the defect and preparation of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. In the meantime, dissection of the vessels on the right side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. There is a well-branched facial vein and a slightly deeper outlet from the internal jugular vein that is well suited for venous vascular connection. The superior thyroid artery is then dissected, which could serve as an arterial vascular connection. Enter with the flexible gastroesophagoscope and insertion of the PEG through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Entering with the gastroesophagoscope and, with air insufflation, pre-scanning into the stomach. Once in the stomach, endoscopy of the cardia after inversion of the endoscope. A spontaneous diaphanoscopy is now seen. A PEG is now placed in loco typico on the left paramedian anterior wall of the stomach using the suture pull-through method. This was performed without any problems. The patient received Unacid 3 g i.v. perioperatively. Measurement of the defect and the three-dimensional configuration. The resulting flap size is 14-15 x 10 cm, with one end becoming two-cornered. Now radial flap elevation. Mark the flap on the left forearm. Then first make an ulnar incision and extend the incision in the crook of the elbow. Elevation of the flap from the ulnar side. Then expose the superficial venous system and the connection to the deep venous system. Two cephalic veins can be dissected first. Cut around the flap radially. This is lifted subfascially as well as ulnarly, leaving tissue on the fascia. The lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve is exposed and preserved. The radial artery is then exposed. After adequate clamping time, whereby the saturation here was constantly at 100 %, this is removed, cut and treated using 4.0 prolene sutures. Lift the flap subfascially along the pedicle. This must be separated by the brachioradialis muscle. Smaller vessels are clipped or supplied with bipolar. A confluence with two larger ends is also prepared in the area where the radial artery enters the brachial artery. This is removed, theoretically leaving two ends for the anastomosis. The veins are then removed and ligated proximally. The artery is removed and treated using 6.0 Vascufil single-button sutures. Removal of the flap and irrigation with heparin solution. A piece of split skin measuring 15 x 7 cm is easily removed from the right thigh using the dermatome. Due to the size of the defect, after demonstrating the findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>, another piece of skin is removed, measuring 8 x 8 cm from the thigh ............laterally. This is done without any problems. Dressing with starch powder and Mepilex. Suture the flap into the defect. The flap is successively sutured into the defect, sometimes with sutures. This is achieved without tension. Prior to this, infrahyoid muscles were pedicled at the left superior thyroid artery and lifted and mobilized as a Remmert flap while preserving the innervation as far as possible. After soft tissue preparation, the pedicle is pulled through under the mobilized Remmert flap and inserted into the right side of the neck. Here, the artery and three veins of the flap are conditioned first, a confluent vein and the two cephalic veins. The superior thyroid artery is then conditioned. This is incised slightly so that the lumen fits better with the lumen of the radial artery. Suturing using 8.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, very good arterial flow and good venous return. Conditioning of the veins. The thyroid vein is removed with two ends. The proximal ends are clipped. The two ends are each anastomosed with the confluent vein or one end of the cephalic veins with a 2.5 mm coupler after appropriate conditioning. After opening the clamps, good venous flow, positive smear phenomenon. The facial vein is then prepared. A small outlet is selected for the anastomosis with the second cephalic vein. This is also done using a 2.0 coupler. Here too, after opening the clamps, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The proximal end of the facial artery is first clipped and then ligated. Careful irrigation of the entire wound area and hemostasis are now performed. The Remmert flap is now inserted into the former tongue base area on the pedicle to create volume augmentation and fixed in place using several 3.0 Vicryl single button sutures. Subsequent irrigation and hemostasis. Inspection of the flap enorally, it is vital and well supplied with blood. The wound is now closed in layers, with insertion of a Redon drain on the left and two flaps on the right and epithelialization of the already created tracheostoma. For this purpose, the laryngectomy tube is removed and the size 8 tracheostomy tube is inserted and then fixed in place using sutures. A suture is placed on the right above the vascular pedicle at skin level to facilitate blood flow by means of Doppler monitoring. Inspection of the flap again. This is vital. The procedure is then completed without complications. The patient is ventilated and transferred to the intensive care unit. Please continue the intraoperative antibiotic treatment with Unacid for one week. Flap control according to the scheme for 5 days, clinically and by means of Doppler control every 2 hours. Nutrition via PEG tube for at least 10 days. Then X-ray pre-swallow and, if necessary, diet build-up. Overall cT3-4 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left with cN2c status.

To do this, enter with 0° optics under laryngoscopic control. The subglottic region and the trachea are revealed. Subsequently intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Subsequent entry with the small bore tube under dental protection after inspection of the inconspicuous oral vestibule. First inspection of the oropharynx. This is symmetrical and clear. The base of the tongue itself is clear on both sides, as are the lateral walls of the pharynx and the vallecula. Inspection of the hypopharynx, which is clear up to the tips of the piriform sinus and the entrance to the esophagus, and the endolarynx is also inconspicuous. Then perform the flexible esophagogastroscopy. To do this, enter with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy to see through to the stomach. This is inconspicuous and clear. The oesophagus is also inconspicuous on reflection. Subsequent exploration of the oral cavity. There is an exophytic, exulcerated mass on the right edge of the tongue, extending from the anterior third to the posterior third. The exulcerated part measures approx. 2 x 1 cm, but with extensive submucosal growth. In this case, the total extension is at least 4 cm in length and at least 1.5 cm deep infiltration. The tumor is cut around with an electric knife with a safety margin of 2 cm. An extensive soft tissue mantle is also left on all sides of the tumor in the area of the musculature. Ligation of stronger vessels from the lingual artery and stronger veins, otherwise hemostasis by coagulation and removal of the tumor macroscopically clearly in sano. The specimen is completely suture-marked for urgent definitive histology. Wound irrigation and, with absolutely dry wound conditions, completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperatively, macroscopically extensively resected, submucosally very aggressively growing tongue margin carcinoma. A neck dissection on both sides with defect reconstruction, most likely using an anterolateral thigh graft, should be planned as soon as possible.

In our disciplinary tumor conference, the indication for primary surgical treatment was made.","After induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesiology colleagues and anesthesiological preparation, the primary tumor area was inspected again. This revealed an extensive mass in the area of the soft palate with a completely tumor-infiltrated uvula, extensive infiltration of the soft palate with significant submucosal infiltration. The tumor reaches the upper tonsillar lobe on the right side, also just on the left side. Overall transverse diameter of the tumor over 4 cm, therefore T3 extension. No tumor growth beyond the tonsillar lobe to the caudal side. PEG tube inserted first. Here, insertion with the gastroscope, under laryngoscopic control, easy advancement into the stomach. If diaphanoscopy is good, the stomach is punctured without any problems and the PEG tube is inserted using the usual suture pull-through method. Subsequent repositioning of the patient with preparation for microvascular defect reconstruction. First turn to tumor resection. For this purpose, the tumor is resected with a safety margin of a good 1 cm with consecutive subtotal soft palate resection. Tonsillectomy is performed if the tumor has spread to the upper pole of the tonsil on both sides. For a better overview, the anterior palatal arch is removed on both sides. The tonsil capsules on both sides are regular, on the left side circumscribed transition to the posterior palatal arch. Generous resection here too. The back of the soft palate can now be explored. Tumor growth towards the submucosa, but no mucosal infiltration. Successive development of the tumor and resection of the tumor macroscopically in toto. Removal of the soft palate and both tonsil lobes. In the submucosal preparation, a slightly narrower approach to the tumor capsule is seen in the area of the soft palate on the right side, which is why a complete definitive resection is performed here. All margins are then covered with margin samples, all of which are assessed as tumor-free. An R0 resection can therefore be assumed here. The tumor and the resected margin are sent for definitive histology. The graft required to cover both tonsil boxes and to restore the soft palate is now measured. The graft measures a total of 13 x 6.5 cm. The neck dissection and radialis graft removal are now performed in parallel to the neck dissection. Start with the right side. Make a curved skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Expose and cut through the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, exposure of the submandibular gland, exposure of the digastric muscle. Removal of the neck preparation with careful protection of the facial vein, the superior thyroid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Overall, due to the patient's anatomy and the somewhat varied course of the vessels, the preparation conditions were considerably more difficult. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, dissection of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve and dissection of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Level Ib is then evacuated with extirpation of the submandibular gland. This is followed by resection of the digastric muscle and a pharyngotomy measuring approx. 2 ˝ QF to position the pedicle. Overall, several nodules in the neck area, conspicuous in size and number, without infiltration of neighboring structures. In principle, the same procedure was used on the left side. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Ligation of very strong superficial veins with drainage into the anterior jugular vein and external jugular vein. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with preservation of a deep facial vein branch, a superficial facial branch is removed. Exposure and preservation of the superior thyroid artery and hypoglossal nerve. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Numerous lymph nodes can be seen in the area of the very deep vein angle. Macroscopically highly visible nodus measuring approx. 3.5 cm. Careful dissection of the accessorius nerve, but this can be preserved. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful preservation of the nerve and clearing of level V with careful preservation of the cervical plexus branches. Subsequently skeletonize the submandibular gland and evacuate level Ib while carefully protecting the oral branch. Careful wound inspection and palpation, followed by wound irrigation with H202 and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. At the same time, the radialis graft was harvested from the left forearm. After marking the graft, the tourniquet was applied. Cutting around the graft. Radial exploration of the cephalic vein. Perform the Haydn maneuver to identify the superficial ramus, radial nerve. Locate the distal vascular pedicle. Dissection after ligation. Ulnar dissection with exposure and visualization of the flexo carpi ulnaris. Complete detachment of the graft by strict subfascial dissection, proximal dissection of the pedicle including the drainage area of the cephalic vein. Careful clipping of outgoing veins in the antecubital fossa. Exposure of the extremely strong bridge of the radial veins into the cubital veins, including the cephalic vein. Positioning of the venous system to the side and exposure of the radial artery with securing of the outlet of the ulnar artery, reopening of the tourniquet. Careful, meticulous hemostasis with a regular graft. After removal of the graft, the wound is carefully closed in two layers in the forearm area and the full-thickness skin graft harvested from the groin is inserted. The vacuum sealing pump is then applied and the Cramer splint is placed in the functional position. For full-thickness skin harvesting from the right groin, incision of a full-thickness skin graft measuring approx. 14 x 6 cm, strictly cutaneous elevation. Subcutaneous mobilization, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain after careful wound inspection and hemostasis. Subsequent strong two-layer wound closure. The radialis graft is now inserted. Successive insertion with significantly more difficult insertion conditions due to the swelling that has now occurred and the rather strong radialis graft, successive insertion. Finally, good reconstruction of the soft palate with the graft still in place. Careful cervical stem displacement. Cervical preparation of the right side of the facial vein and the superior thyroid artery. The facial artery is also prepared. This is followed by anastomosis with the superior thyroid artery due to a jump in the caliber of the suture. After initially regular flow, there is now a lack of venous flow. Cessation of pedicle pulsation, therefore reopening of the artery in case of occlusion. Due to the rather unfavorable caliber conditions, preparation of the facial artery and renewed arterial anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. This now works well. Immediate regular venous return and excellent graft perfusion so that venous anastomosis with the coupler system is performed after preparation of the flap vein and the facial vein. After measuring a size 3.5 coupler, anastomosis is performed without any problems. Subsequent regular graft perfusion. Careful cervical wound inspection, wound irrigation and subsequent insertion of a guided 10 Redon drainage and careful two-layer wound closure. Due to the significant swelling that has now set in, a plastic tracheostomy is then performed. A horizontal incision is made at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Ligation of superficially pronounced veins. Dissection of the infrahyoid muscles. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the very deep trachea. Exposure and transection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. This shows a clear ........ or ossification of the trachea. Entry between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Somewhat laborious creation of a broad-based Björk flap with clear ossifications in the area of the tracheal clasps. Subsequent insertion of the tracheostoma with generally difficult insertion conditions due to the cartilage conditions. Subsequently, problem-free reintubation to a size 9 low cuff cannula and, after final enoral inspection with a vital graft, termination of the procedure at this point. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT3 cN2c soft palate carcinoma. Reconstruction using a radialis graft. Due to the initial graft swelling and the more difficult adaptation conditions, the patient should not be given food until the 10th postoperative day. With proper graft healing and swallowing function, timely closure of the tracheostoma should be possible.","Pharyngectomy, Neck dissection, Defect reconstruction, Free flap (Radial)

Entry with the small bore tube under dental protection. Inconspicuous oral cavity and oropharynx. The base of the tongue and vallecula are also clear, as is the epiglottis. An exophytic, endolaryngeal tumor growth with complete displacement of the glottis or glottic entrance is now visible. However, the tumor does not exceed the aryepiglottic folds on both sides or the arytenoid region. Completely free hypopharynx, which can be visualized as far as the piriform sinus tips and the esophageal entrance. Insertion of a nasogastric feeding tube under visualization. The patient is then positioned and xylocaine with adrenaline is injected. The exophytic tumor growth is completely incised with a safety margin. Widening of the skin incision to lift an apron flap. Subplatysmal flap elevation is then performed first. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. All structures not infiltrated. Exposure of both sides of the internal jugular vein and facial vein. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery on both sides and the thyroid gland. Caudal visualization of the trachea. This is free of tumors caudally. If the tumor is externally on the right side, it can now be seen in depth on the left side. Paratracheal thyroid infiltration on the left. Paratracheal therefore subtotal thyroid resection, the vagus nerve is caudally caked into the conglomerate and is resected caudally. Right-sided circumscribed partial thyroidectomy, here with preservation of the superior thyroid artery on the left side. Ligation of the artery. Several lymph nodes conspicuous in number and size on both sides, but without definite malignancy criteria or perinodal growth. Clearing of level II to IV on both sides. Now visualization of the hyoid. Skeletonization of the larynx. Complete caudal exposure of the trachea. Entry into the trachea with resection of 2 tracheal clips, here macroscopically tumor-free externally. Complete mobilization of the larynx and the caudal tumour conglomerate. Entry pharyngeally at the level of the vallecula. Mucosa-sparing release of the epiglottis. Resection along the aryepiglottic fold with a safety margin of approx. 1.5 cm, also in the postcricoid region. Release the laryngeal skeleton while carefully protecting the esophagus. Performing the myotomy in the area of the upper esophageal sphincter and caudally in the area of the trachea to remove the larynx and the tumor in toto. On the left paratracheal side, there was a suspicious mass in the form of a lividly discolored, suspicious lymph node, corresponding to the CT diagnosis. Inspection of the specimen showed both the laryngeal tumor portion and the subglottic portion resected in sano on all sides with a safety margin of a good 1 cm. Somewhat unclear tissue changes or conspicuous changes in the caudal musculature. For this reason, a complete soft tissue margin sample was taken here, as well as imaging with margin samples of the entire tumor in the area of the mucosa and in the area of the tracheal abscess margin. Complete imaging of the skin resectate beforehand. All samples are diagnosed as completely tumor-free, meaning that an R0 resection has been achieved. The size of the defect is now measured, a skin defect measuring 11 x 7 cm in total. An anterolateral thigh graft is then harvested from the right. After marking the landmarks and doppler sonographic identification of the skin perforator and a strong secondary perforator, mark a spindle-shaped graft measuring approx. 12.5 x 7.5 cm. Medial incision. Exposure and securing of the rectus femoris muscle. Strictly subfascial preparation. Exposure of the perforators and the vascular pedicle. Performing the extension incision. Dissection of the vascular pedicle and release in the area of the intermedius muscle. A superficial musculocutaneous perforator course can be seen. Caudal removal of the vascular pedicle and elevation of the graft, taking the fascia lata with it. Inclusion of a narrow muscle cuff in the area of the perforators. Conditioning of the vessels and, if the graft is vital, removal of the graft. Careful wound inspection and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful, two-layer wound closure. The graft is now inserted, initially tracheally. If the trachea is clearly set off caudally, there will be slightly increased tension even after mobilization, especially in the pectoral skin area. Here, mobilization of the skin as far as possible and insertion of the trachea anteriorly as described above under increased tension conditions. Later, successive insertion of the tracheostoma primarily through the graft. Microvascular anastomosis is then performed on the right side. Conditioning of the lingual artery. Perform the arterial anastomosis with 8-0 Ethilon; this is successful and sufficient. Immediate regular venous return via primarily one flap vein, therefore occlusion of the 2nd vein. Conditioning of the facial vein. Perform the venous anastomosis with the coupler system size 3.0, followed by regular pedicle perfusion, positive smear test and regular flap perfusion. Then complete incorporation of the graft after checking all wound regions. In the case of dry wound conditions, insertion of a 10 Redon drain here. Subsequently, careful, two-layer wound closure with fitting of the graft. Finally, with a vital graft and fully incorporated tracheostoma, reintubation to a size 10 low cuff cannula and completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected, extensive cT4a cN+ laryngeal carcinoma with extensive peristomal spread. Postoperatively, please continue the intraoperatively started intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g for 24 hours. If the wound is healing properly, perform an X-ray gruel on the 10th postoperative day. Special wound observation in the area of the tracheostoma in case of difficult tissue conditions. If the wound is healing properly, rapid administration of the urgently required adjuvant therapy.

The PET-CT shows a flat asymmetry of the enhancement in the area of the tonsil on the left more than on the right. In the ENT mirror findings, the left tonsil can be palpated discretely harder than the right, otherwise no suspicious mass. Based on the medical history and clinical findings, indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","First, transfer the patient to the operating theater. Then active patient identification and team time out. Consultation with the anesthesia department. Then induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues. Then head positioning by the surgeon and insertion of the Mc Ivor mouth spatula, taking into account the teeth, lips and tongue. Repeated inspection and palpation of the base of the tongue and tonsils. Only the left tonsil is found to be discreetly hardened, otherwise there is no suspicious mass, either by inspection or palpation. Tonsillectomy on the right side first. To do this, grasp the upper pole of the tonsil and dislodge it. Then make a parauvular mucosal incision and extend it caudally. Successive dissection along the tonsil capsule from the upper pole to the lower pole using raspa and scissors. Occasional bipolar coagulation. Separation of the tonsil at the lower pole after extensive bipolar coagulation. Inspection of the wound bed using an angled mirror. Isolated bipolar coagulation at the lower tonsil pole, then no further bleeding here. Isolated bleeding at the upper tonsil pole, also here biopolar coagulation, then no further bleeding. Insertion of hydrogen swabs on the right side and turning to the left side. Here too, grasp the tonsil at the upper pole and dislodge it. This is somewhat more difficult than on the opposite side. Parauvular mucosal incision and extension of the same with an approx. 0.5 cm wide margin. Now dissect the upper pole of the tonsil capsule. After a short time, it becomes apparent that this is more difficult and the upper tonsil pole appears to be cemented to the base. Demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Further tonsillectomy on the left using scissors and raspa. In the lower third, the preparation is much more successful, in the upper third an attempt was made to resect the adhesions and hardening completely in toto. The tonsil is easily removed at the lower pole after extensive bipolar coagulation. Then hemostasis at the lower tonsil pole. Only occasional focal hemostasis at the upper tonsil pole. The tonsil is suture-marked for frozen section. Long long upper cranial tonsillar pole, short long lateral tonsillar margin and short short dorsal cranial tonsillar pole. The right tonsil also goes to the frozen section. The right tonsil is free of carcinoma. On the left tonsil, there is basaloid squamous cell carcinoma at the cranial tonsillar pole up to the medial margin, matching the lymph node metastasis. The lateral tonsil margin and the dorsal cranial tonsil pole were free. Subsequent demonstration of findings at <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Subsequent resection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First, a posterior resection is performed on the posterior palatal arch medially and a posterior resection on the anterior palatal arch laterally and at the base of the wound caudally. These resections are sent for final histology. Subsequently, marginal samples are taken and sent for frozen section, namely the medial posterior palatal arch, lateral anterior palatal arch and cranial anterior palatal arch. In addition, the cranial wound bed and caudal wound bed as well as the caudal margin. The frozen section also shows squamous cell carcinoma on the posterior palatal arch medially and, according to the pathologist, a carcinoma in situ in the cranial wound bed and non-assessable tissue in the caudal wound bed. For this reason, <CLINICIAN_NAME> subsequently performs another extensive resection in all areas of the previous margin samples. A final marginal sample is therefore taken from the caudal wound bed, a second resection is performed in the cranial wound bed, a final marginal sample is taken from the cranial wound bed, a second resection is performed on the medial posterior palatal arch and, last but not least, a final marginal sample is taken from the medial posterior palate. The areas of the previously described R1 resection are thus covered and a macroscopic R0 situation is present, resulting in the prolapse of fatty tissue at the lateral tonsillar margin, which is coagulated. However, there is no fistula in the direction of the neck. The posterior palatal arch is ultimately only marginally protruding. An adapting suture is placed in the area of the soft palate. The samples are now sent for final histology. Hemostasis is performed. No further signs of bleeding here. Unblocking after sufficient waiting time. Repeated inspection. No further bleeding here. A nasogastric tube is inserted and its position checked. Air can be auscultated in the stomach and gastric juice aspirated. Now turn to neck dissection on the left: The surgeon first positions the head. Then infiltration anesthesia with 6 ml Ultracaine 2% in the area of the planned incision. Then skin disinfection and sterile draping of the surgical area. Now mark the skin incision, which curves along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid, and mark landmarks on the mastoid, mandible and jugulum. Now cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Then cut and expose the platysma. The external jugular vein is cut in the process. Then expose the sternocleidomastoid, the omohyoid, the submandibular gland and the anterior and posterior digaster venter. Subsequently, clearing of the anterior medial neck dissection specimen while sparing the facial vein, the superior thyroid artery, the hypoglossal nerve, the internal jugular vein and the cervical vein. Subsequent visualization of the accessorius nerve. Larger veins are ligated individually. Subsequent clearing of the accessory triangle. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and exposure of the external and internal carotid arteries and exposure of the vagus. Now clearing of the lateral neck triangle from level IV to level II with transition to level Va. Careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Subsequent wound irrigation with Ringer and wound inspection. Isolated bleeding here. These are stopped using bipolar coagulation. Now no further bleeding. Wound irrigation again. Now dry wound conditions. Subsequent insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Head repositioning by the surgeon and completion of the procedure without complications. Conclusion: suspected cT1 cN2b tonsillar carcinoma on the left. Neck dissection from level II to level Va and tumor tonsillectomy on the left. The first resection revealed focal squamous cell carcinoma on the posterior medial palatal arch as well as CIS in the cranial wound bed and non-assessable conditions in the caudal wound bed. For this reason, a second resection was performed with final margin samples, which were sent for final histology. In R0, the swallowing function should be awaited; if this does not appear sufficient, flap coverage is possible before adjuvant therapy. In the R1 situation, presentation at the tumor conference and planning of a subsequent resection with flap coverage and discussion of a contralateral neck dissection.

As this needs to be confirmed again, a test biopsy with a frozen section is performed on the ward before the start of surgery. <CLINICIAN_NAME> decides on squamous cell carcinoma.","Intraoperatively, before intubation, positioning of the laryngeal entrance with the laryngoscope. Entering with the 0 degree optics and endoscopy of the larynx and trachea. This is inconspicuous. The visible main bronchi are clear. After intubation, perform a microlaryngoscopy: adjust the small bore tube. Vocal folds, anterior/posterior commissure, supraglottic region inconspicuous. Pharyngoscopy: piriform sinus on both sides, postcricoid region, posterior pharyngeal wall, lateral pharyngeal walls and esophageal entrance clear. Finally, a flexible esophagoscopy was performed: the esophagoscope was easily advanced into the stomach. Inconspicuous conditions there. No evidence of a second tumor on retraction. Now adjusting the tonsil barring device. An exophytically growing tumor can be seen in the area of the right tonsil, which also extends anteriorly towards the base and edge of the tongue. Grasp the right tonsil with the grasping forceps and begin dissection at the cranial margin with scissors and monopolar coagulation. Dissection in the healthy tissue behind the tonsil. The posterior palatal arch is preserved. Further preparation towards the alveolar ridge and anteriorly towards the tongue. Part of the base of the tongue and the tongue are included. Sharp dissection here with monopolar coagulation. Finally, the tumor with the tonsil and parts of the tongue and the base of the tongue are completely incised and extirpated in toto. Circular margin samples are taken and sent for frozen section. These are found to be tumor-free. Overall, an R0 situation can be assumed for a cT2 tonsil/oropharyngeal carcinoma. After resection of the tumor, it can be seen that large parts of the submandibular gland are exposed. Individual injecting vessels were previously bipolarly coagulated and are now clipped again. Application of TachoSil. Consultation of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. It is decided not to perform a neck dissection at this time. This must be performed in 14 days after the wound has started to heal. The submandibular gland must be preserved for coverage. In addition, individual vascular stumps are treated with clips. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring and should remain there over the weekend. In the event of post-operative bleeding, tamponade directly in the tonsil lumen. This should be clinically feasible.","Tonsillectomy

Overall, the mass was partly necrotic and appeared liquid, measuring over 10 cm in total. The Kleinsasser tube was inserted under dental protection and the inconspicuous oral cavity and oropharynx were inspected. An uneven mucosa can now be seen at the entrance to the left piriform sinus, which merges into an ulcerated tumor in the area of the left piriform sinus. The uneven and partly slightly elevated mucosa moves to the posterior wall of the hypopharynx, just not reaching the midline and caudally free esophageal entrance. The tumor infiltrates the hemilarynx via the medial piriform sinus wall and breaks through it here and appears submucosally in the area of the pocket fold. The glottic plane itself and the subglottic region are exposed. The patient is now repositioned and prepared. Incision of the monstrous mass on the left cervical side with sufficient safety distance, completion of the incision to the right in the sense of an apron flap. Dissection of the healthy skin in the form of an apron flap. Detachment of the mass which broadly infiltrates and destroys the sternocleidomastoid muscle, also resection in case of infiltration of the omohyoid muscle. Caudal visualization of the cervical vascular sheath. The internal jugular vein can already be seen here with significantly reduced flow, with clear infiltration cranially. This is therefore removed. Exposure and preservation of the common carotid artery and vagus nerve. Cranially, the mass also infiltrates the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Sectional exposure of the ramus marginalis mandibulae. Removal of several small nodular lymph nodes. Extirpation of the gland with protection and exposure of the lingual nerve and ligation of the excretory duct. Complete resection of the cervical plexus branches, the accessorius nerve is also infiltrated. Separation of the internal jugular vein and the cranial sternocleidomastoid muscle. Now dissection of the carotid artery walled around the MCC at a good 180°. Further dissection reveals a clear infiltration of the vagus nerve. This is therefore resected. The hypoglossal nerve can be separated from the mass, here no infiltration. There is now an infiltration of the external carotid artery up to just before the bulb. The internal carotid artery is free. Separation of the external carotid artery close to the bulb and removal of a marginal sample. This is shown to be tumor-free in the frozen section diagnosis. Therefore, in sano resection of the carotid artery with an overall extensive surrounding wall and removal of the mass in toto which, however, is clearly inflammatory. Intraoperative drainage of serous fluid in the sense of extensive necrosis, overall vulnerable conditions. Subsequent right-sided release of the hemilarynx. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage....... Release of the right-sided piriform sinus. The left-sided resection of the hyoid was already performed during the metastasis resection. Now removal of the residual hyoid. Entering enorally at the level of the vallecula. Successive widening of the pharyngotomy sparingly along the right aryepiglottic fold. Now a good overview of the tumor. Incision of the tumor, which has clearly quieter mucosal extensions in the periphery with a safety margin of approx. 1.5 cm. Resection to just before the middle of the posterior hypopharyngeal wall. Deposition at the esophageal entrance. No more suspicious conditions here. The tumor is now completely covered with marginal samples in the mucosal area, the entire base is radically removed in the course of the neck dissection. The frozen section diagnosis now shows the invasive carcinoma R0 resected, circumscribed Cis in the area of the posterior hypopharyngeal wall. A resection is therefore performed here and a final marginal specimen removed, so that the overall situation is R0. Now to the harvesting of the antero-lateral thigh graft. After identification of the landmarks, doppler sonographic identification of the main perforator and 2 secondary perforators. Configuration of the graft to cover the pharyngeal defect due to the extensive hypopharyngeal resection in this case, as well as a skin defect measuring approx. 13 x 7 cm. A graft measuring a total of 27 x 8 cm was removed as a two-incision flap. Medial incision, separation of the extensive fat layer. Identification of the rectus femoris muscle. Subfascial release and exposure of the regularly configured pedicle vessel. Widening of the incision. Identification of the main perforator and two secondary perforators. Dissection of the perforators with circumscribed musculocutaneous course. Isolation on the perforators. Removal of the fascia lata to protect the perforators, otherwise it is left in place. Complete cutting of the graft. Isolation on the vascular pedicle and placement of the excellent vital graft after thinning out the lateral ends, paying careful attention to the vascular fat layer. Finally, vital graft and placement of the pedicle vessel. Subsequent insertion of 10 redon drains and careful multi-layer strong wound closure. <CLINICIAN_NAME> Neck dissection on the right: visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Then release of the neck preparation IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches; the internal jugular vein and the cervical vascular sheath were previously exposed. The superior thyroid, facial and lingual arteries were preserved, as was the facial vein. Insertion of the transplant. First, the graft is sutured into the hypopharynx with the smaller skin island. To do this, start at the base of the tongue and successively suture in the entire graft portion intended for the pharynx. This is successful without any problems. Then reposition and advance the microscope and dissect the arterial vessels using <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The connective tissue is removed from the superior thyroid artery and the facial artery. Ultimately, there is very good flow in the superior thyroid artery. This is flushed with xylocaine by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and temporarily clamped. The vascular anastomosis is then performed by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First suture the artery, this is successful without any problems. Dissection of the veins, the graft veins are extremely small and have many valves. It is therefore difficult to perform the venous anastomosis using a coupler. Finally, it is successful and the graft shows very good perfusion and also very good reperfusion. Then insertion of a Redon drain on the right side and a flap on the left side and fitting the second skin island of the graft first into the tracheostoma, then into the large skin defect on the neck.","Resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement, Defect coverage, Free flap (ALT)

The panendoscopy performed <2013> revealed a cT1b glottic laryngeal carcinoma on the right side. Decision to take the above measures.,"First, after induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues, a rigid tracheoscopy is performed using O° optics in the area of the trachea up to the carina. Subsequent problem-free endotracheal transoral intubation with a laser tube and positioning of the patient by the surgeon. Entry into the endolarynx with the Kleinsasser B-tube. An exophytic mass was found starting at the transition from the posterior to the middle third of the right vocal fold, affecting the entire vocal fold, reaching the anterior commissure and infiltrating the most anterior part of the left vocal fold via the midline. The supraglottis and subglottis were unremarkable. Thus, cT1b glottic laryngeal carcinoma on the right was emphasized. The remaining left vocal fold was unremarkable. With very good adjustability, decision to perform transoral microscopically controlled laser resection. Demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Setting the CO2 laser to continuous mode with a power of 6 watts. Focusing the laser beam and moving around the pre-existing mass from the posterior starting point under microscopic control of the safety distance. A circumscribed exposure of the thyroid cartilage occurs in the area of the anterior commissure. Circumventing the mass in the anterior third of the left vocal fold and depositing the tumor specimen which is sent in for final histology (short short posterior, short long superior towards the pocket fold, long long anterior towards the anterior commissure). Five marginal samples were then taken, posterior, superior towards the pocket fold, inferior towards the subglottic, anterior commissure, anterior left vocal fold. All marginal samples were sent for frozen section examination. According to the pathologists, all marginal samples were found to be tumor-free. Only in the inferior border sample in the subglottic direction and on the left vocal fold could no statement be made in the frozen section regarding the detection of dysplasia. In order to keep the glottic defect as small as possible and in view of the microscopically unremarkable subglottic region and left vocal fold anteriorly, post-resection was not performed and the final histology should be awaited.

Then marking and setting of the apron flap, whereby the tracheostoma is included in the apron flap. Dissection of the apron flap cranially to beyond the hyoid bone. Now start with the neck dissection on the right side. Here, regions II to V are removed while sparing all non-lymphatic structures. However, a lymph node metastasis can be seen around the internal jugular vein, which can just be dissected away from the vessel in a healthy layer macroscopically. Identification and dissection of the superior thyroid artery, which must be removed at the upper thyroid pole. Then dissection of the carotid artery, which is dissected laterally from the laryngeal skeleton. Then incision of the constrictor pharyngis muscle at the lateral edge of the thyroid cartilage and release of the piriform sinus on the right side as far as possible. On palpation, the tumor also appears to have partially grown into this area. Release of the lateral horn of the hyoid bone and separation of the suprahyoid muscles up to the middle. Then cut the straight muscles of the neck, pass under the thyroid isthmus and expose the anterior wall of the trachea up to the already existing tracheostoma. Then transition to the opposite side. Similar conditions here in principle. However, it can be seen that the left neck is in principle a single large metastasis extending from region IIa to region V. This is also macroscopically dissected in a healthy layer of the internal jugular vein, which lies medial and ventral to the metastasis. Resection of the metastasis en bloc reveals the brachial plexus. In addition, the phrenic nerve can now be seen to pass through the middle of the caudal metastasis, so that it must be removed. The metastasis is then developed retroclavicularly from the caudal side. This exposes the thoracic duct, which is also opened. It is then grasped and ligated. Finally, the metastasis can be completely removed from the caudal side. The site of the thoracic duct is also ligated so that no further lymphatic leakage can be seen clinically. Then dissection of the superior thyroid artery, which is extremely small in caliber. Therefore, dissection of the external carotid artery cranially and identification and dissection of the facial artery, which is deposited on the mandible and beaten caudally and later used for anastomosis. The suprahyoid muscles are now also removed here. The large tumor is palpable in the area of the lateral hyoid horn and the piriform sinus, so that no further manipulations are performed here. Now dissect the lingual side of the epiglottis up to its upper edge. Cut the pharyngeal mucosa at the upper edge of the epiglottis and enter the pharynx, initially to the right along the upper edge of the glottis. This reveals the tumor on the left. This occupies the entire left pharyngeal wall, spreads to the larynx, spreads endolaryngeally and has already infiltrated the right arytenoid. The tumor is then successively removed on both sides under visual control with an appropriate safety margin. The entire left pharyngeal wall is resected. The resection continues caudally into the esophageal orifice before it can be carried out on the opposite side so that the larynx can then be removed ventrally at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage. Circumferential mucosal margin sections are then taken from the remaining pharynx, all of which prove to be tumor-free. The small amount of muscle still present in the posterior pharyngeal wall on the left side is also biopsied in the form of marginal incisions, which also prove to be tumor-free. This leaves only a strip of mucosa approx. 2 1/2 to 3 cm wide on the posterior pharyngeal wall. A radial lobe graft was then removed from the left forearm, each 7 cm wide and 10 cm long. After placement of the radial lobe graft, it is sutured into the defect, with the stalk being diverted caudally. The radial artery is then anastomosed to the facial artery. Venous drainage takes place through 2 veins in the end-to-side internal mandibular artery. In the meantime, a 6 x 10 cm split-thickness skin graft is harvested from the right thigh and used to cover the left forearm. Finally, freshening of the tracheostoma by resection of the granulating altered skin. Folding back the apron flap and two-layer wound closure in the usual manner after applying Redon drains on both sides and a flap on the left in the area of the anastomosis. Re-intubation of the patient. Repeated check of the flap, which can be easily seen with a laryngoscope. End of the operation, transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Laryngo-pharyngectomy for large hypopharyngeal laryngeal carcinoma. Cervical metastasis on both sides and mainly on the left. Therefore resection of the phrenic nerve on the left as part of the metastasectomy. Very close relationship of the metastases to the internal jugular vein on both sides. Covering of the defect on the left forearm with split skin from the right thigh. Due to the caudal extension of the resection to the esophageal entrance, the insertion of a provox prosthesis was initially dispensed with, whereby the myotomy was already performed intraoperatively for a possible later secondary Blom-Singer puncture.","Laryngo-/Pharyngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection I-IV, Free flap (Radial)

A very superficially growing, slightly exophytic tumor with an uneven mucosal surface was found in the area of the vallecula. The tumor occupies the entire vallecula, passes centrally to the base of the tongue and extends over almost the entire surface of the lingual epiglottis as well as over the right edge of the epiglottis. Now first perform the PEG insertion. To do this, enter with the gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Pre-insufflation into the stomach without any problems under constant air insufflation. If conditions are normal and diaphanoscopy is good, puncture the stomach and insert the PEG tube using the usual thread pull-through method without any problems. No abnormalities in the area of the esophagus on reflection. Now enter with the Steiner tube and visualize the findings. Successive removal of the very superficially grown tumor with constant correction of the spreading tube. Under the microscope, it can be seen that a tumor cone is also moving across the aryepiglottic fold towards the anterior piriform sinus wall. The superficial tumor is removed in the area of the epiglottis with the mucosa on the cartilage. The free right epiglottis margin and parts of the aryepiglottic fold are removed. This results in a complete resection of the vallecula with partial resection of the base of the tongue and partial resection of the epiglottis. This is followed by a post-resection, which corresponds to the tumor cones in the direction of the piriform sinus anterior wall. Marginal samples are taken in the area of the left vallecula and the base of the tongue. Due to the extensive tumor growth and the sometimes clearly dysplastic mucosal conditions at the tumor extensions, no further marginal samples are taken. Finally, when the wound is dry, the tracheotomy is performed due to the large area of the wound. A T-shaped incision is made below the cricoid. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Expose the cricoid cartilage and carefully detach the thyroid isthmus, which is very thin here. Pronounced bipolar coagulation and separation of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the anterior tracheal wall and insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Now first perform the neck dissection on the left side. To do this, make a skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Creation of a platysmal flap. Exposure and preservation of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Exposure of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Exposure of the muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Numerous lymph nodes in the area of the venous angle and the accessorius triangle are already visible in the preliminary preparation. Now expose the omohyoid muscle. Trace the muscle and expose up to the hyoid. Expose the submandibular gland, taking the caudal gland capsule with it. Release in the direction of the hyoid. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Exposure of the facial vein. Now expose the cervical vein and in this layer release the anterior neck preparation while carefully preserving and exposing the superior thyroid artery as well as the vein and the hypoglossal nerve. Now free preparation of the vein while carefully protecting the lymph nodes lying on it. Cranial dissection up to the digaster, carefully protecting the accessorius, which runs over the vein and on which numerous nodes lie. In some cases very laborious dissection here, but no macroscopic lymph nodes exceeding the capsule. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V coming via the cervical sinus while carefully protecting the plexus branches. If the wound is finally dry, wound irrigation and two-layer wound closure after insertion of a 10 Redon drain. At the same time, perform the neck dissection on the right side. Here too, skin incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Separation of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A large lymph node conglomerate lying on the internal jugular vein can already be seen here. First visualization of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric nerve. Now successive exposure of the lymph node conglomerate, which lies broadly against the facial vein and the internal jugular vein. Particularly difficult dissection here. The mass is directly adjacent to the vein and can only be separated from it in a final layer with great effort. Meticulous dissection is also required in the area of the nevus accessorius. Here, too, the mass is in direct contact with the vein. However, all the structures mentioned could be preserved. Separation of the mass. Then completion of the neck dissection. Successive clearing of level V with careful protection of the plexus branches. Similarly, complete anteriorly. Clearing out here, also protecting the hypoglossal nerve and the superior thyroid artery. If the wound is finally dry, final inspection and wound irrigation and, after insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure, completion of the procedure after final reintubation on an 8-gauge low-cuff cannula without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Neck dissection performed on the right side at the same time. Here too, skin incision at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Separation of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A large lymph node conglomerate lying on the internal jugular vein can already be seen here. First visualization of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric nerve. Now successive exposure of the lymph node conglomerate, which lies broadly against the facial vein and the internal jugular vein. Particularly difficult dissection here. The mass is directly adjacent to the vein and can only be separated from it with great effort in a final layer meticulous Extensive vallecula carcinoma with cN2c neck status on the right side. Pronounced lymph node conglomerate in the area of the accessorius triangle and the venous angle, which was removed with considerable effort by a functional neck dissection. Due to the very superficial tumor growth and the broad extension as well as the expected further dysplastic mucosal conditions in the head and neck area and the adjuvant therapy that was certainly indicated, the tumor resection was performed without extensive covering of the marginal specimens. Treatment with tracheal cannula depending on postoperative swallowing function.  ","Laser resection of Vallecula cancer, Functional bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, PEG placement

With an initial suspected diagnosis of CUP syndrome, a cT1 hypopharyngeal carcinoma was histologically confirmed as the primary tumor during a panendoscopy. In addition to unclear esophageal changes, clarification by our colleagues in Medicine 1 revealed a CIS 24 cm from the tooth row with additional unclear lung findings. In our interdisciplinary tumor conference, it was decided that the primary surgical treatment of the hypopharyngeal carcinoma would be re-evaluation and, if necessary, endoscopic resection of the esophageal findings and monitoring of the lung findings.","After induction and intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, the patient is first positioned. Repeat pharyngo-/laryngoscopy: For this purpose, enter with the Kleinsasser tube under dental protection. With an unremarkable oral cavity and oropharynx as well as an unremarkable endolarynx, the exophytic tumor can be seen in the right-sided postcricoid region, as described above, measuring approx. 2 cm and still well mobile at the mucosal level without submucosal infiltration of the thyroid cartilage or the arytenoid joints. The rest of the hypopharynx is free up to the tips of the piriform sinus and the esophageal opening. The dental guard, the lip retractor and the FK blocker are now inserted. Difficult, but ultimately regular adjustability of the tumor with good exposure of the postcricoid region. Successive resection of the tumor with the monopolar. Resection while sparing the cartilaginous bony structure. The tumor is sent for definitive histology. Removal of representative marginal samples. These are shown to be completely tumor-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Therefore, after careful wound inspection and hemostasis, a nasogastric feeding tube is initially inserted if the endolaryngeal conditions are narrow and a tracheotomy is not performed if the conditions are narrow. Rearrangement for neck dissection: palpation reveals a rough and barely displaceable paralaryngeal mass. Injection of xylocaine with adrenaline. Incision of the old scar. Cutting of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Subcutaneous extensive scarring. Cutting through the remains of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is broadly infiltrated from the underside, therefore first exposing the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle caudally. Separation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and preservation of the external jugular vein. The omohyoid muscle is also clearly infiltrated. The same applies to the parlaryngeal musculature. The cranial accessorius nerve can be preserved. Thorough exposure of the internal jugular vein. The facial vein is infiltrated, otherwise the internal jugular vein can be preserved. Careful dissection of the common carotid artery. The mass extends directly to the perivascular connective tissue, but is certainly not infiltrated. Dissection in case of infiltration of the superior thyroid artery. There is also clear infiltration of the hypoglossal nerve. This is also removed. Dissection of the cervical vascular sheath, which is normal except for the infiltration of the structures mentioned. Clearing of the accessorius triangle while preserving the nerve. Clearing of level V with careful preservation of the cervical plexus branches. Overall en bloc resection of the massively surrounding scarred and massively perinodally growing metastasis. Careful wound inspection. Wound irrigation. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Turning to the opposite side: skin incision also made on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the facial vein and the cervical vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and clearing of level V a with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Careful wound inspection and, if the wound is dry, wound irrigation, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. Subsequent completion of the procedure with slim enoral conditions. The patient received intraoperative single-shot antibiotics with Unacid. Postoperative nutrition via the inserted nasogastric tube for 3 to 4 days, after which oral nutrition should be possible without any problems.

It can be seen that there is a narrow mucosal margin of about 2-3 mm between the lower pole of the right tonsil and the incipient exophytic mass. From there, the exophytic mass extends to the hypopharyngeal side wall with the extensions to the plica pharyngoepiglottica on the right side. The exophytic mass is only broadly attached to the posterior wall of the hypopharynx and has a relatively narrow base compared to the tumor volume. The mass is easily displaceable over the pharyngeal musculature. Then docking of the robot and insertion of the functional arms. With very good adjustability, the tumor can then be easily dissected from cranial to caudal using the Maryland grasping forceps and the monopolar spatula. Enter directly under the lower pole of the right tonsil. Then dissect laterally down to the pharyngeal muscles. Continue the incision along the pharyngeal muscles. Cut around the base of the tumor with a safety margin of about 3-5 mm. The dissection is then carried out successively further caudally with subtle hemostasis. Here the tumor is finally deposited at the pharyngoepiglottic plica. Now take representative margin samples from the anterior deposition area, the posterior deposition area, the deep deposition area at the wound bed and the caudal and cranial deposition margins. All margin samples are then sent for intraoperative frozen section diagnostics and are all found to be tumor-free. Subtle hemostasis is then performed. A vascular stump in the area of the hypopharyngeal side wall is dissected free and then carefully coagulated. Subsequently, the wound is dried even after the retractor has been relaxed. The creation of a tracheostoma is not necessary given the extent of the resection. The insertion of a nasogastric feeding tube is also not necessary. However, the patient should be given a diet with TE light food for the next few days. At the end of the procedure, another final consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. It was then agreed that the patient would be monitored postoperatively in the intensive care unit of the ENT clinic after the recovery phase.

Expose the pharyngeal muscles and then enter with the small bore tube and determine the site where the pharyngotomy will be performed. It can be seen that the tumor is at the entrance to the piriform sinus and is therefore also partially under the thyroid cartilage. Exposure of the upper horn of the thyroid cartilage and detachment of the piriform sinus from the thyroid cartilage on this side. The upper horn of the thyroid cartilage and a small part of the thyroid cartilage must be resected in order to reach the tumor properly. Then enter the pharynx and resect the tumor with a safety margin of 0.5 to 1 cm. The specimen is placed en bloc on cork and marked for histology. All margins free in the frozen section, i.e. intraoperative R0 situation on the specimen. Measure the defect 12 x 6 cm and mark on the forearm. Start preparation of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Exposure of the cephalic vein. Exposure of the brachiocephalic muscle. Showing the venous star in the crook of the elbow. Visualization of the venous confluence. Visualization of the radial superficial ramus nerve. Exposure of the radial artery. Removal of the radial artery. Lifting of the radialis graft from the tendons. Then dissection of the pedicle up to the crook of the elbow. Removal of the pedicle, including 2 deep veins and 1 superficial large cephalic vein. In the meantime, parallel neck dissection on the right side by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. After creation of the apron flap by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, perform a neck dissection on the right side Level II to V. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Tracing the omohyoid to the hyoid bone. Visualization of the cervical vascular sheath of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the posterior venter of the digaster. The borders are thus shown. Now detach the neck preparation from level II b, II, III, IV and V, preserving all non-lymphatic structures. The vagus nerve and carotid artery are exposed and spared. The accessor nerve is exposed and also spared. The plexus branches are clearly visible in depth and level V is cleared. No evidence of chyle fistula. Left Start of neck dissection by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and takeover of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath after the borders, i.e. sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid, submandibular and accessory gland and digastric muscle, have been exposed. Neck levels II to V were then removed. Plexus branches were spared, hypoglossus spared and accessorius nerve spared, cervical nerve spared. Then suturing of the radialis graft, first from the transoral, then from the transcervical side and removal of the pedicle to the left side. End-to-side anastomosis between the cephalic vein and internal jugular vein and coupler between the facial vein and a deep vein of the radialis graft and anastomosis between the radial artery and facial artery. Insertion of Redon drains, one on each side, and two-layer wound closure. Flap control according to the usual scheme, antibiotics for at least 24 hours.","Resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Infiltration also towards the base of the tongue and here the midline is reached but not crossed. Overall indication for tumor resection, neck dissection and coverage with a radial flap. The apron flap is lifted first and a tracheostoma is created. Tracheotomy: Horizontal incision just below the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Identification of the infralaryngeal musculature and division of the musculature in the midline. Push the musculature to the side and identify the cricoid cartilage. Sharp dissection of the cricoid cartilage and undermining of the thyroid isthmus. Bipolar coagulation of the thyroid isthmus and transection of the same. Identification of the anterior wall of the trachea. Careful removal of tissue from the anterior wall of the trachea. Tracheal incision in the 2nd to 3rd intratracheal ring space and creation of an epithelialized tracheostoma in the usual manner. Re-intubation with the 8-bore tracheostomy tube. PEG insertion: PEG insertion using the thread pull-through method. This is successful without any problems if the diaphanoscopy is positive. Tumor resection: First of all, cervical exposure of the cervical vessels as well as the hypoglossal nerve and vagus nerve. Snaring of these structures using Vessel-Loups. Vessels are dissected away from the soft tissue as far as the cranial side. The digastric muscle is severed and cut laterally and then resected at the lateral end. The mandible is exposed after pushing the soft tissues including the branch of the mouth cranially. The entire soft tissue is pushed away from the mandible with the periosteum from the angulus to the symphysis. Infrahyoid muscles are detached from the hyoid bone and dissected as a Remmert flap pedicled to the superior thyroid artery and the cervical artery and beaten downwards. The hyoid bone is then resected in the midline and included in the tumor resection together with all overlying soft tissue. The entire external musculature is resected in the midline. The entire dorsal body of the tongue, including the floor of the mouth and the largest parts of the sublingual gland, is resected transorally, except for the tip of the tongue. Resection also includes the areas of the tongue beyond the midline from the body of the tongue to the base of the tongue. The periosteum is also removed transorally from the lower jaw, the entire soft tissues and muscles of the floor of the mouth are also resected. The lingual nerve is also resected. In the further course of the operation, the hypoglossal nerve is also resected medial to the exit of the cervical nerve. The tumor is clearly resected macroscopically in healthy tissue and removed in toto. Multiple suture markings are made on the tumor, which is sent to the frozen section. Marginal samples of the mucosa are taken from the alveolar ridge to the floor of the mouth at the front, a further marginal sample of the mucosa from the middle of the tongue to the body with underlying soft tissue and soft tissue basally on the rest of the hyoid bone. All marginal samples and the marked tumor are sent for frozen section. Here, tumor in healthy tissue as well as marginal samples, thus R0 resection. Careful hemostasis and irrigation of the wound area and resection areas. The lingual artery and facial artery were already prepared as possible vascular anastomoses during the resection. The superior thyroid artery was included in the Remmert flap. Neck dissection on both sides by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Subplatysmal dissection of the apron flap. Beginning on the right side. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissection in depth. Finding the accessorius nerve and exposing it. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle and finding the submandibular gland. Elevation of the submandibular gland and protection of the marginal ramus. Exposure of the posterior venter of the digastric muscle up to region II b. Now expose and locate the accessorius nerve and protect it. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and its multiple outlets, including the facial vein. These are initially preserved, but then turned downwards to serve later as possible connecting vessels. Dissection of the jugulofacial angle and removal of multiple conspicuous lymph nodes. Protection of the hypoglossal nerve. Now dissection of the lateral neck preparation in regions II to V, sparing the vagus nerve and cervical plexus. The various branches of the external carotid artery are dissected in order to serve both as a Remmert flap and as connecting vessels. The lingual artery on the right side is removed. The cervical artery was also spared. On the left side, here too the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is exposed and the accessorius nerve is located, protected and preserved. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. Elevation of the gland, preserving the mandibular ramus and dissection on the digastric muscle posteriorly. Dissection along and on the internal jugular vein in a cranial direction. Here too, protect all outlets and the cervical vein. Follow the cervical vein to the hypoglossal muscle and preserve it. Now carefully dissect the lateral neck preparation and detach it while preserving the cervical plexus. It is cleared up to the omohyoid muscle, no chyle flow can be seen. There is also no increased bleeding. Now clear out the medial neck preparation, sparing all structures. The vagus nerve could also be visualized and preserved during the operation. The radial flap was then sutured into the defect. Successive suturing of the radial flap from the transcervical and transoral sides, partly after the sutures have been placed. The flap is successfully sutured in an anatomically three-dimensional manner so that both the lateral pharyngeal wall and floor of the mouth can be covered without tension, as well as the tongue and base of the tongue and the transition to the vallecula. The stalk is passed through the right side of the neck. Dissection of the facial vein, which has several outlets. Dissection of the facial artery. Anastomosis here, after conditioning the vessels with the radial artery. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. A branch of the facial vein is then anastomosed with the cephalic vein using a 3.5 mm coupler. The deep confluent vein is then anastomosed with another outlet from the facial vein using a 2.5 mm coupler. In each case, after opening the clamps, good venous flow and positive exclusion phenomenon. Overall, good blood flow after assessment of the flap. Extensive irrigation of the wound area. After further mobilization, the Remmert flap is sutured on the right side above the hyoid bone for volume augmentation. Subsequent careful hemostasis and irrigation of the wound area. Then wound closure in layers, with insertion of two flaps on the right and a Redon drain on the left and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. An 8 mm tracheostomy tube was then inserted and fixed in place. The defect on the forearm was primarily closed cranially and covered caudally with split skin, which was taken from the thigh on the right side. Defect augmentation using a Remmert flap from the right. Elevation of the radial forearm flap on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap borders 14 cm x 8 cm on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Covering of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Finally, attachment of the forearm. Good saturation and blood circulation of the left forearm at the end of the operation. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is ventilated and transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Please continue postoperative antibiotics with Unacid, as started intraoperatively, for one week. Nutrition via the inserted PEG tube for approx. 10 days, followed by an X-ray broth swallow and, if necessary, diet build-up. If necessary, initiate swallowing training in the voice and speech department. Control of the flap according to the scheme for 5 days by means of clinical checks and Doppler checks. Anastomosis area marked with right cervical suture. Awaiting the final histology. Then presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference to indicate radiochemotherapy if necessary.","Tumor resection, Neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheostomy, Endoscopy

Secondary findings included mediastinal lymphoma with tracheal invasion. After healing of extensive peritonitis and prior treatment of the lymphoma, the patient now presented for definitive treatment. Due to the secondary diseases, our interdisciplinary tumor conference decided that surgery was the treatment of choice.","First of all, after intubation and preparation by the anesthesia colleagues, positioning of the patient. Inspection of the primary tumor region. An exophytic, exulcerated tumor is found in the area of the left edge of the tongue and the soft palate with involvement of the posterior floor of the mouth. Palpation reveals that the majority of the tumor is growing submucosally into the tongue. The tumor clearly extends beyond the midline in the area of the base of the tongue, but with sufficient residual distance to the opposite side. In addition, the tumor is clearly growing towards the floor of the mouth and cervically. Transoral tumor resection is therefore performed first. Removal of the soft palate section, taking the tonsil lobe with it, resection of the posterior floor of the mouth and resection of the exophytic tumor section up to the area of the edge of the tongue. This resection is completely covered with margin samples, which are diagnosed as tumor- and dysplasia-free in the frozen section diagnostics. Now continue the tumor resection from the transcervical side. Submandibular skin incision, separation of skin and subcutaneous tissue, dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the hardened submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. The tumor can be palpated under the submandibular gland with infiltration of the lateral floor of the mouth. Due to the depth, first expose the vessels. Evacuation of the anterior neck preparation with removal of the facial vein and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein of the vagus nerve in the area of the internal jugular vein Level II and III, several macroscopically clearly suspicious nodules can be seen, but these can be separated from the accessorius nerve. Removal of the metastases in toto. Cranial dissection, resection of the digastric muscle. Release of the submandibular gland while sparing the ramus marginalis mandibulae. Palpation shows the tumor infiltrating the floor of the mouth up to just before the hyoid, here moderately displaceable, therefore involving the left half of the hyoid. Cranial dissection along the carotid artery. Separation of the facial artery and lingual artery. The hypoglossal nerve also appears to be pulling into the tumor conglomerate and is removed. Now successive extension of the pharyngotomy over the tonsillar lobe and the lateral floor of the mouth, continuing over the pharyngeal side wall up to the level of the vallecula. Resection as described of the hyoid with attached external floor of mouth muscles. Resection of the tumor within the tongue, leaving a muscle cuff on the tumor so that the final tumor can be resected macroscopically in sano; only at one point was there a muscle tear above the tumor capsule during dissection, which is marked. An extensive resection is performed to cover this area. Covering of the tumor in the marginal area and in the previously described muscular part with marginal samples, these are also diagnosed as tumor-free and dysplasia-free, so that a R0 situation can finally be assumed. Measurement of the defect. At the same time, the right-sided neck dissection was performed and the antero-lateral thigh graft was lifted to perform the neck dissection. A submandibular skin incision is also made here. Cutting through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the platysma. Dissection. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the hypoglossal nerve and the superior thyroid artery as well as the facial vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure and preservation of the accessory nerve, evacuation of the accessory triangle and level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Final wound inspection and wound irrigation and, if the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. To elevate the antero-lateral thigh graft after doppler sonographic identification of a main perforator and three secondary perforators, the graft measuring a total of 15 x 10 cm with soft palate and tongue base configuration is indicated. Medial incision. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the rectus femoris muscle. Strictly subfascial dissection. Identification of the pedicle vessel, which runs relatively cranially. The ramus descendens is relatively weak. Identification of the fasciocutaneous perforator, the secondary perforators run intramuscularly, complete resection of the graft. Partial entrainment of the fascia lata. Inclusion of a sufficient muscle cuff. Isolation to the pedicle vessel. Isolation on the artery and vein and, if the blood supply to the graft is normal, removal of the graft. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure and adaptation of the skin edges. Subsequent successive insertion of the graft, primarily via the tanscervical area. Overall very good fit. Reconstruction of the entire tongue and reconstruction of the largely resected base of the tongue with good volume filling. Transoral completion in the area of the soft palate and floor of the mouth. Overall intact conditions on all sides. Cervical anastomosis conditions significantly more difficult due to the position of the anastomosis and the now somewhat obstructive muscle cuff. Conditioning of the detached lingual artery, arterial anastomosis performed with 8-0 Ethilon with good flow under markedly difficult suturing conditions with pronounced arteriosclerosis in the area of the graft vessel. Overall, however, intact anastomosis with immediate regular venous return. Conditioning of the facial vein in the stump area. Sizing of a coupler size 3.5 and insertion of the venous anastomosis without any problems using the coupler system. Subsequent regular graft perfusion. The muscle cuff can now be well integrated into the neck, resulting in a good position of the anastomosis, but also complete filling of the neck. Therefore, a caudal rubber flap is inserted later. Careful two-layer wound closure. Finally, the tracheotomy is performed. In this case, post-tracheotomy at the beginning of the year. Opening of the skin scar, cutting of scars. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Reopening of the trachea in the former area between the 1st and 2nd tracheal ring, followed by insertion of the muco-cutaneous anastomosis and problem-free reintubation onto a size 8 low cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. The procedure was then completed with a vital graft. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0 resected cT4a cN2b tongue margin and tongue base carcinoma on the left. If the graft heals properly, the first attempts at swallowing can be started from the 8th postoperative day. Left cervical swelling due to the clear muscle cuff, please consult the surgeons before manipulation. Due to the extent of the tumor, adjuvant RCT appears to be urgently required.

CT imaging showed a large lymph node metastasis measuring at least 4 cm in level II on the right, which was relatively close to the primary, in the tonsil region with a circumscribed transition to the base of the tongue. In addition, further conspicuous lymph nodes in level II on CT, therefore a cN2b neck status. No evidence of distant metastases. Indication for primary surgical treatment, in case of extensive defect also indication for defect coverage by radial artery graft.","After intubation by the anesthesia colleagues, the patient is positioned. First of all, PEG insertion: for this purpose, insertion with a flexible gastroscope under laryngoscopic control. Easy to see through to the stomach. This appears regular and free. With a regular diaphanoscopy, the stomach is punctured without any problems and the PEG tube is inserted using the usual suture pull-through method. This was without any problems. No abnormalities on inspection of the oesophagus, apart from a few tablet residues. First, a pharyngo/laryngoscopy was performed to determine the extent of the tumor: an exophytic and ulcerated tumor was found in the area of the left tonsil lobe, which was largely limited to the tonsil region. In the area of the right edge of the tongue, superficial fleshy, reddish tissue, questionable as a tumor extension, which shows no deep infiltration on palpation. Relatively good mobility on palpation of the tumor, no deep infiltration. Free posterior pharyngeal wall, no growth towards the nasopharynx. Further tongue base, vallecula and epiglottis are free. The caudal tonsil is relatively fleshy. Here rather no tumor growth. Therefore, we now turn to primary enoral resection. Expose the tumor with the tonsil retractor and the Jennings retractor while looping the tongue. Inclusion of the entire anterior palatal arch to gain an overview. Resection to just parauvular. Therefore good mobilization of the tumour. Resection of the tumor in toto with removal of muscles in the area of the posterior palatal arch. Here the tumor is smoothly bordered and encapsulated, without tissue adherence. Relatively easy detachment without capsular injury. Caudal resection is also problem-free. The fleshy change in the area of the right or posterior right edge of the tongue is now removed with a safety margin of a good 1 cm. Free conditions in the depth here. Removal of approx. 1/2 cm of muscle cuff. Circumscribed resection of the glossotonsillar groove. However, this otherwise remains largely intact. There is also no resection towards the floor of the mouth. Involvement of the entire tonsil including the caudal change. Therefore resection up to the level of the epiglottis. Minutious hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. After extirpation of the tumor, re-inspection. In the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, a macroscopically narrow resection distance can be seen medially. The capsule of the tumor can be seen circumscribed caudally. However, there is no breakthrough or open tissue. Therefore, a complete resection was first made in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall and parauvularly up to the caudal margin. Now insert the entire specimen, which is marked on all sides, and the resected specimen for frozen section diagnostics. With a short resection distance in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall, the post-resection is now exposed here. Basally in the cranial part, the resection distance is very short here with the capsule partially exposed, as described. The resection margin in the area of the anterior palatal arch is also narrow, otherwise the resection margins are macroscopically and microscopically tumor-free on all sides, especially in the area of the tongue. Therefore, at a later stage, a resection and a final margin specimen are formed in the area of the entire anterior palatal arch and in the area of the wound bed in the area of the posterior palatal arch, covering it completely. The final marginal sample is diagnosed as tumor-free at both sites in the frozen section diagnostics. Therefore, no further measures are required. Minutious hemostasis and check for blood dryness. On palpation, even before the necks are performed, a clear soft tissue mantle is still visible in addition to the clearly palpable metastasis in level II on the right. Therefore, we now turn to the neck dissections, starting with the neck dissection on the left: After repositioning and instillation of xylocaine with the addition of adrenaline, start on the left side: curved skin incision submandibularly and on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the superior thyroid artery, the facial vein and the cervical vein. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein after prior exposure and protection of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Subsequent evacuation of level V with careful protection of the plexus branches. No evidence of lymphatic leakage caudally. Subsequent careful wound inspection and wound irrigation with Ringer's solution and, if wound conditions are dry and level IIa to V is completely evacuated, insertion of a 10 Redon drain in the case of clinical cN0 aspect and later careful two-layer wound closure after checking again for blood dryness. Turning now to the opposite side: Here also skin incision, submandibularly curved at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Separation of the platysma. Creation of a platysma flap. Palpation of the metastasis, which is mainly located in level IIa, appears to measure approx. 4 x 5 cm and is relatively easy to move with the surrounding area. Palpatorily no infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle or adherence to other structures. Therefore, visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at level II of the metastasis on the muscle without signs of muscle infiltration for ............. a safety margin. Inclusion of a circumscribed muscle cuff. Expose the omohyoid muscle at this point. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Removal of the anterior neck preparation with exposure and preservation of the facial vein, the hypoglossal nerve and the superior thyroid artery. Ansa cervicalis was removed here. Now free preparation of the internal jugular vein. The large mass is seen in level IIa, lying directly on the vein in the area of the jugulofacial angle, but here there is no evidence of infiltration with strict vascular dissection. In addition, level III, located directly on the internal jugular vein, shows a nodular lymph node change measuring approx. 2 x 2 1/2 cm. Confirmation of the CT findings. Visualization of the accessorius nerve. The metastasis lies on the nerve, but clearly does not infiltrate it. The metastasis can be easily detached from the nerve. After complete visualization of the digastric muscle, detachment from the metastasis is also possible. Good caudal detachment from the caudal parotid pole. Here only adjacent metastasis, no evidence of infiltration. Overall metastasis limited to the lymph node, measuring approx. 4 x 5 cm, which is removed in toto. Finally, the accessorius triangle was removed, carefully sparing the nerves, and Levl V was removed, carefully sparing the plexus, with no evidence of lymphatic leakage. Now, after complete removal of the neck resectate, inspection of the wound cavities, especially palpation towards level IIa, towards the tonsil lobe. Here, palpation also reveals a clear soft tissue mantle and a well-protected carotid artery. Findings demo and case discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Due to the non-penetrating defect of the stable soft tissue mantle, confirmation of the extent and also no indication for radial flap coverage. Therefore, careful inspection of the wound surfaces. Irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. If the wound is dry, insertion of a 10 Redon drain and careful two-layer wound closure. The previously dictated resections are now carried out. Final wound inspection. After meticulous hemostasis, the wound is dry. A relatively large wound area is now visible. After resection of the anterior palatal arch, resection towards the soft palate, resection up to the posterior pharyngeal wall and resection in the area of the pharynx caudal to the level of the epiglottis as well as circumscribed resection of the edge of the tongue. Due to the large wound area and extent, the decision was made to perform a protective tracheostomy. Prior to this, the wound surfaces in the area of the tongue edge are adapted with 3.0 Vicryl. Also adaptation of muscle cords in the area of the posterior pharyngeal wall and parauvular tissue. Finally, inspection under dry conditions. Finally, perform the tracheotomy: modified Kocher collar incision, approx. 1 cm below the relatively deep cricoid cartilage. Very short distance between jugulum and cricoid cartilage. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. A very strong, pronounced vein is seen subcutaneously, almost the caliber of an internal jugular vein. This is exposed, ligated and ligated. Further exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Entering the linea alba. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. The glandular isthmus is relatively weakly developed and is coagulated. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Finally, problem-free transfer to an 8 mm tracheoflex cannula and completion of the procedure at this point. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT2 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right with protective tracheostomy and extensive resection area, but with good conditions for primary wound healing. After a swallowing test, a liquid diet can be started from the 3rd postoperative day. If swallowing function and wound development are normal, decannulation may be possible from the 5th to 7th postoperative day. After receiving the definitive histology, presentation at our interdisciplinary tumor conference. Due to the aggressive metastasis, adjuvant therapy is certainly required here.","Transoral tumor resection

The arytenoid cartilage of the left side also appears to be infiltrated by the tumor, so that the above-mentioned indication for surgery was given.","After induction of intubation anesthesia, repeat microlaryngoscopy and check of the tumor extent, which has not changed since the previous examination. Then injection of local anesthetic with adrenaline and transverse skin incision over the thyroid cartilage. Layer-by-layer preparation in depth. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage surface reveals the tumor that has migrated through. This exposes the entire thyroid cartilage surface and the cricoid cartilage. Then open the thyroid cartilage paramedian on the right with the wheel. Then make a vertical incision paramedian on the left with the wheel. Now push off the periosteum, initially on the left side. Then also a little on the right side. Then open the endolarynx paramedian on the right. The tumor on the left is clearly visible here. The tumor is now first removed from the right vocal fold with a safety margin of 2-3 mm and dissected to the left side. There, resection of the entire anterior commissure en bloc with the attached thyroid cartilage and resection of the endolarynx on the left side at the glottis level up to the subglottic level and up to the middle level of the pouch ligament on the left side. It can be seen that the tumor clearly infiltrates the ary, so that this is disarticulated and also removed. The tumor is then removed at the interarytaenoid muscles. A marginal sample is taken here. Similarly, removal of marginal samples in the area of the margin on the right side. It then becomes apparent that the tumor possibly extends to the cricoid cartilage here, so here too cricoid cartilage is initially removed basally and ventrally. The dorsal edge sample and the edge sample in the interarytaenoid area are not diagnosed as reliably tumor-free, so a resection is performed here. A second marginal sample is then taken from the dorsal area of the cricoid cartilage and the interarytaenoid muscles. These are then found to be tumor-free intraoperatively. Therefore, the cricoid cartilage plate and the articular surface of the cricoarytaenoid joint are now abraded. The tumor is thus resected in consideration of the marginal specimens R0. The incision is then made further caudally in front of the trachea and dissected in layers in depth. Separation of the infralaryngeal musculature. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is first undermined and then cut on both sides. Repeated exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Then open the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilage rod. Preparation of a Björk flap and subsequent circular mucocutaneous anastomosis of the tracheostoma. Then reintubation. After subtle endolaryngeal hemostasis, readaptation of the pouch ligament on the left side and of the vocal fold and pouch ligament on the right side, which are fixed to the thyroid cartilage framework with PDS sutures. The thyroid cartilage surface is covered with a dorsally pedicled mucosal flap. The same applies to the articular surface of the arytaenoid joint on the left side. Then check the bleeding again. Then adaptation and suturing of the two thyroid cartilage surfaces. A small remaining gap is closed with prelaryngeal muscle pedicled from the left. A wound flap is then inserted and the wound is closed in two layers. After applying a dressing and inserting a nasogastric feeding tube, the procedure is completed. In the case of cN0 neck status, neck dissection is not performed on both sides. The patient was shielded intraoperatively with intravenous antibiotics with Unacid, which should be continued until the 3rd postoperative day. An attempt to swallow is possible after about 8 days. Until then, the patient should be fed via the nasogastric feeding tube. Depending on the result of the swallowing test, the patient can then be given a diet or swallowing training.","Partial laryngeal resection, Tracheostomy

In CT and ultrasound, midline crossing to the right, in CT approx. 1/2 cm, in sonogram slightly above. Size approx. 2 x 3 cm.","This is followed by pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The tumorous process is visible, which extends from the left pharyngoepiglottic plica over the base of the tongue and vallecula area to the midline to the right by about 1 cm. Involvement of the vallecula, the left epiglottis and the caudal base of the tongue. Deep tumor crater to the left. Laser resection now follows: positioning of the tumor with a spreading laryngoscope. The tumor is removed macroscopically at a distance of approx. 1 cm on all sides in healthy tissue. Resection extends from the right paramedian to the left just below the tonsil lobe. The entire base of the tongue is resected caudally and the hyoid bone is exposed, almost over the entire plane. Complete vallecular resection, resection of the left mucosa of the epiglottis except for a small region just in front of the point of envelope. The specimen is removed, thread-marked and sent for frozen section. In addition, a wide mass from the entire cranial region is sent in. The specimen is relatively scarce in the cranial direction, but is well covered by the cranial margin specimen, which is healthy. Tumor cells are still scattered laterally to the right and especially caudally to the right. However, intraepithelial lymphangiosis is also detectable towards the depth. Therefore another resection to the right, very carefully so as not to damage the lingual artery. The left lingual artery had already been closed with clips. Resection of this 1 cm wide strip with underlying soft tissue now follows. Resection extends from right lateral cranial to right lateral caudal, including the lateral parts of the epiglottis. Strip is sent in, no more tumor infiltrates here. Thus an overall R0 situation. Careful hemostasis is now performed. Resection was performed using a 5-6 watt superpulse laser. The patient is now transferred for modified radical neck dissection and tracheostomy. First decision to insert a PEG tube in the typical manner. This is done without complications using the suture pull-through method with adequate diaphanoscopy. A neck dissection is then performed on the right side. Creation of a skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure in the depth of the nervus accessorius, the omohyoid muscle and the digaster muscle. Dissection of the above-mentioned structures revealed several highly visible masses in regions II to V b, partly with the sternocleidomastoid muscle caudally with the omohyoid muscle, especially the masses in regions IV and V b were broadly adjacent to the internal jugular vein. First attempt to dissect along the cervical vascular sheath. Difficult dissection, scarred conditions. Exposure and protection of the vagus nerve and the common carotid artery. Removal of the posterior neck specimen together with the highly suspicious mass in regions II to IV while sparing the above-mentioned structures. Removal of fibers of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the neck preparation. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Protection of the deep plexus branches. Then concentrate on the highly suspicious mass in regions IV and V b. Dissection of the omohyoid muscle. Inclusion of fibers of the omohyoid muscle in the preparation. Heavily scarred conditions. It is then possible to first find a layer on the internal jugular vein and then to detach the large conglomerate of Regio IV and V b from the internal jugular vein. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Subsequent removal of the anterior neck specimen. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation using hydrogen peroxide and Ringer's solution. Placement of a 10 Redon drain. Two-layer wound closure. Now repositioning of the patient to perform a neck dissection on the left side. Sonographic cN3 neck status with a large mass over 6 cm in regions II and III and two small, highly suspicious masses, cystically altered, in regions IV and V b. Creation of a skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut through the skin, the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Expose and dissect along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. In this step, the N3 metastasis in regions II and III is already encountered, which appears cystically altered. Dissection along this mass in regions II and III, exposing the posterior belly of the digastric muscle and the capsule of the submandibular gland, which is removed from the specimen. Inclusion of fibers of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the preparation. The nervus accessorius cannot be preserved due to clear infiltration and is removed with the preparation. Subcutaneous tissue from region V and muscle fibers of the scalene muscles are included in the preparation. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Subsequent dissection from cranial to caudal. Removal of the neck specimen together with the highly suspicious mass in region IV. Very careful, laborious dissection in region V b. Removal of the neck specimen in toto. Extensive hemostasis in region V b using bipolar coagulation. Exposure and protection of the neck vessel sheath. Extremely difficult dissection in region V b. This results in a small tear in the internal jugular vein, which is immediately treated using Vascufil suture 6-0. Removal of the anterior neck specimen. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Placement of a 10 Redon drain and two-layer wound closure and completion of the neck dissection on the left side. Due to the large wound area ..... and the left vallecula and the expected pronounced dysphagia, the decision was made to perform a tracheostomy in the typical manner. Creation of a skin incision directly below the level of the cricoid cartilage, approx. 3 cm long. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Exposure of the anterior wall of the thyroid isthmus. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus using Pean clamps. Separation of the thyroid isthmus and ligation of both thyroid stumps. Exposure of the anterior wall of the trachea. Creation of a tracheal incision between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage clasp. Creation of a Björk flap in the typical manner and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Reintubation to a size 8 Rügheim tracheostomy tube. Completion of the procedure without complications. Transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit. Feeding for at least 1 week via PEG tube, then cautious diet build-up. Due to the overall situation, postoperative RCT should certainly be discussed in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Laser resection, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy

To do this, adjust the entrance to the larynx with the laryngoscope. Insert the 0° scope. The right arytenoid cusp is clearly swollen, oedematous, very narrow glottic gap. The subglottic space, the trachea up to the bifurcation and the visible main bronchi are unremarkable. After intubation, an esophagoscopy is performed and the flexible esophagoscope is inserted into the stomach. Conditions there are unremarkable. No evidence of a tumor in the area of the cardia even when looking backwards. Diaphanoscopy, insertion of the PEG using the thread pull-through method. The esophagus is usually checked again when the endoscope is withdrawn. No evidence of a second tumor. Problem-free PEG placement. Pharyngoscopy: Adjustment of the small bore tube. As described above, the exophytic growing tumor can be seen in the area of the right aryepiglottic fold merging with the upper piriform sinus. The rest of the right piriform sinus and the entire left piriform sinus and the postcricoid region are unremarkable. The esophageal entrance is clear. The base of the tongue, epiglottis and valecula are unremarkable. In addition, microlaryngoscopy only shows edematous conditions on the right side in the region of the laryngeal head. This is probably submucosal tumor growth. The vocal folds are, as far as can be seen, unremarkable. The supraglottic region on the left is also unremarkable. The base of the tongue is soft on palpation. After completion of the panendoscopy, detailed consultation with the anesthesiologist regarding the further procedure. Preparation for laryngectomy. The tumor is resectable. Perioperative administration of Unacid. Continue this postoperatively. Skin disinfection, infiltration anesthesia for the apron flap. Neck dissection on the right side first. Make an incision from the earlobe to the supraclavicular area. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle and cut off the external jugular vein. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, facial vein, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, digasticus muscle, posterior vena cava. Now dissection of the posterior part of the neck from the accessorius area to the supraclavicular area. Overall very difficult dissection conditions due to the very voluminous conditions. At least two suspicious nodes on this side, especially in the vein angle. Further dissection in the direction of the venous angle. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, the cervical nerve. This will be cut later. Expose the external, internal and common carotid artery and the superior laryngeal artery. This is stitched. Now complete the anterior neck preparation, including the capsule of the submandibular gland. Separate the common carotid artery, the thyroid gland and the larynx. Now perform the neck dissection on the left side. Also make a skin incision from infraauricular to supraclavicular. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, cut off the external jugular vein. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, the accessorius nerve and the vagus nerve. Dissection of the digasticus muscle, posterior venter and dissection of the posterior neck preparation from cranial to caudal to supraclavicular on the left side. After cutting through the caudal end, repositioning to prevent a fistula. Now expose the common, external and internal carotid artery. Separation and ligation of the superior vein. Exposure of the hyperglossal nerve, completion of the anterior neck preparation including the capsule of the submandibular gland. Very difficult preparation conditions on this side due to the voluminous conditions. Complete the neck preparation on the left side. Now join the two neck incisions and dissect an apron flap cranially up to the hyoid. Expose the laryngeal skeleton on both sides and free preparation of the piriform sinus on both sides, detachment from the thyroid cartilage. Now cut the infrahyoid muscles and enter the pharynx just above the epiglottis. Grasp the epiglottis and resect the mucosa in the area of the aryepiglottic fold on both sides up to the intraaryhaenoid region. The tumor is located on the right side. Here, the piriform sinus is partially incised and the post-crecoid region is then reached again from the other side, from the caudal side. Clinically, the resection is performed in sano. Push the postcrecoid region caudally. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage, separation of the larynx from the pharynx. Sever the connection between the larynx and trachea. The laryngectomy specimen now removed is sent for definitive histology. Representative marginal samples are taken. These are described as mild dysplasia in the frozen section. No carcinoma in situ, no invasive carcinoma. A Provox prosthesis is then placed. This was relatively successful with good visibility. Somewhat difficult threading in the area of the trachea. In the end, however, the Provox prosthesis fits well. Extensive hemostasis with H2O2 and bipolar coagulation. Irrigation with H2O2 solution and Ringer's solution. No more bleeding. Now perform the pharyngeal suture, initially caudally and cranially and then also in the middle section of the pharynx. Complete closure. Repeat several times and three-layer wound closure in the area of the pharynx. Reapproximation of the infrahoidal musculature in the area of the hyoid bone. Suture the trachea as a tracheostoma into the skin flap and supraclavicularly. Now clean the neck again on both sides, rinse with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. No bleeding. Insertion of a Redon drain on both sides. Subcutaneous suture, skin suture and wound dressing. A feeding tube was inserted preoperatively. This should serve as a nasogastric tube for splinting for a few days. Insertion of a tracheal cannula, which is fixed with stitches. Completion of the procedure. No bleeding, no other special features. Pass on antibiotics postoperatively. Finally, another detailed consultation with the anesthetist.

The above-mentioned operation was therefore indicated. The patient was also informed about the possible need for flap surgery.,"(<CLINICIAN_NAME>) Pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The exophytic tumor is visible, which leads from the anterior palatal arch via the tonsillar lobe, the alveolar ridge and the floor of the mouth to the edge and base of the tongue. Attempt at PEG insertion: Insertion with the esophagoscope. Advance into the stomach. However, diaphanoscopy cannot be established here and PEG placement cannot be carried out with sufficient certainty. The attempt to insert a PEG is therefore discontinued. If necessary, this would then have to be performed secondarily in surgery or internal medicine. Alternate positioning of the head and insertion of the McIvor blade or retractor. Exposure of the tumor. This runs from the anterior palatal arch over the alveolar ridge onto the floor of the mouth to the base of the tongue, which infiltrates minimally, with anterior infiltration of the edge of the tongue on the right. A tumor cone can also be felt in the edge of the tongue, individual satellites at the transition to the floor of the mouth. The tumor is now resected with a safety margin of at least 1 ˝ cm on all sides. The anterior palatal arch and the soft tissues above the alveolar ridge are removed, although the periosteal layer can be preserved here. The resection also includes the tonsil lobe with adjacent musculature, transition to the floor of the mouth, where the lingual nerve is exposed but can be preserved, as can the Wharton's duct. The resection leads over the floor of the mouth into the edge of the tongue, which is resected over a width of 1 to 2 cm in the posterior region, as is a small part of the base of the tongue. The preparation is thread-marked. Another separate marginal sample from the basal area of the tongue margin is also taken, here including a large slice of muscle. Both the entire specimen and the marginal specimen in healthy tissue, thus R0 resection in a frozen section. Indication for flap creation borderline. Due to the preserved posterior palatal arch, the coverage of the bone in the ascending mandibular branch and the still well-preserved mucosal area in the area of the glossoalveolar groove, the decision was made not to perform a flap here. Therefore, repositioning for neck dissection on both sides. (V. Bezas) Neck dissection on both sides and temporary tracheostomy. Initial repositioning for neck dissection on the right. Curved skin incision in typical manner. After cutting through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma, expose the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

Including exposure of the vagus nerve. Further dissection to the cranial side, here the hypoglossal nerve and the hypoglossal sac are exposed under the digastric muscle. Exposure of the nervus accessorius and free preparation of the neck dissectate from cranial to caudal. Further successive dissection and entrainment of the nodes from level II to V. The branches of the cervical plexus are preserved. Subtle hemostasis. Creation of a Redon drainage. Two-layer suture. Now proceed to neck dissection on the left side. Here the dissection is carried out in the usual way as on the right side. Here, however, with cN0 sonographic findings, the neck dissection is performed at levels II to IV. After careful hemostasis, irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Application of a Redon drainage. Two-layer suture. Now proceed to permanent tracheostomy.

Inspection of the endolarynx: No evidence of a suspicious mass. Removal of the small drainage tube while preserving the mucosa. Insertion of the Jennings mouth retractor. Inspection of the oral vestibule and oral cavity: An oval, broad-based, verrucous, exophytic, rough mass measuring 4.5 x 3.5 cm was found on the edge and undersurface of the tongue, starting on the right from the tip of the tongue to the second premolar tooth. On palpation, the mass grew minimally into the tongue musculature. After consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, a decision is made to perform a trial excision. A trial excision is made at a distance of 0.3 mm from the edge of the tumor. Targeted bipolar coagulation of the irradiating blood vessels. Further dissection caudally until the lingual nerve is identified. The lingual nerve extends into the mass, making transection necessary. Further gentle conditions in the area of the sublingual curcule and preservation of the Wharton's duct. After resection, demonstration on <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Decision on primary wound closure. A circular marginal sample 0.3 mm wide is taken, marked and sent for histological analysis. Another thin sample was taken from the tip of the tongue. Primary defect closure.

Easy pre-scanning into the stomach. If the diaphanoscopy is excellent, the stomach is punctured without any problems and the PEG tube is inserted using the usual thread pull-through method. Inspection of the oesophagus during reflection, inconspicuous conditions here. Now insertion with the small water tube, later supported with the TE blocker. A whitish, coarse, exophytic tumor of the right tonsil is seen, which clearly extends caudally, spreads to the posterior palatal arch in the lower half and leaves the tonsil lobe caudally and grows onto the oropharyngeal side wall up to the border of the hypopharyngeal side wall. Growth over the glossotonsillar groove circumscribed to the base of the tongue. Here also circumscribed infiltration of the base of the tongue. Posterior pharyngeal wall and soft palate are free. Now demonstration of findings on <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Due to the extent, confirmation of the indication for radial flap coverage, combined resection transorally and transcervically due to the growth. Start now with transoral resection: Initially transoral resection as for tumor TE, including the anterior palatal arch. Good overview. Exclusion of growth towards the pterygoid muscles. The posterior palatal arch can be well preserved cranially. Resection to parauvular. Here, however, no resection of the soft palate. Caudal removal of the posterior palatal arch. Now resection of the part of the glossotonsillar groove with complete removal of the glossotonsillar groove. Resection of the base of the tongue. Here, however, further resection of the base of the tongue transcervically for a better overview. Now carry out covering edge samples in the area of the soft palate, the posterior palatal arch and the buccal transition. These are completely tumor-free in the frozen section examination. Therefore, repositioning for neck dissection and completion of the tumor resection. Curved skin incision on the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side after injection of xylocaine with adrenaline. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and transection of the platysma and creation of a platysma flap. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digastric muscle and the submandibular gland. Palpation of 2 coarse lymph nodes level II/III located in the area of the jugulofacial angle, certainly without infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Clearing of the anterior neck preparation with preservation of the superior thyroid and the facial vein, which is very pronounced here. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Difficult preparation conditions in the area of the metastasis. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Protection and preservation of the nerve. Difficult preparation conditions in the area of the metastases in the area of the internal jugular vein. Certainly no infiltration here, but vulnerable vascular conditions and two tears. Suture and ligature, but with preservation of continuity of the vein. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus. Removal of the neck preparation en bloc. Now also evacuation of level Ib with infiltration of the glossotonsillar groove close to the posterior floor of the mouth. Subcapsular dissection of the submandibular gland. Extirpation of several lymph nodes measuring up to 1.5 cm. Removal of the gland. Final palpation. In free conditions, resection of the digastric muscle with planned flap coverage. Now orientate the digastric muscle at the posterior upper edge of the hyoid. Entering the oral cavity in the area of the posterior floor of the mouth. Widening of the pharyngotomy. Exposure of the resected edge of the tongue and the lateral wall of the pharynx. Now a good overview of the remaining tumor. Resection of the tumor in the area of the base of the tongue generously with circumscribed nodular infiltration in the area of the base of the tongue. Widening of the muscle cuff and later removal of a marginal sample. Resection of the tumor. Inspection. Findings demo to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. It can now be seen that the tumor in the area of the caudal pharyngeal wall is somewhat narrowly resected macroscopically on the specimen, as well as at the site in the area of the base of the tongue, where the safety margin was already widened during dissection. A generous resection is now taken at both sites together with the thread-marked main preparation and sent for frozen section diagnostics. Here, the tumor is classified as R0 on the specimen, but with narrow resection margins in the area of the caudal pharyngeal wall and in the area of the tongue. However, the resections here are completely tumor-free, meaning that the resection is R0 overall. Now measuring the graft. A 9 x 7 cm graft is later lifted, taking into account the resection area on the tongue and the resection of the glossotonsillar groove. Now continue to perform the neck dissection on the right side in parallel and remove the radialis graft in the area of the left forearm. First perform the neck dissection. Skin incision and cutting of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Dissection of the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the external jugular vein and the auricular nerve. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Release of the anterior neck preparation with careful protection of the cervical artery of the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Here, several lymph nodes that are macroscopically conspicuous in size and number, which are not yet primarily metastatic. Clearing of the accessorius triangle and level V with careful protection of the accessorius nerve and the cervical plexus branches. Final check. Irrigation of the wound. In dry conditions, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure. Now to lift the radial implant. After applying the tourniquet and marking the graft, cut around it while lifting a skin monitor. Expose the cephalic vein to take the vein with you. Perform the Hayden maneuver and expose the superficial radial nerve ramus. Exposure of the distal vascular pedicle strictly subfascial to the dissection. Ligation of the pedicle. Further meticulous sufascial dissection with clipping of distal vessels close to the stalk. A relatively high brachial artery with a very strong ulnar artery can now be seen in the crook of the elbow. This is visualized and preserved. The proximal radial artery stump is relatively weak. Exposure of the outlet of the interosseous artery. This is preserved. Exposure of the venous bridge between the deep radial system and the cephalic vein, which is strongly pronounced. Separation of the veins while carefully preserving the bridge. Reopening of the tourniquet and minute hemostasis. Excellent flap vitality and after hemostasis removal of the graft after ligation of the radial artery with preservation of the interosseous artery and removal of the cephalic vein. In the meantime, the tracheotomy was also performed. Horizontal skin incision for this. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. Ligation of the isthmus and transection. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Insertion between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring. Creation of a broad-based pedicled Björk flap and insertion of the tracheostoma in the usual manner. Finally, easy transfer to an 8 mm tracheoflex cannula and suturing of the same. Now, first of all, placement of sutures transcervically in the area of the base of the tongue and in the area of the caudal pharyngeal wall. First incorporate the graft transorally. This works well. Good fit. Reconstruction of the anterior palatal arch, glossotonsillar groove and lateral pharyngeal wall. Further transzevical incorporation. Suturing in the area of the vallecula, the base of the tongue and the pharyngeal side wall under moderate tension. Now placement of the vascular pedicle. Suture the skin monitor caudally with a very long vascular pedicle. Exposure of the superior thyroid artery. The superior thyroid artery must now be shortened several times in order to achieve a thickness of approximately the same caliber. However, the vessel is very tortuous, and despite multiple positioning of the Acland clamps and the vascular pedicle, the angulation is unfavorable. Therefore extremely difficult anastomization conditions. Performing an anastomosis with 8.0 Ethilon. Finally, regular anastomization despite extremely difficult conditions. After reopening the clamps, regular venous return and good flap vitality. Now, after vascular preparation of the facial vein and the radial vein, perform the venous anastomosis with a size 4 coupler. This works well with a strong radial vessel and a very strong facial vein. Immediate good blood circulation and regular vitality. Overall, however, a tendency to displacement due to the long course of the vessel or stalk. Therefore careful placement. Careful two-layer wound closure. During the final check, a pale graft is noticed which does not bleed after puncture. Therefore the decision is made to reopen the neck in case of arterial problems. Visualization of the arterial anastomosis with macroscopically normal venous anastomosis. There is no longer a transmitted pulse. The artery is therefore removed. A thrombus is now visible. Despite removal of the thrombus and repeated flushing, there is no more arterial bleeding. Therefore, this vessel is removed and an arterial anastomosis is performed again. Careful dissection. The facial artery was already removed during tumor dissection. Now expose a somewhat cranially located vascular outlet, most likely corresponding to the ascending pharyngeal artery and macroscopically largely equivalent in caliber. Exposure of the vessel. Intermediate involvement of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Now renewed vessel anastomization with 8.0 ethilon. Again, difficult suturing conditions due to the position of the vessel. Finally, however, regular flow, immediately good venous filling and regular flap vitality. Now, with regular vitality, wound closure in two layers. Final check and no further measures and transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit. A 10 x 6 cm full-thickness skin graft had already been removed from the right groin. Cutaneous preparation, mobilization of the subcutaneous tissue, careful two-layer wound closure after insertion of a 10 Redon drainage and finally careful incorporation of the full-thickness skin graft into the forearm. Two-layer wound closure and final application of a vacuum dressing and termination of the procedure at this point. Conclusion: Intraoperative cT3 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left with intraoperative R0 resection. Defect coverage using a radialis graft with difficult anastomization conditions due to the vessel position and the length of the stalk. Meticulous flap control postoperatively. On the 8th postoperative day, an X-ray pumice should be taken. If the flap conditions are intact, the patient can then be gradually fed and decannulated, depending on the swallowing function. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics of Unacid and a single dose of 250 mg SDH. After receiving the histology, presentation at our interdisciplinary tumor conference to plan the adjuvant therapy.","Pharyngectomy, Free flap (Radial)

Careful medialization of the middle turbinate without fracturing it. A polypous mucosa is seen in the area of the middle nasal passage, which is resected with the blunt Blakesley. In addition, the middle turbinate is polypous and distended. The lateral part of the middle turbinate is carefully resected with the sharp Blakesley. The middle turbinate is not fractured. Overall, macroscopically non-suspicious conditions. The removed sample is sent to the pathology department for frozen section examination. After consultation with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, it is an inflammatory polyp with no evidence of malignancy. Now completion of nasal inspection without complications or bleeding. Repositioning of the patient for pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: Insertion of the small bore tube size C and D again after insertion of a mouth guard. The described exophytic tumor can be seen, which runs laterally from the anterior area of the left lateral wall over the anterior wall to the area of the arytenoid fold and extends here to the arytenoid cartilage. Thickening at the back in the area between the arytenoid cartilage, cricoid cartilage and thyroid cartilage. Tumor infiltration can also be seen here on CT, which ultimately leads to the indication for laryngectomy. Initial PEG placement: adjustment of the esophageal inlet. Careful advancement with the flexible gastroesophagoscope into the stomach. Inspection of all sections of the stomach, which are unremarkable. Now perform the positive diaphanoscopy and insert the PEG tube in the usual manner using the thread pull-through method. Subsequent repositioning for laryngectomy and neck dissection on both sides: also cover the left forearm if radial flap is necessary. First of all, positioning and neck dissection on both sides. Neck dissection on the right: skin incision and dissection through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Subplatysmal dissection of the apron flap. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and discovery of the accessorius nerve. Now expose the omohyoid muscle and expose the medial edge. Dissect the submandibular gland and expose the posterior venter of the digastric muscle, sparing the marginal ramus until posterior to level IIb. Now open the cervical vascular sheath and expose the internal jugular vein and the facial vein. Protection of the cervical sinus and the hypoglossal nerve in the jugulofacial angle. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Clearing of level IIb, the accessorius nerve is unusually high here, but can be spared without any problems. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessory nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Removal of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the brachial plexus, the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the vagus nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Careful dissection of the caudal margin and careful hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Now also removal of the medial neck preparation. Neck dissection on the left: Positioning of the patient by the surgeon in a slightly reclined position. Injection of Suprarenin in the area of the skin incision. Now mark the skin incision and cut through the cutaneous-subcutaneous tissue. An apron flap is selected for the incision. Now cut through the platysma and subplatysmal dissection of the apron flap until the submandibular gland is exposed on both sides just above the hyoid bone. Approximation of the apron flap and identification of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Identification of the omohyoid muscle. Now dissection along the sternocleidomastoid muscle into the depths, exposing and sparing the branches of the cervical plexus. Now also identification of the accessorius nerve. Identification at the cranial end of the posterior venter of the digastric muscle and careful release of the neck dissection onto the muscle. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and protection of the nerve. Displacement and at the end of the operation re-embedding of the accessorius nerve in the sense of a neurolysis. Now dissection medially along the cervical vascular nerve sheath and detachment of the neck preparation from the cervical vascular nerve sheath. Then detachment of the neck preparation in regions II to IV while preserving the neuronal and vascular structures. Then laryngectomy and partial pharyngeal resection on the left: First dissection of the infrahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone. Fat and lymph node tissue, which lies in front of the infrahyoid musculature, is sent in separately as neck dissection level VI. Infrahyoid musculature is dissected and cut caudally. The superior cornu is released on the right, the constrictor is dissected. This is not possible on the left due to the tumor location. The thyroid gland is dissected caudolaterally on both sides, with a remnant still present on the right. In the isthmus area, a small, harder nodule is seen, which is also removed on the way to removal of the larynx. The left thyroid gland remnant with the cranial cystic mass is not touched and is dissected caudolaterally. The suprahyoid muscles are then dissected from the hyoid bone and beaten caudally with pre-epiglottic fatty tissue. Entering the pharynx, grasping the epiglottis. Successive detachment of the mucosa, which was previously dissected from the inside of the thyroid cartilage on the right side to preserve the piriform sinus. From the left side, the tumor is now cut around under direct vision with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm on all sides. This ultimately results in a partial pharyngeal resection that extends to the tip of the piriform sinus, but not quite to the end of the tip of the piriform sinus. The larynx is removed caudally, whereby the maximum mucosal width is also preserved postcricoidally. The larynx is finally removed caudally together with the tumor. Prior to this, a tracheotomy is created between the 1st and 2nd intercartilaginous spaces and re-intubation. Finally, the larynx is removed. Tumor with surrounding mucosa is marked with a suture. A marginal sample is taken from the left-lateral pharyngeal region, which is thread-marked and sent to the frozen section. There is still a small tumor nest in the frozen section towards the cranial side. Therefore, a resection is performed in the base of the tongue and cranial-lateral pharyngeal wall area, followed by removal of a marginal sample from this area. No more tumor in the marginal sample. Thus now R0 status. Assessment of the remaining pharynx. This can still be sutured well without becoming too tight. To improve the passage, after further dissection of the thyroid gland on the left side, a myotomy is performed in the area of the cricopharyngeal muscle and constrictor pharyngis laterally up to the mucosa. Length approx. 3 - 3.5 cm caudally. Subsequent insertion of an 8 mm Provox prosthesis at the typical site without complications. Then closure of the pharynx with the first layer of mucosa-inverting sutures using 4-0 or 3-0 Vicryl single-button sutures. A further layer is placed over this, also inverting with 4-0 or 3-0 Vicryl single button sutures. A third layer can be sutured in the caudal and cranial region, which is not possible in the medial part due to the resection of the hypopharyngeal muscle. The nasogastric tube inserted at the beginning of the operation serves as a splint. The remainder of the infrahyoid musculature is sutured caudally via the pharyngo-oesophageal junction. The site is then irrigated and the bleeding carefully stopped. No bleeding at the end of the operation. Layered closure of the neck wound with insertion of a Redon drain on both sides and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Insertion of a 9 mm tracheostomy tube. Application of a pressure bandage. Completion of the procedure without complications. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist. Patient is extubated and transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring for 1 - 2 days. Overall cT4a hypopharyngeal carcinoma, whereby not the tumor size but the infiltration into the region between the arytenoid cartilage, cricoid cartilage and thyroid cartilage was decisive for the indication for laryngectomy. Please continue postoperative antibiotics with Unacid as already started intraoperatively. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube for 10 days, then X-ray pre-swallow and, if necessary, diet build-up. Wait for the final histology and discuss the further procedure in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, PEG placement, Tracheotomy

Then advance the 0° telescope through the glottic plane into the trachea. This is very difficult due to the exophytic tumor. Finally, however, the trachea and the bronchial system can be inspected up to the exit of the segmental bronchi. The mucosal conditions here are unremarkable. Intubation of the patient by the anesthetist. Inspection of the subglottis, glottis and supraglottis. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions on all sides.

Medially, the base of the tongue is reached, but is obviously not clinically infiltrated. Now advance the esophagoscope into the stomach. No evidence of malignant mucosal changes in the area of the esophagus. Now inspection of the oral cavity. Inconspicuous mucosal conditions. Pulling up the soft palate. No pathological changes here either. Now adjustment of the oropharynx and hypopharynx using the Lawson retractor. This shows the described space requirement, which is very difficult to adjust due to difficult mouth opening. Once the ............................... has been satisfactorily adjusted, laser resection can begin. This involves cutting around the tumour in the area of the lower tonsil pole and gradually mobilizing it. Due to the size of the tumor, it is not possible to remove it in its entirety in one piece; the tumor must be divided. In this case, it is also necessary to move the barring device and insert another barring device (spreading laryngoscope). This allows the tumor to be resected step by step, with the tumor resection extending in the area of the lateral pharyngeal wall towards the base of the tongue and reaching just above the piriform sinus on the left side. Removal of several marginal samples. These marginal samples are found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. Careful hemostasis and completion of the procedure. Further procedure depending on the histology. Final discussion with the anesthesiologist, in the sense of a consultation. The patient is transferred to the recovery ward.","Endoral laser resection and Panendoscopy

A strongly exophytic tumor of the left vocal fold can now be seen, which is limited to the left vocal fold but extends into the anterior commissure. The patient can be positioned relatively well so that there is a good overview of the tumor. Microlaryngoscopic laser ablation of the tumor is now performed. This begins dorsally with a safety margin of around 1-2 mm. In the lateral removal area, it extends deep into the vocalis muscle. The resection is performed anteriorly, where the tumor is dissected from the inner surface of the laryngeal cartilage and removed with the laser. The cartilage surface appears smooth and inconspicuous. The tumor extends a little way into the subglottic area, so that an appropriate safety margin of 2 mm must be maintained on the subglottic slope. Careful hemostasis is then performed. Take representative samples in the area of the anterior commissure as well as at the caudal margin. These are assessed intraoperatively as tumor-free by the pathologist. The lateral cranial and dorsal settling area was macroscopically safe in sano. After repeated careful hemostasis, with dry wound conditions, removal of all instruments.

The above-mentioned operation was therefore indicated. To be on the safe side, the patient was also informed about flap coverage in the event of a very large neck metastasis.","First, oral cavity inspection again. Pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The relatively inconspicuous and flat tumor is seen in the area of the tonsil lobe, which is also somewhat hardened. No growth in the tonsillar lobe. Tumor also well mobile. Indication for surgery therefore given. PEG insertion: insertion of the flexible esophagoscope, after creation of the diaphanoscopy insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube without complications. Fixation to the abdominal wall in the typical manner. Now first insertion of the Mc Ivor blade. The tumor is incised with a safety margin of at least 1 cm on all sides, also in depth. The anterior palatal arch, the tonsil and parts of the base of the tongue and the glossotonsillar groove are removed. The posterior palatal arch remains almost intact. The specimen is removed, thread-marked and sent for frozen section. Tumor-free on all sides in the frozen section. Thus R0 situation with regard to the primary tumor. Careful hemostasis. Now repositioning for neck dissection on both sides and tracheotomy. Beginning with neck dissection on the right: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The mass is located cranially and is relatively difficult to move. Infiltration into the soft tissue is to be expected here. As the dissection progresses, it becomes apparent that the mass is growing up to the lower tonsil pole, which is also resected. Also infiltration of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein and parts of the branches of the cervical plexus. First presentation of the omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. The latter must be resected laterally as it is infiltrated. Visualization of the internal jugular vein. It can be visualized caudally, cranially it is clearly infiltrated by the tumor. Depiction of the internal and external carotid artery. The external artery is infiltrated at its outlets. The branches are successively dissected and ligated. The course of the external artery can be preserved up to the parotid gland. The superficial temporal vein is ligated. The facial vein is also ligated. In the area of the bulb and the internal carotid artery, the lymph node conglomerate lies close to these structures. Difficult dissection of the internal carotid artery, which is exposed up to the base of the skull in order to dissect the tumor. However, this is completely successful. No evidence of real infiltration of the wall. Clear tumor infiltration in the area of the hypoglossus, which is also resected. The vagus nerve is also located in the tumor conglomerate and is also thickened. Therefore co-resection. Also resection of the accessorius nerve. Upper parts of the cervical plexus branches must also be partially resected. The phrenic nerve can be preserved, as can the lower parts which extend supraclavicularly. In addition to the large lymph node conglomerate, there are multiple other lymph nodes between the branches of the cervical plexus. A resection up to level Vb and level IIb followed, with complete removal of levels II to V. In the course of the procedure, the caudal parotid pole was resected to confirm a resection in healthy tissue. This also included visualization of the oral branch, which can be preserved. Also marginal samples from the cranial accessorius and vagus area. These marginal samples are healthy. Overall, however, in addition to the large lymph node metastasis conglomerate with clear soft tissue infiltration, multiple metastases level II, III, IV, V. Careful hemostasis, irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer's solution. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain. Due to the extensive metastasis in the neck region on the right, neck dissection on the left is now indicated. Tracheotomy also indicated due to the extensive resection of the important structures on the right side of the neck. Left neck dissection and tracheotomy (<CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME>). Marking of the planned skin incision on the left, curving from mastoid to caudal along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid. Marking of mandibular angle and mandibular branch. Skin incision using a scalpel through the subcutaneous tissue and platysma. Separation of the platysma. Development of a skin flap by successive dissection along the platysma. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid anterior margin. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, the accessorius nerve. Exposure and dissection of the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the anterior posterior digastric venter. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure of the ansa, free preparation of the internal jugular vein and the facial vein as well as other outlets to obtain venous drainage. Development of the medial neck preparation and resection of the same. The superior thyroid artery cannot be spared here; it is ligated and clipped. Now dissect the lateral neck specimen. To do this, expose the common carotid artery and the vagus. Dissection from caudal to cranial, taking level V to Ib. The ansa is visualized as well as the plexus, which is spared. No evidence of hilar fistula. Removal of the neck preparation. Hemostasis, irrigation with H202 and Ringer. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon. Two-layer wound closure. Subsequent tracheotomy. For this purpose, marking of the skin incision 1 QF below the cricoid cartilage, skin incision of approx. 3 cm, dissection through cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue, ligation of larger caliber veins. Exposure of the linea alba and pushing the infrahyoid muscles to the side. Dissection on the cricoid cartilage. Exposure of the anterior surface of the trachea. Exposure of the narrow glandular isthmus, which is undermined and extensively bipolarized. Truncus brachiocephalicus is not palpable. Now create a Björk flap between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp, this is successful without any problems. Suturing of the same using a total of 5 stoma sutures. Insertion of an 8 mm cannula and problem-free reintubation. Re-inspection of the right neck, here again bipolar coagulation. Irrigation with H202. Insertion of a 10-gauge Redon and two-layer wound closure. Finally, cT1-2 tonsillar carcinoma removed in healthy tissue. Extensive neck metastasis on the right with multiple metastases under a very large metastatic conglomerate. Postoperatively, the patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for one night for monitoring. Please continue antibiotics started intraoperatively. Plan further procedure after receiving the final histology. RCT is most likely indicated.","Transoral tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Tracheotomy

Marking of the planned incision. Sharp cutting of the cutis and subcutis. Expose the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Overall, there is pronounced metastasis, especially in levels II and III. The posterior digastric venter muscle cannot be visualized initially due to the extensive metastatic conglomerate. Therefore turn to visualization of the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection of the internal jugular vein, the venous angle and the common carotid artery, the bifurcation and the internal/external carotid artery. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and successive detachment of the metastatic conglomerate from the digastric muscle. Relocation and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the accessorius nerve in the sense of neurolysis. In level II b, the metastases extend far to the cranial side. Successive development of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the accessory nerve and the plexus branches. Clearing of levels II b, II a, III, IV as well as V. Level IV also shows a clearly enlarged lymph node, which however could also be reactively altered by the previous operation. Then turn to the medial neck preparation. Successive detachment of a large metastasis located in the venous angle. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and protection of the same. Displacement and, at the end of the operation, re-embedding of the hypoglossal nerve in the sense of neurolysis. Here too, the metastasis extends far to the cranial side. However, the oral branch can be stimulated in depth with the help of stimulation. Ultimately, the medial neck preparation can also be completely developed. At the end of the operation, the wound was dry on all sides. Levels I b, II a, II b, III, IV and V were evacuated. The wound cavity was rinsed with H2O2 and Ringer's solution. Insertion of a 10 Redon drain. Subcutaneous suturing with Vicryl 4.0 and skin suturing with Ethilon 5.0. Application of a wound and pressure dressing. Completion of the operation without complications. Final consultation with the anesthesiologist. The patient received 3 g Unacid intraoperatively as a single shot antibiotic. Conclusion: CUP panendoscopy and right neck dissection in 5 regions. Overall extensive right cervical metastasis. Further procedure after receipt of the definitive histology.","CUP Panendoscopy, Neck dissection on the right (Level I-V), Tonsillectomy; PEG placement

The PET-CT showed increased FTG storage in the area of the left tonsil, so a panendoscopy with left tonsillectomy and, if necessary, CUP panendoscopy was indicated. A detailed preoperative discussion was held with the patient and his <CLINICIAN_NAME> about the planned procedure and there was ample opportunity to ask questions.","First induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. Then rigid tracheoscopy with the O° scope by the surgeon. The trachea is free and non-irritated up to the carina with inconspicuous mucosa. Intubation by the anesthesia colleagues and then insertion of the Mc Ivor mouth blocker. Palpation of the tonsilloliths on both sides. Small palatine tonsils can be seen on both sides, with the left tonsil in the upper pole being slightly indurated in comparison to the sides. Demonstration of the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME> and determination of the procedure. Tonsillectomy on the left should be performed first, followed by a frozen section. Subsequently, panendoscopy and nasopharyngeal curettage and removal of tongue base biopsies with clinically largely unremarkable left tonsil. Approach for left tonsillectomy: Exposure of the upper pole of the tonsil. The tonsil is successively and completely removed with bipolar and scissors. The posterior palatal arch is left completely intact. Laterally, the tonsil is released quite generously and caudally it is separated with the bipolar and scissors. The suture markings are made cranially and laterally. At the transition to the base of the tongue in the glossotonsillar groove, individual lymph follicles are still visible, which cannot be clearly assigned to the tonsil; these are resected separately with bipolar and scissors and submitted as histology glossotonsillar groove for frozen section assessment. There is no relevant bleeding after the tonsillectomy. Removal of the oral retractor and insertion of the flexible esophagogastroscope into the stomach in the typical manner. The gastric mucosa is completely free of irritation up to the pylorus and with inversion in the area of the cardia. Then carefully withdraw the esophagoscope with constant air insufflation. From 40 to 43 cm tooth row there are isolated erosions and at 42 cm from the tooth row a spherical exophytic, but overall smoothly limited mass. Demonstration of the findings to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who recommends taking a forceps biopsy. Now advance the forceps over the working channel and take 3 representative samples from the exophytic mass. Finally, there is no relevant bleeding. Further retraction of the esophagoscope. Further cranial than 40 cm from the tooth row, the mucosa is completely normal and smooth. Now insert a mouth guard and inspect the rest of the oropharynx. The posterior and lateral walls of the oropharynx are free, as are the valleculae, the base of the tongue, which is symmetrically slightly hyperplastic, the lateral walls of the hypopharynx, the posterior wall of the hypopharynx and both piriform sinuses are free and can be freely unfolded. The esophageal inlet can also be freely unfolded with inconspicuous mucosal conditions. Direct laryngoscopy reveals an inconspicuous posterior and anterior commissure, the interary area is clear, as are the folds of the pouch, the morgue sinus and the vocal folds. The Mc Ivor mouth retractor is now inserted again and a velotractio is inserted on both sides. In the nasopharynx, slightly left-accentuated minor adenoids are seen, which are curetted out with the Beckmann ring knife under vision and sent for final histology. Finally, hemostasis with the bipolar. Removal of the mouth guard and insertion of the mouth guard and insertion of the Kleinsasser B-tube for re-inspection of the base of the tongue. There are no abnormalities here. Decision to take 2 representative samples each from the middle of the tongue base and the right and left sides. Final hemostasis with the monopolar. The frozen section result of <CLINICIAN_NAME> is now transmitted. It shows a basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil, which was resected practically on all sides R1. Discussion of the findings with <CLINICIAN_NAME> and acceptance of the operation by <CLINICIAN_NAME> for resection. This is done using the monopolar knife, bipolar and scissors. The resected specimen and representative marginal samples are submitted for final histology. The gl. submandibularis is now exposed laterocaudally. Final hemostasis with the bipolar. Removal of the swabs from the nasopharynx and, after re-inspection of the tonsil larynx and nasopharynx, termination of the operation with absolute hemostasis. Conclusion: V.a. cT2 cN1 basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil. After receipt of the final histology, neck dissection of the left side and PEG placement must definitely be planned with regard to an upcoming adjuvant radiochemotherapy. Please also note the histology from the esophageal mass 42 cm from the ZR. Depending on the final R status and swallowing function, a further resection and/or radial flap coverage must also be considered. According to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, flap coverage is required in the case of an R1 situation towards the palatal arch, medially and laterally. If there is an R1 situation towards the base of the tongue, another transoral resection could be performed.","Tumor-tonsillectomy, Panendoscopy, PE's

The tonsils can be palpated on the right side. There is a hard tumor submucosally. Tumor resection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who first begins the resection with the electric needle right next to the uvula on the anterior palatal arch. Part of the anterior palatal arch is removed. Then transition to the lateral pharyngeal wall and dissection of the tonsil, including a small muscular cuff. The base of the tongue itself is free and does not need to be resected. A portion of the posterior palatal arch can be left. The preparation is thread-marked for the frozen section. In the area of the anterior palatal arch, a marginal sample is taken directly after the tumor resection, which is also thread-marked and sent for histology. The pathologists still found tumor cells in the basal area, so a generous resection is performed in the area of the anterior palatal arch, the lateral pharyngeal wall and the basal tonsillar lobe area. No further resection is possible here, as small areas of fat from the neck are already visible. However, the resected area is tumor-free. Then neck dissection on the left side. Skin incision in the usual manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the accessory muscle, then the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Evacuation of levels II, III and IV. Intraoperatively, the decision is made to also evacuate level V, as there are some visible lymph nodes here. Neck dissection on the right side. After discussion with <CLINICIAN_NAME>, the decision was made to perform a neck dissection on the right side. However, to proceed very carefully in the area of the submandibular gland so as not to produce a fistula. Skin incision in the usual manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle anterior margin, exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Then explore the submandibular gland, proceeding with extreme caution so that the gland is not completely dislocated. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Very careful dissection here too. Free dissection of the internal jugular vein. Level II shows a soft, cystic mass, which initially does not look metastatic; from the macroscopic aspect it could be a cystadenolymphoma of the parotid gland or a lymphangioma, which is demonstrated intraoperatively to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. He recommends removing this mass anyway. To do this, the skin incision is widened slightly and the mass is removed completely. Then clearing out level IIa to Va while sparing the accessorius nerve and the plexus branches. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve, which can also be preserved. Then perform a tracheotomy. Skin incision in the usual manner. Dissection down to the musculature. Push the muscles to the side in the midline. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, which is very small and can be coagulated and transected in a bipolar fashion. Exposure of the trachea. Entering the trachea between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage. Creation of a visor tracheotomy. Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis and insertion of a size 8 tracheal cannula. Continue antibiotics postoperatively. No oral food on the day of surgery. On the next day, please demonstrate to the surgeon; fluids can probably already be started. Otherwise, present the patient to the tumor conference.","Tumor resection, Functional neck dissection, Tracheotomy

After positioning the larynx with the Weerda laryngoscope, the epiglottis is first cut at the transition from the lateral to the medial third and followed into the vallecula at an appropriate safety distance from the tumor. The tumor is then removed caudally and medially from the upper edge of the arytenoid cartilage, which is exposed in its upper third. The tumor is then resected dorsally along the supraglottis. Resection then begins from the lateral hypopharyngeal wall with an appropriate safety distance to the tumor. The resection is then continued cranially in the direction of the vallecula and joined with the incision from the base of the epiglottis. Finally, the tumor is also completely removed caudally, leaving out the tip of the piriform sinus. The specimen is then thread-marked and mounted on cork and sent to the pathology department for frozen section histology. Here, all marginal incisions as well as the one incision from the base of the tumor are found to be tumor-free. Finally, careful hemostasis by monopolar coagulation in the resection area. This involved clipping a small arterial branch in the lateral pharyngeal wall. Now insertion of a gastric tube under visualization, the correct position of which is also checked and confirmed by auscultation. Then transition to neck dissection on the right side. After a skin incision in the area of the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, regions II to V are successively removed. All non-lymphatic structures are spared and remain intact. Once the neck dissection preparation has been removed, careful hemostasis is performed. Insertion of a Redon suction drain. Two-layer wound closure. Subsequent transition to the left side. Similar procedure here. Here too, regions II to V are successively evacuated while preserving all non-lymphatic structures. There is no indication of a lymph node metastasis. Insertion of a Redon suction drain and subsequent wound closure. The surgical site was then checked. This revealed the now quite large resection area on the left side. The decision was therefore made to perform a protective tracheostomy. A transverse skin incision about 3 cm long was made and the linea alba was dissected. Dissection of the straight neck muscles with exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed under the pretracheal lamina, clamped and stitched around. This exposes the upper trachea. Entrance between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal clasp in the sense of a visual tracheostomy. Placement of 2 upper and 2 lower sutures for the mucocutaneous anastomosis. Subsequently, the patient was reintubated onto an 8-gauge tracheostomy tube without any problems. Sterile wound dressing. Transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Transoral laser-surgical partial laryngeal/pharyngeal resection for a carcinoma of the aryepiglottic fold. Selective neck dissection of regions II to V on both sides.

Opening of the ligamentum conicum in the sense of a transverse incision. Opening of the thyroid cartilage in the midline with the wheel. Insertion of the retractors. It can be seen that the tumor reaches right up to the anterior commissure, but does not appear to exceed it. The anterior commissure has thus been opened beyond the tumor. Nevertheless, a marginal sample was taken from the left anterior commissure. Subsequent re-inspection of the tumor. This is easily displaceable in relation to the thyroid cartilage. Therefore, the tumor, which reaches the vocal process here and can be removed there, was cut around. In the upper area, the tumor does not reach the pocket fold. Only slight infiltration of the subglottic slope towards the lower margin. The tumor is macroscopically resected in sano on all sides. Removal of marginal samples from the upper and lower margins of the deposit as well as separately from the front and deep front.

Turning to the neck dissection of the right side: Here, the perforated skin area is cut around in a spindle shape. Release of the skin. Subcutaneous, extensive inflammatory surrounding of the metastasis is also seen later, so that the skin resection must be extended here, with no clear distinction between tumor and inflammatory events. Widen the skin incision caudally. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle cranially on the mastoid and caudally. Widespread infiltration of the muscle. It is therefore cut at its insertion and origins. Visualization of the omohyoid muscle. Clearly inflammatory scarring in the direction of the submandibular gland. However, this is not infiltrated. Release of the capsule. Exposure of the digastric muscle. This is also resected if adherent to the metastasis. Infiltration and consumption of the accessorius nerve. This is not exposed. The internal jugular vein, vagus nerve and common carotid artery are visualized caudally. At the level of the metastatic conglomerate, the vein is infiltrated and thrombosed cranially. For this reason, the vein is removed caudally. Preservation of the common carotid artery and the hypoglossal nerve. Separation of the occipital and facial arteries. Partial resection of the cervical plexus. No further metastasis in the direction of level Vb. Overall, however, complete resection of the right cervical draining veins due to the extent of the tumor. Resection of the metastatic conglomerate and the attached neck preparation in toto. After removal, there is now a defect measuring approx. 3 cm to the primary tumor region. Therefore, blunt opening is performed here with a clear indication for defect reconstruction due to the pharyngocutaneous fistula. Due to the resected superficial and deep veins on the right side, there is no possibility of a microvascular connection here. Therefore, the indication is for defect coverage using a pedicled supraclavicular island flap. If there is good skin mobility here, the defect is measured. An area measuring 8x5 cm is then incised in a spindle shape. Resection down to the muscle fascia. Removal of the muscle fascia. Release of the tissue at the acromion and isolation of the supplying vascular area from the transversa colli artery, which could already be identified by Doppler sonography before lifting the flap. Release on all sides of the trapezius muscle at the clavicle, so that a well mobile pedicle can be developed overall, with completely tension-free insertion into the oral cavity. Prior to this, the skin incision was widened and the skin dissected. Insertion of the flap into the oral cavity and successive suturing. Subsequently, tight conditions on all sides with a vital flap and overall sufficient reconstruction. The wound is then irrigated on the right cervical side. If the wound is dry, insertion of two 10-gauge Redon drains. Careful two-layer wound closure. Neck dissection of the left side was performed at the same time as defect reconstruction: skin incision on the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, submandibular gland and digastric muscle. Clearing of levels II to Va and preservation of the facial vein, superior thyroid artery, accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve and cervical plexus branches. Exposure and preservation of the vagus nerve and common carotid artery. Overall, no macroscopically highly visible nodes. Subsequent wound irrigation and inspection. If the wound is dry, insertion of a 10-gauge Redon drain. Careful two-layer wound closure. Due to the extent of the procedure, a final protective tracheotomy is performed: incision at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Skin incision. Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and the anterior surface of the trachea, after separation of the infrahyoid muscles. Exposure and transection of the thyroid isthmus. Entering the trachea. Widening by performing a visor tracheostomy and then successive incision of the tracheostoma. Subsequent easy transfer to a size 8 low-cuff cannula, which is suture-fixed. Subsequent enoral inspection and, if the graft was vital, completion of the procedure without any indication of complications. The patient received intraoperative intravenous antibiotics with Unacid 3 g. Please continue this for 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusion: Intraoperative R0-resected cT2 cN2b-cN3 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right. Please feed via the PEG tube for 7 days. Subsequently, with regular enoral healing and flap perfusion, gradual diet build-up. This should be functionally possible. Subsequently, prompt recanalization should be possible.

Performance of the tracheotomy by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Horizontal skin incision, approx. 5 cm in length, along an old scar following thyroid surgery. Sharp cutting of the skin, subcutaneous tissue and parts of the platysma. Dissection in depth in the direction of the infrahyoid muscles. The infrahyoid musculature is exposed and cut in the midline. Cricoid cartilage is palpated. No residual thyroid tissue is visible. Only scarring between the musculature and the trachea. The scarred tissue below the musculature is removed with pointed scissors and bipolarized. Ultimately, the trachea is well exposed. The trachea is cut open between the 3rd and 4th tracheal clasp. Creation of a Björk flap with anticipated laryngectomy and reintubation of the patient. Lifting of the apron flap by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Sharp transection of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma and elevation of the skin-platysma flap in a typical manner to just above the hyoid bone. The submandibular gland is exposed on both sides and the apron flap is fixed using a chain dog. Neck dissection on the left: Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, the posterior belly of the digaster muscle, the left submandibular gland and the accessorius nerve. The cervical vascular sheath is shown. The anterior neck preparation is removed for the first time between the V. jugularis interna and V. facialis and M. omohyoideus. There are two large metastases on the internal jugular vein at level IIa. In order to gain an overview, the decision is made to remove level II b completely. This can also be done without any problems while sparing the accessorius nerve. Removal of levels III to V with protection of the plexus branches, after visualization of the vagus nerve, the internal carotid artery and the common carotid artery. Approach to level II further on the left side. Careful dissection of the two metastases from the jugular vein. Ultimately, the metastases can be removed without obstructing the jugular vein. Targeted hemostasis. This is a left neck dissection with complete evacuation of level II to V. In the case of macroscopic evidence of two metastases in level II a on the left side. Carry out the neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle, the posterior belly of the digaster muscle, the left submandibular gland and the accessorius nerve. The cervical vascular sheath is shown. The anterior neck preparation is removed for the first time between the internal jugular vein and facial vein and the omohyoid muscle. Level IIb is then removed above the accessorius nerve. Release of the lateral neck preparation while sparing the plexus branches and the hypoglossal nerve. The branches of the superior thyroid artery as well as the lingual and facial arteries are dissected for a possible anastomosis. Subtle hemostasis. Release of the larynx by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Detachment of the infrahyoid muscles for this purpose. Removal of the hyoid bone. Removal of the oblique laryngeal musculature and exposure of the thyroid cartilage on the right side. Then detachment of the piriform sinus on the right side. Exposure and detachment of the thyroid gland on both sides. On the left side, the piriform sinus cannot be detached due to infiltration of the thyroid cartilage. Enter with the McIVOR oral spatula and start with tumor resection at the lower tonsil pole with the monopolar needle and at the posterior palatal arch. The soft palate is also affected and must be partially resected. Then enter the pharynx from the neck. On the right side, disluxation of the epiglottis. Incision of the mucosa along the edge of the epiglottis up to the right arytenoid cartilage. It then becomes apparent that the tumor fills the entire piriform sinus, goes down to the esophageal entrance and infiltrates the medial wall and the thyroid cartilage. The tumor is cut around with a safety margin of 1.5 cm and the larynx is placed below the cricoid cartilage and marked with a suture. Unfortunately, the vocal folds could not be preserved for the laboratory as the larynx was accidentally placed in formalin by the nursing staff. Then marginal samples were taken. All marginal samples are tumor-free in the frozen section and free of carcinoma in situ. Measurement of the defect. The defect is 15 x 10 cm in size and extends from the tonsil region across the base of the tongue via the pharynx to the entrance to the esophagus. Decision to remove a transplant. The anterolateral thigh graft is suitable for this. Lifting of the anterolateral thigh graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. To do this, draw a line between the lateral edge of the patella and the anterior superior iliac spine. Doppler the perforator vessels on this line. Five perforator vessels are identified and the graft is designed around the perforator vessels, 16 x 10 cm. Primary wound closure is still possible. Incision of the graft at the inferior medial edge. Expose and identify the rectus femoris muscle with its median fascia. Then identify the vastus lateralis muscle and enter the sulcus between these two muscles and identify the descending ramus of the circumflex femoral artery. The vastus lateralis is relatively thin, so that a delicate perforator graft is not lifted here and part of the vastus lateralis muscle is also lifted. Then set down. Then dissection of the pedicle and removal of the graft so that two veins remain, one large and one small. Undermining of the skin. Insertion of two Redon drains and cutting of Burow triangles and multi-layer wound closure in the usual manner. The graft is flushed with heparin and handed over to <CLINICIAN_NAME>, who then sutures the graft into the pharynx in two layers. The vascular anastomosis is performed between the facial vein and an outlet from the facial vein. The artery is connected to the common outlet of the facial and lingual arteries. There is very good graft perforation. The graft can be controlled transorally as it goes up into the tonsillar lobes. Two-layer wound closure after insertion of a flap and a Redon drainage. After the laryngectomy, a size 8 Provox-Vega prosthesis was inserted. The patient is ventilated in the intensive care unit and should be on antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Flap checks according to the usual schedule. Completion of the procedure without complications.","Partial pharyngectomy, LE, Neck dissection, Tracheotomy, Defect coverage (ALT flap)

Typical fixation to the abdominal wall. Subsequent repositioning for laser resection: insertion with the spreading laryngoscope. Exposure of the tumor, which is successful. Using the CO2 laser with a power of 5-7 watts, the tumor is successively cut around the healthy tissue. In the caudal-medial area, a small mucosal change is seen, which is also suspicious and is about 1 cm away from the main tumor. This is included in the resection. The specimen is then removed and thread-marked and sent for frozen section. A medial margin sample is also taken and sent for frozen section. Medial margin specimen with at least moderate dysplasia according to pathology. Therefore resection recommended. Relatively scarce in the main preparation after basal, although there were microscopically good margins here. Post-resection also recommended here. Therefore, another resection is recommended.

In the course of a panendoscopy, a cT1 cN2a G3 differentiated oropharyngeal carcinoma was histologically confirmed. There is now an indication for transoral resection, neck dissection and PEG placement. The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions about the procedure before the operation.","After active patient identification, the patient is brought into the operating theater. Team time-out and induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. The oropharyngoscopy is performed first. This reveals the tumor described above, which appears to be located in the area of the glossotonsillar groove. Ventral extension to the middle third of the anterior palatal arch. Subsequently transition to the glossotonsillar groove and into the base of the tongue. The tumor is relatively difficult to palpate as it grows largely submucosally in the area of the base of the tongue. Transition to PEG placement. The endoscope is inserted under visualization and air is constantly insufflated into the stomach. Here the gastric mucosa is inconspicuous on all sides. After a clear positive diaphanoscopy, the PEG tube is inserted using the thread pull-through method in the typical manner. This was performed without any problems. The patient was given 3 g Unacid preoperatively. The patient was then repositioned for transoral tumor resection. Insertion of the self-retaining Jennings retractor and suturing of the tongue. Luxation of the tongue and renewed palpatory identification of the tumor borders. Start of resection in the area of the anterior palatal arch with the electric needle. Resection down to the tonsil. As the tumor extensions are relatively close to the tonsil tissue, the decision is made to resect the tonsil en bloc as well. With constant palpatory identification of the tumor borders, the tumor is successively resected with a clinically macroscopically wide safety margin. In between, bipolar coagulation of small arterial bleedings is performed. The suture marking of the primary tumor is still performed in situ. The anterior margin of the posterior third of the tongue and the glossotonsillar groove as well as the margin of the anterior palatal arch and the medial base of the tongue are marked with sutures. Hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation. Insertion of an H2O2-soaked hydrogen compress. In the meantime, the specimen has been sent for frozen section diagnostics. Repositioning of the patient for neck dissection. Superficial skin disinfection and sterile draping. Mark the planned incision from preauricular to infrolobular and curved towards the caudal side in a bayonet shape in the area of the sternocleidomastoid muscle anterior margin. Sharp transection of the cutis and subcutis. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure and initial protection of the auricularis magnus nerve. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle as the cranial border as well as the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle as the cranial border. Turn to the cervical vascular sheath. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and the external and internal carotid arteries. Level II shows that the tumor infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid broadly. The decision was therefore made to resect the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is done using the electric knife, initially caudally. Cranially, the metastatic conglomerate is firmly seated in level II b and appears to infiltrate the caudal parotid pole. The tumor extensions reach up to the carotid bifurcation. However, the tumor can be separated from the external carotid artery and the first branches as well as the internal carotid artery with the Reynold scissors. Exposure and protection of the vagus nerve. It is also apparent that the internal jugular vein is infiltrated cranially by the tumor. It was therefore decided to remove it as well. Double ligation of the same caudally and single ligation cranially. The tumor extends cranially under the digastric muscle. Therefore, removal of the same and lateral beating of the muscle belly. You now have a good view of the internal carotid artery and all external branches. Expose the superior thyroid artery, the lingual artery, the facial artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery. As the tumor also infiltrates the caudal parotid pole, the incision is extended cranially to secure the marginal ramus and the glandular capsule is exposed. Expose the cartilaginous pointer and the main facial trunk. Subsequently, successive dissection along the main trunk and exposure of the frontofacial and cervicofacial bundle. The cervicofacial bundle is dissected further into the periphery, carefully monitoring the marginal ramus. The laterocaudal part of the parotid gland is then removed while sparing the marginal mandibular nerve. The digastric muscle is also dissected dorsally. The same applies to the accessorius nerve, which is also located in the tumor conglomerate. After laborious dissection, the metastatic block can be removed in toto. Only in the area of the carotid bifurcation does a tumor remnant still appear to be present macroscopically. Therefore, meticulous dissection along the vessels and removal of the questionably infiltrated material. Despite the preoperatively small tumor extension, the tumor appears to grow diffusely infiltrating intraoperatively. The dissection extends as far as the pharyngeal musculature. No macroscopic tumor remnants here. Subsequent removal of the remaining medial and lateral neck specimen. Overall removal of levels II to V. Hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Wound irrigation with H2O2 and NACL. Insertion of a Redon drainage as well as subcutaneous suture and skin suture. Application of a wound dressing. In the meantime, rapid incision announcement by telephone. Microscopic suspicion of R1 status in the area of the wound bed at the anterior margin of the posterior third of the tongue. The patient is therefore repositioned for transoral resection. The complete wound bed is resected and sent for definitive histology (resection of the wound bed of the posterior third of the tongue at the front and resection of the wound bed of the posterior third of the tongue at the back). Subsequently, definitive marginal samples were taken in the area of the wound bed (posterior third of the tongue at the front, posterior third of the tongue at the back). Extensive hemostasis using bipolar coagulation. Transfer of the patient intubated and ventilated to the local intensive care unit, as a tracheotomy had not been discussed and planned with the patient in advance. The operation was completed without complications. Conclusion: Due to the extensive and diffuse tumor growth, the patient should be advised to undergo adjuvant radiochemotherapy postoperatively.

Long-distance dissection of the accessorius nerve and neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the nerve. Then remove the lateral neck preparation in accordance with levels II, III and some IV. Now dissection of the vein angle and level I b. Here, also long-distance dissection of the hypoglossal nerve, which is preserved together with the ansa. Here, too, neurolysis, displacement and re-embedding of the nerve. Preservation of the facial vein. Then complete removal of the anterior neck preparation with all outlets, the internal jugular vein and external carotid artery. The thyroid vein originates from the facial vein. The entire vascular-nerve bundle is also gently dissected and preserved here. Then careful hemostasis. Insertion of a Redon drain. Then two-layer wound closure and dressing. After completion of the procedure and also at the beginning of the procedure, consultation with the anesthesia colleagues. A decision was then made to transfer the patient to the ENT intensive care unit for monitoring.","Partial glossectomy, Neck dissection

Previous endoscopy described as cT1 findings. Now again, before planned transoral or laser resection, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The relatively small exophytic tumor at the lateral base of the tongue on the right side extending to the lateral pharyngeal wall is seen. However, there are now also changes in the area of the lower tonsil pole and in the direction of the hypopharynx, which are suspicious. Overall, however, macroscopically rather small findings. Due to the somewhat more extensive findings after the initial endoscopy, the tumor was now resected with a larger safety margin.","First insert the McIVOR spatula. The tongue and the base of the tongue can be visualized well here, as can the tonsil region and the transition to the alveolar ridge. Cut around the tumor macroscopically with a safety margin of at least 1-1.5 cm on all sides. The tonsil is removed in its entirety. Resection extends over the lateral area of the glossotonsillar or glossoalveolar junction into the base of the tongue. A slightly deeper resection is performed in the base of the tongue if the main tumor is present. The base of the tongue is removed up to the vallecula and the border of the epiglottis or up to the beginning of the hypopharynx. The entire specimen is thread-marked. Due to the somewhat smaller macroscopic distances in the area of the vallecula, base of the tongue and epiglottis, a further marginal sample is taken here, which extends over the base of the tongue, the vallecula to the epiglottis and to the edge of the transition to the hypopharynx. The frozen section still shows in-situ infiltrates caudally at the transition to the hypopharynx and in the area of the caudal tongue base, vallecula and epiglottis. For this reason, another extensive resection is performed with the laser in the hypopharyngeal region: After the tumor has been adjusted, a large, at least 1-1.5 cm wide resected hypopharyngeal mucosa is removed with a 5 watt continuous wave superpulse. A marginal sample is then taken from the entire hypopharyngeal area up to the edge of the larynx or epiglottis. The entire mucosa of the lingual epiglottis up to the edge of the epiglottis is removed from the vallecula area up to the lateral border of the epiglottis. Another strip of mucosa is removed from the vallecula-epiglottis area as a marginal sample, whereby mucosa is now also removed from the front of the epiglottis. The mucosal resection again extends medially to the beginning of the hypopharyngeal inlet. Then, after insertion of the FK blocker, a superficial strip of the entire medially resected tongue base up to the vallecula is obtained as a post-resectate and then another strip as a marginal sample. All three marginal samples are sent in. No more tomorin infiltrates here, so now R0 resection. Overall relatively extensive tumor, but mostly growing superficially. Neck dissection can therefore be performed. Neck dissection is now performed on the right side: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. Depiction of the internal jugular vein, internal/external carotid artery. Exposure of the vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. Removal of the lymph nodes from levels II to V, preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Several conspicuous lymph nodes are visible, especially in level II. Dissection somewhat more difficult due to the previous operation in which a lymph node extirpation was performed. Neck dissection on the left side: Here, an arched skin incision starting from the mastoid at the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid and bending posteriorly. Exposure of the cervical fascia. Creation of a platysmal flap. Exposure of the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid. Dissection in depth. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Exposure of the submandibular gland. Now dissect in the direction of the digaster muscle. Trace the digaster muscle cranially. The facial vein is exposed here. Trace the facial vein caudally. Expose the internal jugular vein and the cervical vascular sheath. Now successively detach the anterior triangle, which goes to the final histology. Dissection up to the plexus branches. Now detachment of level II a, after exposure of the accessorius nerve. Break through the neck preparation under the nerve. Further dissection caudally. This exposes the hypoglossal nerve. Successive detachment of the neck preparation in levels II a and III and IV. The preparation is sent for final histology. Irrigation with Wassertoff and Ringer. No evidence of further bleeding. Insertion of a 10 redon. Platys suture. Skin suturing and completion of the neck dissection. A tracheotomy was also performed during the operation after it became clear that the operation would be more extensive. Repositioning for tracheotomy. Palpation of the cricoid cartilage. 3 cm long skin incision at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Cut through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. This is split in the middle. Exposure of the anterior surface of the thyroid gland. Tunneling of the thyroid gland on the trachea from the cricoid cartilage caudally. Bipolar coagulation of the thyroid gland and transection of the thyroid isthmus. Exposure of the trachea. Incision between the second and third cartilage clasps with the 15 mm scalpel. Widen the incision so that a sufficiently large tracheotomy is created. Now suture caudally and cranially. The lateral skin ends are closed with skin sutures. Insertion of an LE tube without complications. PEG insertion is necessary if the resection is extended. However, the patient underwent intestinal surgery with insertion of a Vicryl mesh alio loco. The scar extends into the upper abdomen. Mesh insertion was probably also palpated here. Therefore, despite the possibility of diaphanoscopy, a PEG was not inserted. This should be performed by colleagues in internal medicine or surgery. A transnasal feeding tube was inserted for nutrition. The procedure was completed without complications. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Overall extensive tumor, which had only grown superficially in situ. In any case, N2b status on the right. Please continue postoperative antibiotics for one week. Feeding via feeding tube or PEG for approx. 7-8 days, then, depending on swallowing function, cautious diet build-up.

Entry with the Kleinsasser tube and inspection of the tumor. The tumor starts in the area of the soft palate, moves to the tonsillar lobe on the right side, then from the tonsillar lobe to the base of the tongue and into the vallecula, from the vallecula to the epiglottis and from the epiglottis to the pharyngo-epiglottic fold on both sides, but on the right more than on the left, from the pharyngo-epiglottic fold to the pocket fold, on the right more than on the left. Injection and sterile washing and covering. Start with transoral tumor resection in the area of the soft palate. The monopolar needle, bipolar forceps and scissors are used for this. The tumor is released in the area of the soft palate and the tonsil lobe as well as partially at the base of the tongue. This automatically leads to the soft tissues of the neck, then switch to the neck, as the transoral view is no longer available. Now expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Expose the cervical vascular sheath and continue the tumor resection via a pharyngotomy from the outside. The tumor is dislocated outwards using the pull-through technique and resected en bloc on the right side and on the left side, taking two thirds of the hyoid bone and taking the epiglottis, vallecula and partial pocket fold with it. This resulted in a very large defect. The entire supraglottis had to be removed, leaving just the arytenoids on both sides and the vocal fold region. Now joint consideration of the next steps with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Due to the extensive pharyngeal defect and the pending transplant, it does not make sense to preserve the rest of the larynx, as a pronounced permanent aspiration must be assumed. The vocal folds will also no longer be functional due to the narrow resection margins and the suturing to the graft. Hence the decision to remove the rest of the larynx and insert a Provox prosthesis. This is done in the usual way. Measurement of the defect 5 x 8 x 13 cm. The graft is configured in such a way that there is a bulge for the base of the tongue so that there is a sliding surface for tongue mobility later on. The graft is lifted from the forearm in the usual way using <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Lifting of the radialis graft on the left forearm by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Marking of the skin graft on the distal forearm in the presence of <CLINICIAN_NAME>. S-shaped skin incision in the area of the proximal forearm up to the crook of the elbow and incision around the marked radialis graft. Visualization of the superficial venous system in the area of the S-shaped skin incision. A pronounced cephalic vein can be seen, which is traced and visualized from proximal to distal further to the radial flap edge. Dissection of the radial edge of the flap down to the deep forearm fascia and incision of this. Exposure of the external ramus of the radial nerve and protection of the nerve. Exposure of the brachioradialis radialis muscle. Ulnar skin incision down to the deep forearm fascia and incision of the fascia. Subfascial dissection leaving the peritendineum and perimysium intact. Distal skin incision and ligation of the superficial veins. Identification of the radial artery with the accompanying V. comitans. Blunt detachment from the vascular bed and clipping of the distal radial artery stump for approx. 5 minutes. A good perfusion signal is noted during this time. Then decide on distal pedicle transection and vessel ligation. Exposure of the extensor carpi radialis muscle. Dissection of the flap pedicle from the depth with constant hemostasis using vascular clips. The radial nerve can be spared well. Insertion of a retractor between the extensor carpi radialis and brachioradialis muscles. Vessel preparation up to the crook of the elbow. Insertion of <CLINICIAN_NAME> and exposure of the confluence. Separation of the radial artery just before the interosseous artery. Separation of the venous vessels at the superficial and deep venous system. This is followed by removal of an equivalent piece of split skin from the right thigh by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Incision of the split-thickness skin graft in the usual manner. Sterile wound dressing. Application of a dorsal forearm splint. There was always a good perfusion signal during the operation. Neck dissection on both sides parallel to flap elevation. Start on the right side. Free preparation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. The digastric muscle has already been dissected for the tumor resection. The hypoglossal nerve, accessory nerve and plexus branches can be spared. The facial vein cannot be spared. Remove the neck specimen II a to V a en bloc. Then turn to the opposite side. Here too, visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, the accessorius nerve, the hypoglossal nerve and removal of the neck preparation II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches. The facial vein and another caudal vein branch from the internal jugular vein can be preserved here. Dissection and preparation of these two venous outlets and the superior thyroid artery for the flap connection. Suturing of the graft. To do this, start transorally in the area of the soft palate and the edge of the tongue as well as the alveolar ridge, then suture the rest of the graft transcervically. At the end, suture the anastomoses in the usual manner. Microsurgical insertion of two Redon drains and two-layer wound closure. Please continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours.

Now resection of the tongue tumor from the enoral side after insertion of the mouth guard, starting at the tip of the tongue, almost in the median line dorsally with the monopolar. The mass, which on the surface only appears as a small ulcer on the left side between the edge of the tongue and the floor of the mouth, shows extensive infiltrative growth in depth and spherical growth towards the body of the tongue. The tumor is now gradually bypassed dorsally towards the base of the tongue and resection is now performed in the area of the base of the tongue towards the floor of the mouth. Here, the tumor is also bypassed with an appropriate safety margin. The tumor also shows a cone-like growth in depth, which is carefully bypassed and lifted accordingly. The neck is now dissected, first on the left side. To do this, make a skin incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid, ending in a skin fold. Dissection of the platysmal flap and dissection of the sternocleidomastoid anterior edge. Exposure of the vascular nerve sheath and further dissection along the omohyoid muscle to the hyoid bone. Dissection along the digastric muscle towards the base of the skull and removal of levels II, III and IV. Level V is then removed, as there are two macroscopically conspicuous lymph nodes in level IIa. All vascular and nerve structures in the neck area are spared after exposure and re-embedding of nerves X, XI, XII. This is followed by exposure and re-embedding of the marginal ramus and mandibular nerve and dissection and removal of level Ib, including the submandibular gland. This results in a thorough effect in the complete removal of the basal margin of the tumor. The large penetrating defect is used in the further course of the reconstruction, the pedicle pull-through. This is followed by neck dissection on the right side. The skin incision is the same as on the left. Dissection of the platysmal flap and exposure of the vascular nerve sheath. Careful evacuation of level II, III and IV without evidence of macroscopically conspicuous lymph nodes. Redon drainage is inserted here, subcutaneous and skin sutures are used. N. hypoglossus, N. accessorius and N. vagus are exposed and re-embedded. The next step is to lift the forearm graft after carefully measuring the tissue to be lifted. The graft is marked accordingly on the forearm, prepared and lifted from distal to proximal. The lifting ends in the area of the crook of the elbow and the superficial and deep venous system is taken along. The radial ramus superficial nerve is exposed and spared during dissection. The tourniquet is opened and careful hemostasis is performed. The graft is then removed and incorporated enorally to reconstruct the tongue and floor of the mouth. After appropriate incorporation, the vessels are anastomosed in the sense of an end-to-end anastomosis of the superior thyroid artery with the radial artery and end-to-end anastomosis of the flap vein with a branch of the facial vein using a size 3.0 coupler. Checking the vascular flows, which are excellent, and finally subcutaneous sutures and skin sutures here too. The lifting defect in the area of the right forearm is covered with full-thickness skin, which is lifted in the area of the right groin, and partially closed primarily. Application of a vacuum dressing and a Kramer splint to immobilize the forearm. The groin wound is treated with a Redon drain and closed primarily with subcutaneous sutures and skin sutures. After re-inspection of the findings, minimal swelling and a completely clear airway, a tracheostomy is not performed at this stage. This may have to be done secondarily. The vascular signals to be duplicated are drawn in the neck area.","Tongue partial resection, Floor of mouth partial resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage (Radial), Endoscopy

Dissection of the neck specimen along the anterior venter of the digastric muscle and detachment of the specimen up to the hyoid bone. Exposure of the facial vein. Identification of the hypoglossal nerve. The facial vein can be preserved. Sharp dissection on the vein and lateral striking of the neck preparation. The vein can be completely detached from the neck specimen by inserting a .............................. The common carotid artery and vagus nerve are exposed. The neck preparation is now detached from the deep cervical fascia from cranial to caudal. Particular care is taken to spare the deep branches of the cervical plexus. The accessorius nerve is also not injured. After releasing the neck preparation, inspect the wound area. After hemostasis with the bipolar coagulation forceps, there is no further bleeding. After removal of the neck specimen at the level of the junction of the omohyoid muscle and the internal jugular vein, there is no evidence of a chyle fistula. Exposure of the outlets of the external carotid artery (the superior thyroid artery and the facial artery can be safely exposed and dissected). Completion of the neck dissection on the left side without complications. Now release of the larynx by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Skeletonization of the hyoid bone. Removal of the hyoid bone. Release of the piriform sinus. Neck level VI was removed beforehand. Then entering the pharynx from the left side. It can be seen that the tumor grows very far into the base of the tongue. Tumor resection with a safety margin of 1 ˝ cm. Cut down towards the postcricoid region, first on the left side, then on the right side. Some of the pharynx must also be resected on the right side. Then place the larynx below the cricoid cartilage and send the specimen marked with a suture for frozen section. All frozen sections are designated as R0, but at one point with a safety margin of just under 0.2 cm. A resection of the pharyngeal mucosa on the left side is taken, which is then also designated as R0. Now insertion of a Provox Vega prosthesis size 10 in the usual manner. Mobilization of the base of the tongue and the pharynx in the cranial region. Pharyngeal suture in the usual manner in two layers. A T-shaped suture must be applied in the area of the base of the tongue, as otherwise there is too much tension due to the relatively large amount of mucosa missing here. However, due to the overall situation of the patient and the still sufficient mucosa for a primary closure, the decision is made against a free graft or a pedicled graft. Finally, a mucocutaneous anastomosis is created at the tracheostoma. Insertion of Redon drains. Two-layer wound closure and completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours. X-ray gruel swallow in this case only after the 14th postoperative day.","Laryngectomy, Partial pharyngectomy, Neck dissection

Insertion of a covered retractor. Snare the tongue, then inspect the tumor region. The tumor extends from the base of the tongue to the tonsil region to the anterior and posterior palatal arch and passes over to the soft palate and extends to the base of the uvula, but does not infiltrate it. First transoral tumor resection using a monopolar needle, scissors and bipolar forceps so that the tumor is detached from the soft palate and the tonsil region as well as from the tongue margin. Then switch to the transcervical approach. To do this, make a skin incision in a transverse skin fold 2 ˝ cm below the lower jaw. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle. Showing the submandibular gland. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath. First resection of the submandibular gland. The lower part of the tumor is then immediately encountered. A pharyngotomy is performed here, then the tumor is dislocated transcervically and successively cut around. It can be removed en bloc. The entire tumor is then thread-marked and sent for frozen section. In the frozen section, all edges are tumor-free. Basally in the area of the tongue, the margins are only very narrowly resected. Therefore, a resection is made here again, which is sent for final histology. Now complete the neck dissection. For this, free preparation of the internal jugular vein. Exposure of the N. accessorius, the V. facialis, which must be removed, the A. thyroidea superior and removal of the neck IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Measurement of the defect reveals a fairly large defect in the area of the edge of the tongue and the oropharynx. The flap is then configured so that one part can cover the posterior pharyngeal wall and one part goes to the tongue with a notch so that the tongue is not fixed later. This graft is drawn onto the forearm. Then cut around the skin. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the cephalic vein, exposure of the deep venous system in the crook of the elbow. The patient has no direct confluence in the crook of the elbow between the superficial and deep systems. The cephalic vein is therefore directly integrated with the graft. Exposure of the superficial ramus, radial nerve, this divides into 2 branches, unfortunately one branch cannot be preserved, but the larger main branch remains. Then visualization of the radial artery, clamping, ligation and repositioning of the radial artery. Detach the graft from the tendon bed, then dissect the pedicle in the usual way. Smaller vessels are clipped and bipolar coagulated. Then dissection of the vessel outlet in the elbow area. Exposure and identification of the ulnar and interosseous arteries. The radial artery is removed distally from its outlet. The cephalic vein and a larger accompanying vessel of the radial artery are dissected for the venous connection. The arm is then closed in the usual way using split skin. Neck dissection on the left side and tracheotomy by <CLINICIAN_NAME> are now performed in parallel with graft elevation. Now proceed to the tracheotomy: First mark the landmarks (jugulum, cricoid cartilage, thyroid incisura). Mark the skin incision. This is located at mid-height between the jugulum and the cricoid cartilage. Skin incision at a length of approx. 4 cm. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue. Two larger veins must be ligated and cut. Then dissect the linea alba of the infrahyoid musculature. Spread the muscles apart. Finding the thyroid isthmus. This is now dissected along the trachea. Then insertion of the Pean clamps and transection of the isthmus after bipolar coagulation. Ligation of the left and right isthmus. Free preparation of the trachea. Entering the trachea after preoxygenation between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage. Formation of a Björk flap and tracheocutaneous anastomosis in the typical manner. Retubing of the patient to a 9-gauge cannula. Proceed to neck dissection on the left side. The incision is first made at a length of approx. 7 to 8 cm, approx. 2 transverse fingers below the mandible in a skin fold. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue. Exposure and separation of the platysma and formation of a platysmal flap. This is exposed cranially and caudally. The anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is then dissected caudally to the omohyoid muscle, which is then dissected cranially/medially. Further dissection of the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Locate the submandibular gland. Dissection of the caudal glandular capsule and insertion into the anterior neck preparation. Locate the digaster venter muscle posteriorly and move along it anteriorly as far as the hyoid. Release the anterior neck preparation while protecting the hypoglossal nerve, which can be visualized and protected. Now dissect the cervical vascular sheath. The internal jugular vein and facial vein are exposed and spared. The common carotid artery and external carotid artery are exposed and spared, as are the vagus nerve and the cervical artery. The accessorius nerve is then explored. Dissection of level II b. Detachment of the fatty tissue with the lymph nodes along the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein to level IV caudally, level V is also removed. The fatty tissue is ligated and removed caudally in level IV. Detachment of the lateral neck preparation. Subsequent insertion of an 8 Redon drain. Subcutaneous suture with 3.0 Vicryl and skin suture with 4.0 Ethilon. Now insertion of the graft, first transcervically, then transorally. This is relatively difficult as the uvula, tongue and the entire oral mucosa are very swollen. In the end, the graft can be inserted completely. The vessels for the anastomosis are now exposed. For this purpose, the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein as well as an outlet from the internal jugular vein are taken. Finally, an artery and two veins are connected, which is successful without any problems and ensures good perfusion in the graft area. Insertion of a flap and two-layer wound closure. Re-intubation to a 9 mm tracheostomy tube. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please X-ray pre-swallow on the 10th postoperative day, until then nutrition via the previously inserted PEG tube. The PEG tube was inserted with good diaphanoscopy using the thread pull-through method.","Combined tumor resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), PEG placement, Tracheotomy

Due to the size and depth of growth, defect coverage using a flap was indicated.","First of all, position the patient again and perform the pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy: The exophytic tumor is seen, which extends from the tonsil lobe next to the uvula over the side wall into the base of the tongue or into the piriform sinus entrance. Due to the poor mouth opening and the narrow conditions, tracheostoma placement is now absolutely necessary before tumor resection for a better overview. PEG insertion: insertion of the esophagoscope. Pre-viewing into the stomach, insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube in a typical manner after establishing a sufficient diaphanoscopy. This is also fixed to the stomach wall in a typical manner without any problems. Now sterile draping of all areas, injection of a total of 20 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. First tracheostoma placement by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Small Kocher collar incision, dissection through the subcutaneous tissue to the infrahyoid musculature, which is split. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus, which is passed underneath, clamped, cut and supplied by means of a puncture ligature. Subsequent exposure of the trachea. Small visor flap or modified Björk flap. Epithelialization of this. Subsequent reintubation. Neck dissection on the left: Incision typically extended slightly caudally and cranially. Exposure of sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of digastric muscle, omohyoid muscle. Cranially there is a conglomerate of lymph nodes, which clinically corresponds to metastases. Visualization of the internal jugular vein, facial vein. Visualization of the internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, superior thyroid artery, facial artery and lingual artery. Exposure of vagus nerve, accessorius nerve, border cord and hypoglossal nerve. Clearing level II-V. Subsequent removal of the submandibular gland, including removal of some level Ib lymph nodes. Wharton's duct is ligated. The digastric muscle was also resected. Branches of the cervical plexus were exposed and preserved. Subsequent exposure of the internal and external carotid arteries and the internal jugular vein as well as the vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and glossopharyngeal nerve, initially up to the base of the skull. Nerves are dissected from the pharyngeal wall with vessel loops. The pharyngeal wall is lifted away from the prevertebral fascia. All soft tissues except for the hypoglossal nerve are mobilized towards the pharyngeal wall. The lateral hyoid bone and the upper parts of the superior concha are also mobilized. The lingual artery is ligated and turned laterally, as are the vein and facial artery. Then, starting transorally, the tumor is resected cranially with the entire wall. This is done caudally as far as the overview allows. Subsequently, further resection of the tumor from the transcervical side. Tumor is removed with a safety margin of at least 1.5 cm, in some cases up to 2 cm on all sides. Macroscopically clear in healthy tissue. The palatal arch falls to the left of the uvula both anteriorly and posteriorly, resection quite close to the tube. Pharyngeal wall in the area of the posterior wall up to the middle. Complete lateral wall up to the floor of the mouth in front. Resection extends into the piriform sinus, also includes parts of the vallecula up to the epiglottis and lateral parts of the base of the tongue. The specimen is marked with a suture and sent for frozen section. In the frozen section from the cranial to the alveolar ridge still severe dysplasia, also from the alveolar ridge to the base of the tongue. In situ infiltrates and partly microinvasive carcinoma caudally in the area of the entrance to the piriform sinus. Several extensive resections are therefore performed. A resection includes mucosa and some underlying tissue from the uvula to the alveolar ridge, thickness at least 1-1.5 cm. All sutures remote from the tumor. Further resection from the lateral area of the alveolar ridge to the base of the tongue via the floor of the mouth, also approx. 1 cm thick, sutures also tumor-free. A further marginal sample from the border area to the tube in the nasopharynx. Another from the caudal base of the tongue. Another caudal marginal sample is taken from the lingual epiglottis via the vallecula to the arytenoid fold and the piriform sinus, which extends medially to the resection border on the posterior pharyngeal wall. Here too, the sutures are remote from the tumor, thickness a good cm. In the frozen section, all marginal samples without dysplasia or carcinoma. Hemostasis now follows. Irrigation. Measurement of the defect size. This is 13.5 x 7.5 cm, flap is planned according to the size and required three-dimensional defect coverage. Neck dissection on the right: skin incision as on the opposite side but more limited. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, exposure of the omohyoid muscle, exposure of the digastric muscle. Subsequent evacuation level II-IV. Exposure of internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, superior thyroid artery, facial vein, internal jugular vein. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, accessorius nerve. Levels II-IV are evacuated, preserving branches of the cervical plexus. Subsequent careful hemostasis and layered wound closure with insertion of a Redon drainage. Then elevation of the radial flap, surgeons: <CLINICIAN_NAME>, <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Marking of the flap in the appropriate size and three-dimensional orientation. Then elevate the flap first from ulnar, subfascial, then extend the incision cranially to the olecranon. Exposure of the superficial venous system. Exposure of the connection to the deep venous system. The superficial venous system is then elevated subfascially. The flap is now elevated from the radial, subfascial side. The lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve is exposed and preserved as far as possible. The radial artery and radial vein are exposed caudally and initially clamped. Further elevation of the flap from lateral to medial. Lift the flap off the brachioradialis muscle. Further exposure of the superficial venous system. A venencephalica can be visualized medially and laterally. The radial artery is then cut and treated using 4-0 Prolene puncture ligatures. The flap is then removed subfascially. Outgoing vessels are clipped or treated using bipolar ligatures. Lifting of the flap cranially along the pedicle. Depiction of the interosseous artery, which is severed. Exposure of the entrance of the radial artery into the brachial artery. Depiction of confluence. Subsequent removal of the flap. The veins are ligated and the artery is supplied with Vascufil 6-0 puncture ligatures. The saturation in the hand area is always within the normal range until the end of flap elevation. After removal of the flap, it is flushed with heparin. The flap is then inserted into the defect. The flap is first sutured caudally, partly with the sutures in place. Subsequently, also partly with the sutures in place on the cranial side. Sufficient, tension-free defect coverage is achieved using the flap. The pedicle is inserted caudally into the soft tissues of the neck. The facial artery is selected and conditioned for the anastomosis. After conditioning the radial artery, suture using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial pulse and flow, good venous return. Then, starting from the facial nerve, one vein is conditioned for the anastomosis with the cephalic vein and a smaller one for the anastomosis with the confluence. The second cephalic vein is partly unsuitable for anastomosis due to thickened walls, probably due to scarring after infusion; it is clipped later. The smaller outlet of the facial vein is anastomosed with the confluence using a 2-0 coupler. Positive smear phenomenon after opening the clamps, good venous flow. Another outlet is clipped here. The larger outlet of the facial vein is anastomosed with the cephalic vein after conditioning using a 3-0 coupler. Here too, good venous return after opening the clamp. Positive smear phenomenon. Small outlets are also clipped here. Final inspection of the flap, which is regular. A tracheal cannula is inserted and fixed with sutures. The procedure is then completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue the intraoperative antibiotic treatment with Unacid 3 g for one week. Please continue heparin perfusor 500 E/h for 5 days. Control of the flap according to the scheme clinically and by means of Doppler sonography for 5 days. Site for Doppler was thread-marked. Flap control clinically well possible. Feeding via the inserted PEG tube for 10 days, followed by gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Overall, at least cT3 oropharyngeal carcinoma cN1-cN2b. Waiting for the final histology and presentation or discussion in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Tumor resection, Right-sided neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

This is only affected on the left side with a CIS. The tumor extension is made more difficult by the slightly overhanging supraglottis, so that a narrow strip of supraglottis is first removed by laser surgery. The tumor is then resected starting at the anterior commissure. The periosteum is exposed at the front and the altered vocal fold area is detached in a healthy layer. Extend the laser resection laterally as far as necessary so that healthy tissue can always be prepared or resected by laser surgery. The first part of the tumor covers the anterior third of the right vocal fold. In this way, the tumor is successively resected from its lateral attachment site so that it is mobile enough to also overlook the caudal part and then resected with an appropriate safety margin. Subsequently, marginal incisions are made supraglottically, subglottically and in the area of the anterior commissure. In the area of the anterior commissure, the tissue is unrepresentative or severely thermally altered. However, resection at this site shows no evidence of tumor. The tumor is then further developed dorsally. To do this, switch to the Kleinsasser B-tube. This time the resection extends to the vocal process, which is also partially removed. Here too, marginal sections are first taken from the resection margin, all of which prove to be free of tumor on frozen section histology. The remaining tumor parts on the arytenoid cartilage are then resected with an appropriate safety margin. The tube is repeatedly loaded onto the Kleinsasser B or C tube so that the tumor can also be resected medially in the area of the posterior commissure with an appropriate safety margin. In this way, tumor resection with partial removal of the right arytenoid cartilage is ultimately successful. The marginal incisions from this area also proved to be tumor-free on frozen section histology. In summary, an R0 resection can therefore be assumed. Finally, careful hemostasis by monopolar coagulation. Removal of the instruments without tooth damage and transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Transoral laser-surgical partial laryngeal resection for right cT2 glottic laryngeal carcinoma. All incisions were tumor-free on frozen section histology. Control panendoscopy in 8 weeks.","Transoral laser surgical tumor resection

It is a squamous cell carcinoma. The above-mentioned operation is now indicated.,"First pharyngoscopy to confirm extension: The exophytic tumor is seen, which extends from one tonsil lobe on the left to the other and also grows posteriorly towards the nasopharynx. Now transoral resection: The tumor is removed macroscopically on all sides with a safety margin of approx. 1.5 cm in healthy tissue. The entire tonsil lobe on the left, the entire palatal arch up to the hard palate or the beginning of the vomer and the entire tonsil lobe on the right as well as on the left side up to the base of the tongue are removed. The tumor is resected macroscopically on all sides in healthy tissue. Suture marking. This is followed in the middle of the palatal arch in the direction of the vomer by a marginal sample with mucosa and soft tissue. This is also thread-marked for frozen section diagnostics. The tumor on the left caudal side, below the tonsil pole in the direction of the base of the tongue is not yet healthy, otherwise healthy on all sides, and the marginal sample is also healthy. Therefore, another extensive resection is performed in the area of the posterior palatal arch in the caudal region, the anterior palatal arch and parts of the base of the tongue. Subsequently, a marginal sample is taken from the area mentioned, which is thread-marked and sent for frozen section. No more tumor infiltrates here. Thus overall R0 status. This is followed by repositioning for neck dissection and defect coverage using a radial flap. Sterile covering of all areas. Start with neck dissection on both sides (<CLINICIAN_NAME>): Start with neck dissection on the right side: mark a curved skin incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side, then dissect through the subcutaneous tissue, initially sparing the external jugular vein, exposing the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

Then locate the accessorius nerve, which is spared. Finally, the internal jugular vein and the facial vein are dissected in their course. Now develop the lateral neck preparation from level IIb to IV while sparing the cervical plexus and exposing the carotid artery and vagus nerve. All structures can be spared. Now follow the cervical artery and develop the anterior neck preparation while sparing all vascular structures. Finally, careful hemostasis and wound irrigation and then proceed to the creation of a plastic tracheostomy. Marking of a skin incision below the cricoid cartilage. Dissection through the subcutaneous tissue, ligation of two larger veins matching the anterior jugular vein, then separation of the infrahyoid musculature. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and undermining of the thyroid isthmus which is ligated on both sides. Now expose the anterior tracheal wall and incision in the 3rd cartilage interspace while sparing the cuff. Finally, creation of a classic Bjlörk flap and epithelialization of the tracheostoma with single-button sutures, which is completely tension-free. Now reintubation. Then proceed to neck dissection on the left side. In principle the same procedure as on the right side, exposing the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Trace the omohyoid muscle. Expose the glanular submandibular muscle which is retracted. Now expose the hypoglossal nerve and follow the digastric muscle. Dissection of the internal jugular vein and exposure of the accessory nerve, which is spared. Now also develop the lateral neck preparation from level IIb to IV. Then follow the cervical artery and develop the anterior neck preparation while sparing all neurovascular structures. Here too, hemostasis using bipolar coagulation and wound irrigation. We now move on to the microvascular anatomy on the right side of the neck. Elevation of the radialis flap from the left forearm: After measuring the defect enorally, the flap is 13 cm long and a maximum width of 6 cm. The flap is first incised from the ulnar side. A curved incision is then made in the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the superficial venous system. Subfascial elevation of the flap from the ulnar side. Exposure of the vascular pedicle. Exposure distal to the radial artery. This is clamped. Lift the flap subfascially from the radial side. The flap remains at 100% for 10-15 minutes after the radial artery has been clamped. The radial artery is then removed. Treatment with puncture ligatures 4.0 Prolene. Then lift the flap along the pedicle. Outgoing smaller vessels are coagulated bipolar or treated with clips. Lift the flap with the vascular pedicle and superficial venous system into the crook of the elbow. A double outlet of the cephalic vein, a connection to the deep venous system, can be visualized here. After clamping, the interosseous artery can also be removed. Flap perfusion is always 100%. No suitable confluence can be visualized in the area of the radial vein, several smaller vessels, some of which are less than 1 mm. The flap is then removed, the artery is clamped and sutured with 6.0 Vascufil above and below the inner surface. The veins are ligated. The flap is flushed with heparin. Then lift a piece of full-thickness skin of the appropriate size for the defect from the groin area on the right. After mobilizing the skin, the groin is closed in layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. The skin is successively worked into the defect. Cranial primary wound closure without tension. Dressing with hydrogel/Mepilex. Over this, cloud dressing and wrapping in absorbent cotton. A Cramer splint and loose wrapping in an elastic bandage is applied on top. Hand always well supplied with blood. Saturation at 100%. Good capillary pulse. Application to the hand. Now creation of a two transverse finger wide tunnel from the pharynx on the right into the soft tissues of the neck. Insertion of the flap into the defect. Insertion of the pedicle into the right side of the neck. Successive incorporation of the flap with 3.0 Vicryl single button sutures with low tension. The entire palatal arch area can be covered. In the area of the tonsillar lobe on the left, a portion of the defect in the caudal area of the pharyngeal wall remains uncovered by the flap while the pharyngeal wall is still very well preserved. Tension-free situs. Subsequent vascular anastomosis. Conditioning of the radial artery and the superior thyroid artery. Suture with 8.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. Conditioning of two venous outlets from the facial artery. These are each anastomized with 2.5 mm couplers after vessel conditioning. After opening the clamp, good venous return in each case. Smear phenomenon positive in each case. Extensive hemostasis again in both sides of the neck. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain on the left and a guided Redon drain on the right. Finally, insertion of a 9 mm tracheostomy tube, which is fixed with sutures. Completion of the procedure without complications. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue intraoperative antibiotics for 2-3 days with Unacid. Heparin perfusor, which was started intraoperatively at 500 I.U./hour, should be continued postoperatively for 5 days. Monitor the flap according to the scheme using clinical checks and Doppler checks. For this purpose, mark the suture on the right side of the neck in the area of the stalk. Feeding via inserted PEG tube. After approx. 10 days, gruel swallowing and, if necessary, food build-up. Overall cT2-3 palatal arch/oropharyngeal carcinoma on both sides. Defect covered by radial flap. Clinically no clear indication of lymph node metastases, but metastases on both sides possible with enlarged lymph nodes. After receiving the histology, please discuss in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Resection, Neck dissection, and Tracheotomy

Had resisted therapy in the further course. Now in 2012, the patient presented again in an emergency when intubation by the emergency physician was impossible due to asphyxia. A new panendoscopy was performed as part of the retracheotomy. This revealed an extensive laryngeal carcinoma, which was confirmed by biopsy to be a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The CT scan performed showed a cT4a laryngeal carcinoma on the right side with extensive destruction of the thyroid cartilage and extensive extralaryngeal growth, but no evidence of infiltration of vascular or mediastinal structures. There was also no evidence of distant metastasis, which is why the indication for surgical treatment was given, given the patient's desire for treatment.","First, after intubation via the existing tracheostoma, perform a pharyngo-/laryngoscopy: enter with the small bore tube under dental protection after inspecting the inconspicuous oral vestibule. An inconspicuous oral cavity including the floor of the mouth, tongue and soft palate is revealed. The oropharynx shows inconspicuous tonsil regions and posterior pharyngeal wall. The vallecula appears submucosally bulging, but there is still no exophytic tumor growth. The epiglottis is extremely displaced, there is an extensive, almost completely submucosal tumor that completely consumes the larynx. Careful inspection. The posterior wall of the hypopharynx and the lateral wall, including the piriform sinus, are completely free on the left, as is the free esophageal entrance; parts of the lateral wall of the hypopharynx are also free on the right. The piriform sinus is fixed and infiltrated by the tumor. Extensive extralaryngeal growth is palpated on the right side. Flexible esophagogastroscopy is now performed: an extensive scar is seen in the case of extensive gastrointestinal bleeding in 2010. With normal conditions in the gastric region and excellent diaphanoscopy, the stomach is now punctured without any problems and the PEG tube is inserted using the thread pull-through method without any problems. Inconspicuous esophagus on reflection. The patient is now repositioned. First of all, an apron flap is created by cutting around the old tracheostoma over a large area. Cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Creation of the apron flap taking into account the platysma salt layer. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on both sides. The extralaryngeal tumor growth can now be easily palpated. The thyroid gland is clearly enlarged but symmetrical and soft, and the infrahyoid muscles are not infiltrated. Initially start by detaching the tumorous process from the left side. To do this, first perform the neck dissection in the anterior region. Expose the submandibular gland. Exposure of the digastric muscle. Exposure and preservation of the facial vein. Dissection of the internal jugular vein. Exposure and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve. Exposure and preservation of the extremely strong superior thyroid artery. Exposure of the common carotid artery. The neck preparation is turned medially towards the tumor. This is followed by exposure of the thyroid cartilage horn. Release and ligation of the laryngeal bundle. Careful dissection and release of the piriform sinus. Exposure and release of the hyoid. This is clearly free on the left side. Dissection of the infrahyoid musculature. Dissection of the trachea on the left side. Left-sided resection of the thyroid isthmus. The pharynx is now entered between the thyroid cartilage and the hyoid, in the area of the left-sided vallecula, transition to the pharyngeal side wall. Free conditions here after inspection. Gradually widen the pharyngotomy and widen the mucosal incision. For a better overview, the lingual artery must be ligated and removed. It can now be seen that the epiglottis is also free on the left side. The vallecula is clearly tumor-free. Therefore, the mucosal incision is now extended along the aryepiglottic fold on the left and in the area of the vallecula. Successive release of the tumor. On the right side, the tumor appears to have at least contact with the hyoid, so the lateral right third is now resected. Now perform a parallel resection of the cervical sheath on the right side. The procedure is basically the same as on the opposite side. Expose the submandibular gland. Expose the digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein. The facial vein moves towards the tumor and is removed after ligation. Careful dissection and preservation of the hypoglossal nerve. The superior thyroid artery also runs into the tumor conglomerate and is also removed after ligation. Exposure of the common carotid artery. Exposure of the prevertebral fascia. Medial and caudal, also relatively right-sided resection of the thyroid isthmus. The thyroid isthmus is preserved on the specimen, but is not infiltrated macroscopically. The former tracheostoma is now completely excised. This is also inflammatory in depth, but without evidence of direct tumor infiltration. Now, after complete mobilization and exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, the tumour is resected. Circumscribed right paralaryngeal open tumor, but with clear and safe separation from the soft tissue of the neck. Otherwise, regular soft tissue remains on all sides of the tumor. Complete resection of the tumor with resection of the right-sided piriform sinus. The mucosa of the posterior wall can be completely preserved, also free esophageal entrance, no postcricoid growth. A small, exophytic, ulcerated area can be seen in the area of the right-sided piriform sinus, otherwise completely submucosal tumor. Removal of the trachea, taking the tracheostoma with it, and removal of the tumor macroscopically clearly in sano. The mucosal margin samples are now imaged circularly. Moderate grade dysplasia, but no higher grade dysplasia or CIS was diagnosed in the postcricoid region and the right-sided hypopharynx. Completely free conditions on the left side. Therefore, no further resections were performed here. After inspection, the subglottic area was clear and wide. A Provox prosthesis is now fitted. Due to the inflammatory changes in the tracheostoma, conditions were somewhat more difficult, also due to the deep-seated trachea. The Provox prosthesis is inserted as cranially as possible. This is technically successful without any problems. The neck dissection is then completed. In principle exactly the same procedure. First on the left side. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Release the accessorius triangle while carefully protecting the nerve. Release of level V with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Isolated ligation of a strong inflow to the thoracic duct. This can be easily visualized. Absolutely dry conditions here and no further measures. Complete exposure of the internal jugular vein beforehand. Careful wound inspection and turning to the opposite side. Level VI was removed en bloc with the preparation. Same procedure on the right side. Exposure of the accessorius nerve. Clearing of the accessorius triangle with careful protection of the nerve. Release of V a with careful protection of the cervical plexus branches. Ligation of the transverse cervical artery and coagulation of the right occipital artery. Careful wound inspection and hemostasis. Careful, two-layer pharyngeal suture with 3.0 mucosal suture, submucosal and inverting. Finally, good invasion of the 1st pharyngeal suture and tight conditions. Good mucosal conditions with preserved submucosal tissue. Mobilization of the detached thyroid gland is now performed, allowing a wide and large soft tissue mantle to be created on the pharyngeal tube. Suturing with 2.0 Vicryl. Final wound inspection. Insertion of a 10 Redon drain and cervical two-layer wound closure. Insertion of the tracheostoma. Clearly more difficult conditions here. Due to the inflammatory conditions in the area of the trachea and the relatively short tracheal stump, there is a slight tilting of the Provox prosthesis. Otherwise intact conditions on all sides. At the end of the operation, reintubation to a 10 mm tracheoflex cannula without any problems. Finally, also at the patient's request, removal of a left buccal atheroma, which has been present for many years. Also several atheroma-specific lesions distributed over the head. A curved skin incision is now made in the case of disturbing findings on the left buccal side. Cut through the skin. Excision of the directly subcutaneous mass, macroscopically and clinically clearly corresponding to an atheroma. Careful release strictly at the atheroma capsule. Therefore, protect the surrounding soft tissue. Meticulous hemostasis followed by careful, two-layer wound closure and completion of the procedure at this point without any indication of complications. Conclusion: Intraoperatively R0-resected cT4a cN2b glottic laryngeal carcinoma. Please perform a postoperative X-ray gruel swallow on the 9th postoperative day if the wound conditions are normal. In the area of the trachea, first wait for the wound to heal completely and then assess the Provox prosthesis.","Laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy and reconstruction, Neck dissection

The above-mentioned operation was therefore indicated. The patient was also informed in detail about defect coverage using a microvascular pedicled flap.,"First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The exophytic tumor is seen in the area of the hypopharyngeal side wall, passing over the anterior hypopharyngeal wall on the left to the postcricoid region and occupying it almost completely. The tumor also invades the left laryngeal skeleton via the arytenoid fold, thus confirming the indication for surgery. The patient is now repositioned: First neck dissection and tumor resection: creation of an apron flap in typical subplatysmal fashion. Then neck dissection on the right side: exposure of the digastric and omohyoid muscles. Dissection of the lymph node fat packet from the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath, internal jugular vein, common carotid artery. Internal carotid artery, external. Exposure of vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. Successive removal of the lymph nodes and fatty tissue from levels II-V, also by preserving branches of the cervical plexus. Neck dissection on the left side: This shows a conglomerate of cranial lymph nodes in level II, showing the omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle. The latter has grown together with the conglomerate and is also resected. Underlying the hypoglossal nerve. This runs through the middle of the lymph node conglomerate and must also be resected. Parts of the sternocleidomastoid muscle must also be resected in the cranial area. The internal jugular vein is also involved in the tumor process and must also be resected. It is exposed caudally and ligated twice. The lymph node conglomerate along the carotid artery and vagus nerve is then removed. Here, the mass must be dissected with some effort, particularly in the area of the bifurcation, but there is no tumor infiltration. Cranial exposure of the internal jugular vein and removal and double ligation of the vein also cranially in the vicinity of the jugular foramen. The accessorius nerve can be exposed and preserved here. Overall, level II-V evacuation as part of radical neck dissection. Subsequent tumor resection: First remove the level VI package, this is sent separately for histology. Then separation of the infrahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone. Subsequently detachment of the suprahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone. Exposure of the right superior cornu and separation of the piriform sinus. Separate the thyroid gland caudally and strike it caudo-laterally on both sides. On the left, the superior cornu is not released as it is located close to the tumor. Then enter the pharyngeal space above the level of the hyoid bone. Expose the tumor. The tumor is successively removed with a safety margin of at least 1.5 mm on all sides. This initially results in a partial pharyngectomy with laryngectomy. Laryngeal skeleton is released caudally with attached tumor and pharyngeal tube. Caudal creation of a tracheotomy and reintubation. Caudal suture of the trachea. The tumor preparation is then detached by cutting around a cranial tongue. The tumor specimen is marked with a suture. In addition, a caudal margin sample is taken and sent for frozen section. Unfortunately, carcinoma in situ infiltrate can still be seen in the left lateral, cranial and caudal tumor specimen. There is also carcinoma in situs in the area of the caudal margin sample. Therefore, margin samples are necessary at several locations. Extensive margin samples are taken approx. 1 cm wide caudally, laterally on the left and cranially. These are marked remote from the tumor and on the lateral suture. No more tumor infiltrates are visible here during the assessment. This ultimately results in a subtotal pharyngectomy. Due to the situation, defect coverage with a microvascular radial flap is now indicated. Provox prosthesis is not possible or sensible due to the overall situation and the proximity of the end of the defect to the potential Provox prosthesis site. However, a left myotomy has already been performed as part of the operation. The muscles of the cricopharyngeal muscle on the left side were completely severed over a length of 3-4 cm. Careful attention was paid to intact mucosa. This is followed by careful hemostasis and irrigation of the entire wound area. Now remove the left forearm flap: Marking of the defect size including skin monitor. Defect size 1.5 x 10 cm. Cut around the flap, initially ulnarly. Subsequently, dissection of the skin with some attached subcutaneous tissue and placement of a subcutaneous incision for skin monitoring. Extend the incision cranially to the crook of the elbow. Release of the skin monitor with subcutaneous tissue and superficial venous system. Release of the flap from radial, subfascial. Distal exposure of the radial artery. This is clamped for several times, here no changes in saturation, which is always 97-100 %. Subsequently, the radial artery is removed and treated cranially and caudally with 4-0 prolene sutures as a puncture. Successive elevation of the flap with deep pedicle, which was previously exposed under the brachioradialis muscle. Outgoing vessels are bipolarly coagulated and treated with clips. Exposure of a radial vein and cephalic vein through the antecubital fossa, which offers two outlets. Removal of the flap. The veins are ligated and the artery is treated with 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Spray the flap with heparin solution. Then successive insertion of the flap into the defect in the pharyngeal area. Incision of the skin at the esophageal entrance to improve the massage through the upper esophagus. Successive suturing of the flap with 3-0 or 4-0 Vicryl single-button sutures. This results in tension-free complete closure of the defect. The stalk is inserted cranially into the right side of the neck. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery. Anastomosis with the conditioned radial artery using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamps, good arterial flow, good venous return. V. radialis is anastomosed with an outlet from the A. facialis using a 2-0 coupler. Here too, good venous return after opening the clamp, positive smear phenomenon. A further vein which is branching off from the internal jugular vein is anastomosed with a branch from the cephalic vein, also using a 2.5 coupler. Again, after opening the clamp, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The remaining outlet from the cephalic vein is tilted close to the outlet. This is followed by irrigation of the entire wound area. Careful hemostasis. A Redon drain is inserted into each side of the neck on the right. The thyroid gland is adapted above the caudal part of the flap using 3-0 Vicryl sutures. Likewise the remaining infrahyoid muscles. Skin closure with suturing of the apron flap to the trachea and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. The skin monitor is sutured in place without tension via a small median incision. Good aspect. Tracheal cannula size 10 is placed and fixed with sutures. Closure of the forearm defect: approx. 0.7-0.8 mm thick split skin is removed from the thigh using the dermatome in a typical manner. The cranial parts of the wound on the forearm are sutured in layers. The defect is closed with the split skin, which is successively incorporated while protecting vascular and neuronal structures. Finally, a hydrogel-Mepilex dressing is applied and a loose compress bandage is placed over it and fixed with absorbent cotton. The arm is adjusted to a functional position on a Cramer splint and fixed with a flexible bandage. Loosening of the arm. Arm always well supplied with blood. Saturation between 95 and 100 %. The superficial wound area on the thigh is covered with a hydrocolloid dressing. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. The antibiotic treatment that was started intraoperatively should be continued with Unacid for 2-3 days. Heparin perfusor with 500 E/h, which was started intraoperatively, should be continued postoperatively for at least 5 days. Flap control for at least 5 days according to the scheme via Doppler control and control of the skin monitor. Leave the intraoperatively inserted gastric tube in place, feed via the previously inserted PEG tube for at least 10 days, then swallow porridge and, if necessary, build up the diet. Overall cT4a hypopharyngeal carcinoma with invasion of the left laryngeal skeleton. Under subtotal pharyngectomy, defect coverage by means of microvascularly pedicled radial flap from the left side necessary. Overall, given the size of the tumor, postoperative free chemotherapy is indicated.","Resection, Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial)

CT clearly shows thyroid cartilage infiltration by the tumor. Therefore, the above mentioned surgery is indicated.","<CLINICIAN_NAME>: Induction of anesthesia and intubation by the anesthesiologist, then first of all, insertion of the small bore tube and examination of the tumor. It can be seen that the tumor already starts at the lower tonsil pole on the right side and extends along the hypopharyngeal side wall and posterior wall into the piriform sinus, filling it completely and infiltrating the larynx laterally. Then sterile washing and draping and creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Start with the neck dissection on the right side. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the submandibular gland. Then locate the accessorius nerve and clear levels II b, III, IV and V while sparing the plexus branches. Exposure of the hypoglossal nerve and evacuation of the medial upper neck preparation. Then evacuation of the neck level VI and separate insertion of the neck level VI. Then turn to the opposite side and perform the neck dissection on the left side in the same way. Several large, coarse metastases are visible on the right side. On the left side only unspecifically enlarged lymph nodes. Then detachment of the cervical vascular sheath from the tumor and from the larynx. Detachment of the tumor from the spinal column. This is achieved without any problems using blunt dissection. Perform a median pharyngotomy at the level of the epiglottis. Then grasp the epiglottis and pull the epiglottis through the pharyngotomy. Carefully incise the mucosa along the aryepiglottic fold, first on the left side, then on the right side, observing the tumor margins. Release the laryngeal preparation in the posterior part. Then perform the tracheotomy. Enter the trachea between the 1st and 2nd tracheal cartilage. The patient has had a history of thyroidectomy, so that no thyroid gland was present. Suturing of the lower skin to the trachea. Then placement of a feeding tube under visualization. Locate the esophagus and remove the laryngeal specimen and the tumor specimen. An approx. 3 cm wide strip of mucosa remains in the upper part of the pharynx, but this becomes significantly smaller in the lower area, so that primary closure of the pharynx does not appear possible and the decision is therefore made to sew in a radialis graft in any case. In the meantime, suture marks are placed on the tumor specimen and the entire specimen is guided to the frozen section. Unfortunately, resection is necessary in 2 places, once in the area of the epiglottis and then at the caudal edge of the deposit. This is done by taking a resection specimen, which goes to the final histology and then new frozen sections. Both new frozen sections are tumor-free, so that an R0 situation can be confirmed intraoperatively. Therefore, lifting of the radialis graft and insertion of the graft as well as anastomosis of the vessels by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Parallel removal of the split skin from the right thigh and suturing of the split skin to the forearm. Application of a Mepilex dressing. Fixation of the Mepilex dressing with Mersilene sutures. Application of a Kramer splint. Completion of the operation without complications. <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Now removal of the forearm flap from the left forearm: After measuring the defect, the flap dimensions are 13 to 14 cm in length and at least 8 to 9 cm in width. Record the flap with a skin monitor on the left forearm. Then first cut around the flap ulnarly. Dissect the skin, leaving subcutaneous tissue in the area of the planned subcutaneous bridge to the skin monitor, which is cut around. Continue the incision into the crook of the elbow. The flap is lifted ulnarly subfascially while preserving the ulnar artery. Then, after locating the superficial venous system and including it in the flap pedicle, lift the flap subfascially from the radial side. Locate the vascular pedicle under the brachioradialis muscle and follow it to the elbow. Locate the radial artery caudally and clamp. First lift the flap from the radial subfascial. Subsequently, the radial artery is removed. This is treated distally and proximally with 4-0 Prolene sutures. Lift the flap subfascially along the flap pedicle, taking the subcutaneous tissue with it to the skin monitor. Individual vessels are bipolarly coagulated or clipped. In the antecubital region, visualization of the radial artery of the confluence with the brachial artery and the outlet of the interosseous artery. Subsequent exposure of the cephalic vein, which splits into 2 vein ends, with connection to the deep vein system. The radial artery splits into smaller veins in the area of the confluence, which is not suitable for anastomosis and is separated and supplied with a clip. Another caudal vein, which arises from the subcutaneous tissue of the skin monitor, can initially be retained. The flap is removed. Veins are ligated. The artery is treated with 6-0 Vascufil sutures. Flush the flap with heparin solution. Subsequent insertion of the flap: First myotomy laterally to facilitate passage of food later. Subsequent suturing of the flap successively with Vicryl 3-0 single button sutures to the remaining mucosal bridge in the case of a subtotal pharyngeal defect. Defect extends to the palatal arch in the area of the uvula. Flap suturing is successful at all points without tension. Partial duplication of the suture to secure it. Subsequent conditioning of the vessels. The radial artery is anastomosed with the lingual artery using 8-0 single Ethilon button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow and good venous return. An outlet of the cephalic vein is then conditioned and anastomosed with the facial vein using a 3.0 coupler. Here too, after opening the clamp, good venous flow. Positive smear phenomenon. The other end is anastomosed with the external jugular vein using a 2.5 mm coupler; here too, good flow conditions after opening the clamp. Positive smear phenomenon. Then careful hemostasis. Irrigation of the entire wound area. Repositioning of the apron flap. Suture the apron flap to the trachea without tension. The skin monitor is integrated into the skin on the right side with a right-sided vascular connection. Redon drains were inserted on both sides, guided on the right. Finally, insertion of a size 10 tracheal cannula, which is fixed with sutures. The site for Doppler control is marked on the right side in the area of the external jugular vein. The procedure is completed without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics for 2 to 3 days, which were started intraoperatively with clindamycin. Feeding via the PEG tube for at least 10 days, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up. Provox was not applied intraoperatively due to the flap situation and can still be applied at intervals. Please check the flap via skin monitor and Doppler sonography according to the scheme. Continue heparin perfusor 500 units per hour for 5 days. Overall cT4a cN2/4b oropharyngeal/hypopharyngeal/laryngeal carcinoma on the right. Postoperative radiochemotherapy should certainly be discussed.","Pharyngectomy, Neck dissection, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

Pre-insufflation into the stomach. After spontaneous diaphanoscopy, placement of a PEG tube with a thread pull-through method in the typical manner, no complications. The patient received 3 g Unacid i.v. perioperatively. Subsequently, infiltration of the subsequent apron flap incision with local anesthetic containing adrenaline. Sterile washing and draping. Marking and incision of the apron flap, which is lifted subplatysmal to the hyoid bone and fixed cranially in the usual manner. Then start with the right side. After identifying and opening the cervical vascular nerve sheath, regions II to V are successively removed. All non-lymphatic structures of the accessorius nerve, hypoglossal nerve and vagus nerve are spared and preserved. After evacuation of levels II to V and skeletonization of the carotid artery, the supralaryngeal vascular nerve bundle is severed. The insertions of the pharyngeal muscles are then separated from the lateral thyroid cartilage and the piriform sinus is released. Prior to this, the right thyroid lobe is ligated in the area of the isthmus and dislocated to the side. This also exposes the upper trachea. Then transition to the opposite side. In principle, a similar procedure is carried out here with the same findings. After separation of the pharyngeal muscles from the thyroid cartilage, the left piriform sinus is not released. The hyoid is then detached from the suprahyoid musculature with exposure of the pre-epiglottic fat body and preparation of the mucosa on the lingual epiglottis surface up to the upper edge of the epiglottis, without opening the pharynx first. The tracheostoma is then created. For this purpose, the 3rd tracheal clasp is cut caudally and the caudal mucocutaneous anastomosis is created. The patient is then reintubated without any problems. The 3rd tracheal clasp is then incised in an H-shape and the cartilage clasps are sutured to the side. Then transition to laryngectomy. For this, the larynx is first removed caudally under the cricoid. A caudally pedicled mucosal flap is then prepared, which will seal the tracheal chimney upwards towards Hermann. Removal of a marginal incision from the remaining endolaryngeal mucosal tissue from the specimen, which proves to be tumor-free on frozen section histology. Then dissection on the back of the cricoid cartilage down to the level of the arytenoid cartilage. Here then entry into the hypopharynx. After extending the incision on both sides, the tumor on the left side is visible. This shows that the first incision was made somewhat close to the tumor, so that an additional strip of mucosa is removed. The incision is then made on the right side along the epiglottis, leaving out the piriform sinus. On the tumor-bearing side, the tumor is cut around with an appropriate macroscopic safety distance of 1-11/2 cm and then joined in the area of the upper epiglottis edge or vallecula during the incision so that the larynx can be removed together with the pharyngeal part. Subsequently, circular marginal incisions are made from the pharyngeal defect. Dysplasia that does not correspond to CIS is still found in the area of the left hypopharynx. Nevertheless, resections are performed on this side and a new frozen section histological examination of the margin is performed, which then proves to be free of tumor and dysplasia. The defect measures approximately 9 cm in length and 6 cm in width. <CLINICIAN_NAME> then lifts the corresponding radial lobe in this size. Then remove the radial forearm flap on the left (<CLINICIAN_NAME>/PJ): Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Draw the flap boundaries 10 x 6 cm in the distal forearm proximal to the retina colum flexorum with an S-shaped course. Cut proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein. Dissection of the vein distally and with integration into the radial flap graft edge. Identification of the external ramus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion while leaving the tissue of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Then incision down to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle, taking care to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar nerve. Now identify the distal radialis and clamp it with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes under good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry on the thumb, the vessels are removed with subsequent ointment thread ligation after the pedicle has already been detached from the base, namely from the pronator quadratus and flexus policis longus muscles. Bipolar coagulation of the outgoing perforators and treatment with vascular clips into the cubital fossa. Exposure and sparing of the radial nerve in the median side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the ulnar and brachial arteries. The median cubital vein and the cephalic vein are also included, so that there are now 2 veins for anastomosis and the radial artery with an appropriate diameter is also removed proximally and treated with a lateral ligature. Hemostasis, two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm and distal graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. The split skin was previously lifted by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Application of a wound dressing and forearm splint. Subsequent suturing of the caudally pedicled mucosal flap on the tracheal chimney according to Hermann. Subsequently, myotomy of the constricotr pharyngis muscle and implantation of the Provox-Riga voice prosthesis. After removal of the radial lobe graft, it is sutured into the defect with single button sutures. The vascular pedicle is guided to the left side. The vessels or the branches of the external carotid artery up to the facial artery are extremely weak in caliber with a strong radial artery. For this reason, the maxillary artery is shown close to the external carotid artery and, after cutting through the digastric muscle, is followed as far as possible to the cranial side. Once there, it is displaced caudally together with the external carotid artery under the dissected hypoglossal nerve and anastomosed with the radial artery, which has approximately the same diameter. After the arterial anastomosis, the two venous anastomoses are made in an end-to-side manner to the internal jugular vein. A Redond suction drain is then placed on both sides and a drainage flap on the left side. Folding down of the apron flap and multi-layer wound closure with subsequent completion of the mucocutaneous anastomosis and reintubation of the patient onto a 10-gauge tracheostomy tube, which is fixed to the skin with 2 sutures. Sterile wound dressing. End of the operation, transfer of the patient to anesthesia. Conclusion: Total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy and defect coverage with a microvascular anastomosed radial lobe graft from the left forearm with simultaneous primary voice rehabilitation by implantation of a Provox-Riga voice prosthesis and myotomy of the constrictor pharyngis muscle due to a cT3 sinus piriformis carcinoma on the left side.","Total LE with partial pharyngectomy, Bilateral neck dissection, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial), Provox prosthesis, PEG placement

Now look at the palatal arch, which is completely affected by the tumor from one tonsil to the other; the uvula is only attached to a small connective tissue bridge infiltrated by the tumor and is resected. The tumor is then resected starting at the right caudal tonsil pole with the ultrasonic knife. This continues to the opposite side, in principle removing the entire soft palate. The resection ends again at the lower left tonsil pole. The preparation is then marked with sutures, particularly in the middle section. The main specimen is also examined using frozen section histology and proves to be a tumor resected in sano, also in the middle section. The subsequent marginal sections taken from the surrounding mucosal or defect margins also all proved to be tumor-free. After measuring the defect, a radial lobe graft of about 11 cm in length and up to 6 cm in width was required.

Several other veins and connectors are also very small and delicate and can all be preserved. Exposure of the pedicle between the muscle bellies. Exposure of the radial artery at the junction between the brachial and ulnar arteries. Now mark the ulnar borders. The flap is lifted 12 x 6 or 3 cm wide. Ulnar incision and elevation of the myofascial flap up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis. Further incision and lifting of the graft with involvement of the cephalic vein. Protect the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. The ulnar artery on the opposite side can also be spared without any problems. Locate the radial artery distally and mark it with a silk thread. To prevent shearing, the fascia is sutured to the skin with 4-0 Vicryl. Now continue to successively dissect the flap, incorporating the pedicle. Lifting the flap and separating the vessels. Stitching over exposed tendons, removal of split skin. Suturing of split skin and two-layer wound closure in the usual manner. Creation of pie crusts and application of a sterile plaster cast.

Free arytenoid fold. Transition medially to just on the posterior hypopharyngeal wall. Overall indication for flap coverage probably with preservation of the larynx. Now inject a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline into the sides of the neck. Subsequent sterile draping of all areas including radial flap and thigh flap. Start with tracheostoma creation: Kocher's collar incision, slightly widened, which can later be widened into an apron flap. Subsequent dissection through subcutaneous tissue up to the anterior jugular vein, which is cut and ligated on both sides. The infrahyoid muscles are then pushed apart. Exposure of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped, severed and then ligated using puncture ligatures. Then exposure of the trachea. Enter the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space. Incision into the trachea in the sense of a visor tracheotomy. Subsequent epithelialization in the caudal area. Re-intubation and insertion of a laryngectomy tube. Repositioning and sterile washing and draping. Creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Carry out the neck dissection on the right side. To do this, expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. Then expose the cervical vascular sheath. It is clear that the jugular vein is infiltrated by a long metastasis. This is deposited in the area of level IV and also deposited at the top. Then the sternocleidomastoid muscle is deposited, which is also infiltrated in the midfield. The accessorius nerve and the cervical plexus must also be removed, so that ultimately only the hypoglossal nerve and the common carotid artery as well as the division of the internal and external arteries remain. The metastasis extends far dorsally into level V b and is completely removed with the neck block. Transition to the other side. The sternocleidomastoid muscle, submandibular gland, omohyoid muscle and digastric muscle are also shown here. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and removal of the neck block II to V, sparing the plexus branches, sparing the accessorius nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. Now enter again with the Kleinsasser tube and inspect the tumor. An ulcer-like tumor can be seen, which begins below the tonsil lobe. Determine the entry limit into the pharynx. Then enter the pharynx from the left. Cut around the tumor with a safety margin of 1.5 cm. The specimen is placed on cork for frozen section. In the frozen section, all edges of the specimen are tumor-free and free of carcinoma in situ. Now measure the defect, 12 x 8 cm, and transition to the forearm. Draw a graft of the appropriate size and then palpate the radial artery and ulnar artery. Application of a 300 mmHg tourniquet and cutting of the graft and extension of the incision into the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the venous star in the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the cephalic vein, the basilic vein and the venous confluence. Dissection of the brachioradialis muscle. Dissection of the superficial ramus of the radial nerve. Exposure of the radial artery. Lifting of the graft from the tendon bed, protecting the ulnar artery and the tendons. Dissection of the pedicle up to the crook of the elbow. Then the stem is removed by <CLINICIAN_NAME> so that superficial and deep veins remain intact for connection. At the end, close the wound on the arm in the usual way. The tendon of the palmaris longus muscle must be removed in the distal area, as it stretches very far upwards and would probably pass through the split skin. Finally, a dorsal forearm splint was placed. In the meantime, <CLINICIAN_NAME> lifted the split skin from the right thigh in the usual way and then transplanted it to the left forearm. Subsequent suturing of the flap into the defect: The flap is sutured successively into the defect with 3-0 single Vicryl button sutures so that a tension-free closure is achieved and the pedicle can be passed to the opposite side for the vascular connections. Dissection of the facial vein and another small outlet directly between the facial and internal jugular veins. For the venous connections and dissection of the facial artery for the arterial anastomosis. Also removal of the submandibular gland for this purpose and for a better overview. Ductus wharton is ligated twice. Subsequent conditioning of the flap vessels and repeated heparin irrigation. The facial artery is sutured to the radial artery using 8-0 Ethilon single-button sutures. Opening of the clamp, good arterial flow, good venous return. The confluent vein is anastomosed to the small outlet between the internal jugular vein and facial vein using a 2-0 coupler. After opening the clamp, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The larger of the cephalic branches is then anastomosed to the facial vein using a 3-0 coupler. After opening the clamp, good venous return, positive smear phenomenon. The other outlet had already been clipped when the flap was removed. Subsequent careful hemostasis, irrigation. Closure of the wound with epithelialization of the tracheostoma in layers in a typical manner with insertion of a Redon drain on the left and insertion of 2 flaps on the right. Re-intubation. Insertion of a tracheal tube, which is fixed with sutures. The procedure is then completed without complications. Patient transferred to intensive care unit for monitoring. Please continue antibiotics administered intraoperatively for one week. Upper body elevation. Control of the flap clinically or by Doppler at the marked or suture-fixed site anteriorly on the neck for 5 days according to the control scheme. Feeding via the previously inserted PEG tube for at least 10-12 days, then gruel swallow and, if necessary, diet build-up. Overall cT2-3 hypoharyngeal carcinoma with cN2c status. Postoperative presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Transcervical resection, Bilateral neck dissection, Flap coverage, Free flap (Radial), Tracheotomy

Intubation is extremely difficult as the patient is very difficult to adjust. Then intubation with the small bore tube, this is only possible with the D-tube and inspection of the hypopharynx and larynx. No abnormalities in the hypopharynx. Then adjustment of the glottic plane, this is only possible in the posterior two thirds, the anterior commissure cannot be adjusted even after the greatest possible effort. An exophytic mass can be seen in the area of the left vocal fold, which does not infiltrate the arytenoid cartilage, but extends right up to it. Now images with the NBI device and the Cellvizio device by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Rearrangement and injection of Ultracaine. Sterile washing and draping. Zigzag skin incision in the usual manner. Exposure of the prelaryngeal musculature. Push aside the prelaryngeal musculature. Formation of a perichondrium flap. Then sawing open the larynx in the median line. Opening of the larynx and inspection of the tumor region. As previously described, the tumor appears on the left vocal fold, extends to the arytenoid cartilage up to the anterior commissure, but does not infiltrate the opposite side. The tumor extends into the subglottic slope, but does not infiltrate the subglottic region very far down, at most 0.5 cm below the glottic level. Now detach the tumor from the inside of the thyroid cartilage, this can be done without any problems. Temporarily remove the tube and detach the tumor with scissors. The tumor specimen is thread-marked for final histology. A resection is then taken in the area of the pocket fold. Now marginal samples. The marginal samples show invasive carcinoma in the subglottic and arytenoid cartilage and carcinoma in situ in the area of the perichondrium on the inner side of the thyroid cartilage. In this case, the inside of the thyroid cartilage is removed with a diamond burr and resections are made of both the subglottic and the arytenoid cartilage. The tip of the arya falls off. Now close the larynx in the usual way after drilling holes and suturing the ligamentum conicum. Then overlap the perichondrium flap of the thyroid gland and the prelaryngeal musculature. A flap was sutured in beforehand. Then two-layer skin closure and before suturing, a tracheotomy was created between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage and a mucocutaneous anastomosis was formed. Re-intubation to a tracheal cannula and insertion of a nasogastric tube. Completion of the procedure without complications.

Panendoscopy with sampling in domo <2016> was performed. Histologically, a poorly differentiated basaloid carcinoma was strongly P16 positive. In our preoperative tumor conference <2016>, it was decided to perform an enoral resection with neck dissection on the right side. The patient had sufficient time to ask questions preoperatively and was informed in detail about the procedure.","Transfer of the patient to the operating room and active implementation of the team time-out. Introductory consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Induction of intubation anesthesia by the colleagues. Positioning of the patient by the surgeon in the head reclination position. Inspection of the oropharynx begins with insertion of the McIvor mouth blocker. The tonsil on the right side is clearly prominent and hard to palpate. The tumor extends submucosally far into the soft palate on the right side. The medial tumor border is paramedian without crossing the midline. Caudally, the lower tonsil pole is tumor-free. There is no transition to the base of the tongue. Start tumor resection by marking the resection margins with the electric needle. Incision of the mucosa with the electric needle. Submucosal dissection with Cooper scissors. Smaller vessels are treated with the bipolar coagulation forceps. The tumor can be easily removed from the lateral oropharyngeal wall. The lower tonsil pole is free of tumor. Several marginal samples are taken for intraoperative frozen section diagnostics. It is shown that the cranial, medial and lateral margin samples of the tumor bed are still infiltrated by tumor. Decision to resect and resend the resected specimens for frozen section diagnostics. Here, too, tumor infiltration in the cranial and lateral areas of the tumor bed is noted. The findings are demonstrated to <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Decision to perform a generous resection in the cranial part of the tumor with subtotal resection of the soft palate. Re-determination of several representative marginal samples. These are now tumor-free. An R0 situation can therefore be definitively assumed. After completion of the tumor resection, re-inspection of the wound area. The anterior palatal arch was completely resected. The posterior palatal arch was also completely used up. In addition, the tumor resection had to be performed cranially up to a subtotal resection of the soft palate. In the cranial part of the posterior palatal arch there is a defect approx. 1 x 1 cm to the nasopharynx. The lateral resection margin extends to the parapharyngeal fatty tissue. Due to the depth of the defect, a neck dissection on the right side is not performed in the same session in order to avoid an extensive defect. Hemostasis is performed using hydrogen and bipolar coagulation forceps. An attempt is made to reduce the defect with several adapting sutures. Bleeding is checked again at the end of the operation by raising the blood pressure. The wound bed is completely dry. During the frozen section break, a PEG tube was also inserted in the usual manner using the suture pull-through method. This was performed without complications. Conclusion: The enoral tumor resection of a cT2 cN2b oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right side was performed today. Due to the size and depth of the defect in relation to the lateral pharyngeal wall with exposed parapharyngeal fatty tissue, simultaneous neck dissection is not performed. This should be planned at least 3 weeks apart. Depending on how well the wound has healed by granulation by then, defect coverage using vascular-free microvascular flap plasty should be discussed at the same time. This should be performed to prevent regurgitation, particularly with regard to the functional results in the case of a pronounced defect in the soft palate. Please wait for the final histology and present the case again in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Transoral tumor tonsillectomy

The deeply ulcerated tumor on the left edge of the tongue is seen, which extends into the base of the tongue and runs towards the floor of the mouth and the lingual box. First transoral tumor resection: insertion of a retractor, placement of a tongue tie suture. Tumor is removed on all sides with a safety margin of 1.5 to 2 cm. The posterior 2/3 of the tongue including the base of the tongue, floor of the mouth including the lingual nerve and parts of the submandibular and sublingual glands as well as the tonsil and glossotonsillar junction are removed. The specimen is marked with a thread and sent for frozen section. No infiltrates in all margins in the frozen section, thus R0 situation. The lingual artery was ligated during the transoral resection. Careful hemostasis. Repositioning for neck dissection and tracheostomy. First radical neck dissection on the right: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid and omohyoid muscles as well as the digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, external carotid artery. Large vessels can be dissected cranially from the lymph node conglomerate. Vagus nerve is exposed and preserved. Also the hypoglossal nerve. N. accessorius cannot be preserved and is resected together with the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Similarly, hardly any muscular structures can be preserved in the cranial part. The metastasis is infiltrated in muscular structures and in the cervical plexus. All branches infiltrated by the lymph node conglomerate are also resected, including the accessorius nerve. All deep cervical muscles and neck muscles are also resected, including the trapezius muscle. Caudally positive lymph nodes up to level V. Branches of the cervical plexus can be preserved in the caudal part. Evacuation level II to V. Due to the extensive lymph node metastasis, large areas of subcutaneous tissue below the nuchal and occipital skin as well as muscular tissue are removed. This is sent for frozen section. No more tumor infiltrates here. The submandibular gland is removed to create an enoral tunnel. The digastric and styloid muscles are severed. Remains of the lingual nerve are removed together with the gland. The lingual nerve had already fallen during the transoral tumor resection. The hypoglossal nerve can be preserved. Subsequent neck dissection on the left side: exposure of the sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid and digastric muscles. Exposure and preservation of the internal jugular vein, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery. Visualization of the superior thyroid artery and hypoglossal nerve, accessorius nerve and vagus nerve. Also visualization of the border cord. Evacuation level II to IV, followed by tracheostoma placement. Kocher's collar incision. Exposure of linea alba. Dissection of the infrahyoid musculature, visualization of the thyroid isthmus. This is passed underneath, clamped off, severed and supplied by means of puncture ligatures. Subsequent exposure of the trachea. In the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space, enter the trachea and create a wide pedicled modified Björk flap. This is epithelized in the typical manner. Re-intubation and creation of a Woodbridge tube. Subsequent removal of the forearm graft from the left: After measuring the size, which is 10-11 x 6-7 cm, the flap is marked in the corresponding orientation for the course of the pedicle. The flap is then lifted from the ulnar subfascial side, followed by an incision in the crook of the elbow. Expose the superficial venous system and connect to the deep venous system. Then expose the flap radially and lift subfascially. The lateral cutaneous ramus of the antibrachial cutaneous nerve is exposed and preserved. Distal exposure of the radial artery and accompanying veins. Initially clamp for a few minutes. Exposure of the pedicle along the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure and connection of the deep superficial venous system. A cephalic vein with 2 outlets can be visualized in the crook of the elbow. The radial artery and a relatively well preserved confluence can also be visualized. Then dissection of the radial artery distally. Saturation always at 100 %. Successive elevation of the flap subfascially. Smaller vessels are supplied bipolar or with clips. Lift up to the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the radial artery and venous outlets. Deposition of the flap on 2 outlets from the cephalic vein, which are ligated, as well as deposition on an outlet corresponding to the confluence and ligation here. The radial artery is removed, which is treated with a 6-0 Vascufil suture. The interosseous artery is also severed. Treatment with clips. After previous clamping, the hand was also always well perfused with saturation of 99-100%. The flap is then removed and flushed with heparin solution. A piece of split skin 0.8 mm thick is removed from the thigh. This is then treated with a hydrogel dressing. Split skin is worked into the defect. Complete defect coverage. Closure primarily cranially. Insertion of a Redon drain underneath. Subsequent hydrogel-Mepilex dressing. Cover with a cotton swab dressing. Wrapping in absorbent cotton. Fitting of a Cramer splint. This is fixed in a functional position with a tape bandage. Hand still with normal saturation when attached. Now suture the flap: After sutures have been placed, the flap is successively worked into the defect. The pedicle is passed caudally in between. The flap can be worked into the defect without tension. Complete functional closure of the defect. Subsequent anastomosis of the flap. Conditioning of the superior thyroid artery and the radial artery. Anastomosis with 9.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow and good venous return. The facial vein is then exposed with 2 outlets and conditioned. After conditioning, the larger outlet is anastomosed with the confluence with 3-0 coupler. After opening the clamps, good venous flow smear, positive phenomenon. Subsequently, before the outlets of the cephalic vein, the larger one is anastomosed with the second outlet from the facial vein, also with a 3-0 coupler. Again, good venous flow after opening the clamp. Positive smear phenomenon. The other outlet is closed or ligated. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Irrigation of the entire wound area. Wound closure on the left with insertion of 2 flaps. Wound closure on the right after careful hemostasis and irrigation with insertion of a Redon drain. Insertion of an 8-0 tracheostomy tube. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient admitted to intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue the intraoperative antibiotic treatment with Unacid for one week. Nutrition via the inserted PEG tube for 7-10 days. Then, if necessary, swallow gruel and build up diet. Please continue intraoperative therapy with heparin perfusor 500 E/hour for 5 days. Flap control clinically according to the scheme for 5 days. Overall cT2-3 squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue margin/base of tongue and glossotonsillar junction. Extensive lymph node infiltration in the soft tissue nuchal occipital right. Therefore radical neck dissection. Postoperative RCT certainly indicated. Presentation in the interdisciplinary tumor conference.","Resection, Neck dissection, Defect coverage, Tracheotomy

Transnasal intubation by anesthesia colleagues. Sterile washing and draping. Start with transoral tumor resection. For this purpose, the tongue is snared and the tumor region is cut around with the monopolar needle in the area of the edge of the tongue to the base of the tongue. Then switch to the neck, as an overview is no longer guaranteed and the main tumor mass is located in the base of the tongue; instead, a skin incision is made in a transverse skin fold 3 transverse fingers below the lower jaw. Exposure of the platysma. Separation of the platysma. Dissection of the platysma cranially and caudally. Exposure of the submandibular gland, then the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the cervical vascular sheath and the accessorius nerve. Levels II to V a are then dissected out, sparing the plexus branches. The submandibular gland is detached and the digastric muscle is cut. The tumor clearly bulges in the area of the floor of the mouth and level II and can also be palpated here. Except for the external jugular vein, all neck vessels can be preserved. Now tanscervical tumor resection. To do this, grasp the tumor and subcircumcise it. Perform a pharyngotomy and enter the oral cavity. Further tumor resection using the pull-through technique. This allows the tumor to be completely resected en bloc. In the area of the glossotonsillar groove and in the area of the edge of the tongue, the tumor is very narrowly resected macroscopically, so a generous resection is performed here and a marginal sample is taken. Unfortunately, the resected frozen section still showed invasive carcinoma in the area of the edge of the tongue. Due to an organizational oversight, the marginal sample from the edge of the tongue that was taken after the resection was unfortunately not included in the frozen section. Therefore, another resection is performed here and a marginal sample is taken, which is ultimately tumor-free, final R0 situation. Repositioning for neck dissection on the right side and tracheotomy. Tracheotomy dictation <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Marking of the landmarks (thyroid incisura, cricoid cartilage and jugulum). Mark the skin incision approximately 0.5 cm below the cricoid cartilage. Now start the incision and cut through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. This is carefully bipolarized. Insert two sharp retractors and dissect through the entire subcutaneous fatty tissue. Dissection on the prelaryngeal musculature. The linea alba is sought out and dissection continues in this area. The prelaryngeal musculature is released in the middle and pushed bluntly to both sides. Locate the capsule of the thyroid gland. Here ligation of a vein. The thyroid gland is ligated and the remaining ends are bipolarized. There is hemostasis. Exposure of the trachea. The trachea is now opened between the second and third tracheal clips. The incision is extended further to the right and left. A Björk flap is not applied. Suture in the Mersilene sutures. With the Kilian speculum, reintubation is performed without any problems, so that an 8 mm tube is now used for ventilation during the operation. Neck dissection on the right. Skin incision three transverse fingers below the lower jaw in a skin fold. Exposure of the platysma and dissection and preparation of the platysma cranially and caudally. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the submandibular gland, the omohyoid muscle and the digastric muscle. Clearing out the neck levels II a to V a, while sparing the plexus branches. All vessels, including the external jugular vein, can be preserved. Lifting the radial artery graft. First palpate the radial artery and mark the graft 12 x 8 cm. Then unwrap the forearm and further dissection in bloodlessness. Cut around the graft in the skin area. Incision up to the crook of the elbow. Exposure of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the venous star in the antecubital fossa. Exposure of the superficial ramus, radial nerve, which divides into two main branches. Both main branches can be preserved. Exposure of the radial artery. Clamping and severing of the radial artery. Ligation. Detachment of the graft from the tendons and release of the pedicle in the usual manner. Deposition of the radialis graft with a superficial and a deep vein. Suturing of the graft first from the transoral side, starting at the soft palate, then along the floor of the mouth. The graft must be attached to the teeth and the alveolar ridge, as there is not enough mucosal remnant in the rest of the floor of the mouth. Further suturing from transcervically in the area of the pharynx and the vallecula and finally reconstruction of the tongue with the remainder of the transoral graft. Repositioning to perform the vascular anastomosis. The radial artery is connected to the facial artery and a vein from the graft to the facial vein and another vein to a branch of the facial vein. Good graft perfusion at the end. Insertion of 2 Redon drains, one on the left, one on the right and two-layer wound closure on both sides. The patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotic treatment for 24 hours postoperatively, then X-ray emesis on the 10th postoperative day and diet build-up if no fistula is present.

This revealed at least a cT2 cN0 glottic carcinoma on the left side with submucosal extension of at least 1 cm to the subglottic and 1 ˝ cm to the supraglottic. ENT mirror examination shows aryfixation and vocal fold paresis on the left side. The tumor grows submucosally. B-scan sonography shows a cN0 neck status. An external CT neck/thorax revealed clinical findings without definite evidence of thyroid cartilage infiltration. Based on the medical history and clinical findings, the above-mentioned procedure was indicated. The patient had sufficient time and opportunity to ask questions about the operation and the procedure.","The patient is first taken to the operating theater, followed by active patient identification. Consultation with anesthesia colleagues. Carrying out the team time-out. Induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. Subsequent tracheobronchoscopy with 0° optics by the surgeon and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. This reveals the carcinoma described above, which describes the entire vocal fold with infiltration and encasement of the arytenoid cartilage on the left side and also grows into the anterior commissure. The vocal folds cannot be passed. Here is an attempt at anesthesia for transnasal intubation. This is initially unsuccessful due to the extension of the tumor into the subglottic and glottic areas. There is a drop in saturation. Only after considerable effort can the tube be inserted orotracheally by the anesthesia colleagues. The anesthesia is now deepened and a perioperative ultrasound is performed. As can also be seen on the CT scan, the tumor masses surround the arytenoid cartilage. For this reason and due to the panendoscopy findings described above with a minimum submucosal extension of 1 cm subglottically, <CLINICIAN_NAME> decided to perform a laryngectomy. CT and ultrasound also show a wide subglottic extension of the tumor towards the cricoid cartilage. Infiltration of the cricoid cartilage is also highly probable here. Now head positioning by the surgeon. Skin disinfection and infiltration anesthesia in the area of the planned skin incision with a total of 10 ml Ultracaine. Skin disinfection and sterile draping of the surgical area. Marking of the landmarks on both sides of the mandibular angle, mandibular branch, chin, incisura thyroidea, cricoid cartilage, jugulum, sternocleidomastoid and the mastoid as well as the skin incision in the sense of an apron flap. Now creation of an apron flap in a typical manner. Start of neck dissection on the left side through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Expose the sternocleidomastoid, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle and follow them. Exposure of the accessorius nerve, the hypoglossal nerve and release of the neck level II a to V a while sparing the plexus branches and the superior thyroid artery. There are 2 spherical, suspicious masses in the area mainly in level II and in level V below the plexus branches. The vagus nerve is visualized and spared. Also the cervical vascular sheath with the common carotid artery and the internal jugular vein in level IV. Extensive bipolar coagulation. No evidence of chyle fistula. Now exposing the hyoid bone. Release of the hyoid bone on the left side. Detachment of the cervical vascular sheath from the larynx and pharyngeal region. Detachment of the thyroid gland. Undermining of the thyroid isthmus using Pean clamps and ligation of the thyroid isthmus after severing it. Exposure of the superior laryngeal nerve, artery and vein. Dissection of the same and coagulation of the same. Now move to the opposite side to the right and perform right neck dissection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Identical procedure. Expose the sternocleidomastoid, the omohyoid, the submandibular gland and the digaster venter muscle posteriorly and anteriorly. Exposure of the nervus accessorius, hypoglossus, ansa and vagus and sparing of the same. Now clearing from level II to level V a, also sparing the plexus branches and the vagus nerve. Exposure of the common carotid artery. Release of the hyoid bone. Removal of the hyoid bone. Skeletonization of the thyroid cartilage on both sides. Exposure of the superior laryngeal nerve, artery and vein. Separation and bipolar coagulation of the same. Detachment of the cervical vascular sheath from the larynx and laryngeal region. Detachment of the thyroid gland and mobilization from the trachea. Detachment of the infrahyoid musculature and the laryngeal musculature. Perform a tracheotomy between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal cartilage and transfer intubation to a laryngectomy tube. Further skeletonization of the larynx on the right side. Release and removal of the piriform sinus. Same procedure on the left side. Enter the pharynx at the level of the epiglottis from the right side. Pull out the epiglottis through a pharyngotomy and incise the mucosa along the edge of the epiglottis up to the arytenoid region. Here, release the mucosa caudally from the arytenoid cartilage. Detachment and separation of the larynx. It can now be seen that the tumor completely surrounds the arytenoid cartilage and extends far into the subglottic region, infiltrating the cricoid cartilage. Overall growth of at least 1 ˝ cm from the glottic level to the subglottic level. Suture mark tracheal posterior wall caudal, lateral wall left, aryepiglottic fold on both sides and arytenoid cartilage dorsal left. Here the frozen section shows free on all sides, in the ary area dorsal left just in sano, here a cone draws close to the resection margin. Now create an oesophagotracheal fistula and insert a size 8 Provox prosthesis. Now perform the pharyngeal suture in three layers as usual, alternating between <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Now inspect the wound again. Irrigation with H2O2 and Ringer. Bipolar coagulation. Dry wound conditions. Insertion of a 10 Redon on both sides. Incision of the skin in the area of the stoma and two-layer wound closure. The operation is now completed without complications. The patient goes to the intensive care unit awake. Please continue antibiotics 3x 3 g Unacid. Please feed only via nasogastric tube for 10 days, then X-ray gruel.","Laryngectomy, Selective neck dissection, and Tracheotomy

Postoperatively, 90 ml of blood in the redon within 2 hours and a swollen neck on the left side. The wound was therefore opened in the recovery room and a large hematoma was relieved and there was significant post-operative bleeding, so the patient was taken to the operating room on an emergency basis.","Intubation by anesthesia colleagues and sterile draping. Subsequent reopening of the cutaneous and subcutaneous suture. Aspiration of the hematoma. Overall, there is diffuse bleeding in several places and a minimal vascular stump cranial to the paralaryngeal omohyoid muscle. This is ligated, but then breaks off; it can no longer be found during the dissection, but this site is extensively coagulated and no further bleeding occurs centrally. Other sites are also extensively bipolar coagulated. Overall, no large or medium-sized vessel can be identified that could have caused the bleeding. Repeated irrigation with Ringer's and finally also with H2O2, again no relevant bleeding, not even after raising the systolic blood pressure above 120 mmHg. Therefore, another Redon insertion, subcutaneous and skin sutures with 4.0 Vicryl and 4.0 Ethilon. Enorally dry conditions, therefore termination of the operation. Note: At the beginning of the operation, the patient again received 7 ampoules of Minirin and 1 platelet concentrate intraoperatively. He also received 1000 mg tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid 1000 mg please 3 times daily, BGA check in intensive care unit. Minirin 7 ampoules every 12 hours.

This revealed the above-mentioned laryngeal carcinoma, CT morphology showed a clear thyroid cartilage infiltration on the right side, hence the indication for the above-mentioned procedure.","Induction of anesthesia and intubation by anesthesia colleagues. Injection, sterile washing and draping. Prior to this, a PEG was inserted using the thread pull-through method and diaphanoscopy was performed without any problems. Start with the skin incision in the usual manner and exposure of the platysma and creation of an apron flap by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Start with neck dissection on the right side by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The sternocleidomastoid, digastric and omohyoid muscles, the submandibular gland and the cervical vascular sheath are shown here. Level II and III show large metastases, which are laboriously dissected from the internal jugular vein. There is no infiltration of the internal jugular vein. Change of surgeons and continuation of the operation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Exposure of the accessorius nerve and release of the neck preparation IIa to Va while sparing the plexus branches. Release of level VI. Turning to the opposite side. Here also visualization of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the submandibular gland and the digastric muscle. There are also several metastases here, also adherent to the internal jugular vein, but not infiltrating. These must also be carefully separated from the internal jugular vein. Release level VI and start free preparation of the larynx. First detach the cervical vascular sheath from the pharynx and larynx area. Detachment of the thyroid gland on the right side, then also on the left side. Release and removal of the hyoid bone with detachment of the infrahyal musculature. Skeletonization of the larynx, initially on the right side. Beginning with the release of the piriform sinus. This is only very partially possible here due to the tumor infiltration. Turning to the other side. Here the piriform sinus can be completely released from the thyroid cartilage. Entering the left paramedian pharynx. Disluxation of the epiglottis. A spatula must be inserted into the mouth for this. Incision of the mucosa along the edge of the epiglottis on the right side and inspection of the pharynx and the tumor region. It can be clearly seen that the tumor has infiltrated the aryepiglottic fold, the ary and the medial part of the piriform sinus on the right side. Therefore, a little more mucosa must be resected on the left side. Care is taken to ensure that a safety margin of 1 cm is maintained. Detachment of the mucosa from the postcricoid region and removal of the larynx below the cricoid cartilage by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Take marginal samples from all mucosal margins and send for frozen section. In the meantime, a Provox-VEGA is inserted by <CLINICIAN_NAME> in the usual manner. Then the attachments of the sternocleidomastoid muscle are reduced and a myotomy is performed on the esophageal sphincter on the left side. The esophagus is well and easily passable. Start with the pharyngeal suture from caudal to cranial and also from cranial to caudal under the incision of a ""T"". The frozen section findings are made in the meantime. Carcinoma infiltrates can still be found at the esophageal entrance on the right side, as well as at the base of the tongue on the right side. However, there is normal mucosa between the esophageal opening and the base of the tongue. The pharyngeal suture is reopened and resected both at the esophageal opening and at the base of the tongue. A lot of resection is carried out at the base of the tongue and marginal samples are taken again at the affected areas, which no longer show any invasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ. The pharyngeal suture is therefore repeated in three layers in the usual manner. At the end, insertion of Redon drains and two-layer wound closure. Insertion of a 10-gauge tracheostomy tube and transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics for three postoperative days. X-ray pre-swallow on the 10th postoperative day.","Laryngectomy, Right tongue partial resection, Bilateral neck dissection, and PEG placement, Tracheotomy

Start of tumor resection in the area of the soft palate with the electric needle. Dissection up to the tonsil bed. The soft tissues of the throat are reached relatively quickly here. Dissection up to the base of the tongue and dissection at the edge of the tongue. Ultimately, the tumor cannot be completely removed transorally, so it is transferred for neck dissection. Creation of an apron flap in the usual manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the omohyoid muscle, the digaster and the submandibular gland. Exposure of the cervical vascular sheath and the accessorius and hypoglossal nerves. Then evacuation of the neck levels I b to V a while sparing the plexus branches. Removal of the submandibular gland. Cut through the digastric muscle and enter the oropharynx. Now pull through the tumor and complete the tumor resection from transcervical.

No increased bleeding, no chyle. Tracheotomy: Marking of the landmarks and dissection through the prelaryngeal muscles in the linea alba onto the cricoid cartilage. Push the prelaryngeal musculature to the side. Exposure of the thyroid gland and undermining of the thyroid gland with the Pean clamp. Bipolar coagulation of the thyroid gland and careful transection of the thyroid gland. Move the thyroid gland to the side and expose the trachea. Opening of the trachea between the 2nd and 3rd interspace. Entering the trachea and creating a Björ flap. Suturing of the tracheostoma at the caudal edge. Now hand over the operation to the reconstruction team with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. First measure the required dimensions of the flap, these are max. 12 cm long and 10 cm wide. The flap is then raised on the radialis flap on the left forearm: Mark the flap dimensions according to the required size and three-dimensional configuration. Then recut the flap, initially ulnarly. The incision is extended in the direction of the ulnar flexion. Exposure of the superficial venous system, which is integrated into the flap. Lift the flap initially from the ulnar side. Subsequent incision also from the radial side with subfascial and ulnar elevation of the flap. The lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve is exposed and preserved as far as possible. Distal exposure of the radial artery, which is clamped off. .................................. Lateral exposure of the superficial venous system up to the crook of the elbow. This shows the cephalic vein with two good ends, a good connection to the deep venous system. Depiction of the deep venous system. Exposure of the vascular pedicle. Subsequent transection of the radial artery with good saturation. This is treated proximally and distally with 4.0 Prolene single-button stitches. Lift the flap subfascially. Outgoing vessels are coagulated or clipped. Dissection up to the crook of the elbow. After clamping, cut the interosseous artery. Exposure of the venous confluence, which is lifted with a total of 2 ends. The veins, which are ligated, are then removed and the artery, which is supplied with a 6.0 Prolene suture in the area of the end of the brachial artery, is removed. Flush the flap with heparin solution. Subsequent insertion of the flap into the defect. Successive suturing of the flap, first from the transcervical and then from the transoral side, partly with the sutures in place using 3.0 Vicryl single-button sutures. The result is a tension-free, complete and anatomically correct reconstruction. Flap pedicle is prepared. The radial artery and 2 ends of the cephalic vein are conditioned, as are the superior thyroid artery, the middle thyroid vein and the external jugular vein. The arteries are sutured using 9.0 Ethilon single-button sutures. The veins are anastomosed using 3 and 2 couplers. Positive smear phenomenon after opening the clamps. Arterial flow after opening the clamp before the vein anastomosis is also regular. Subsequent careful irrigation of the wound area and hemostasis. Wound closure of the neck sides is carried out by suturing the skin on the tracheostoma area and inserting Redon drainage on the left and 2 flaps on the right. The cannula is fixed with sutures. Flap vital after repeated transoral inspection. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue the antibiotic treatment with Unacid for 1 week. Nutrition via the inserted PEG tube until the 7th-10th day, then gruel and, if necessary, diet build-up.

In addition, the rhinoscopy revealed a large polyp in the area of the left middle nasal passage. A CT scan showed a shadow in the area of the ethmoid bone on the left and also on the right. As the patient was symptom-free with regard to the nose, the decision was made to perform a circumscribed, findings-adapted sinus operation on the left with polypectomy and laser chordectomy on the right in the case of histologically confirmed carcinoma.","After induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues, the surgeon first positions the patient. Shortening of the vibrissae, disinfection of the vestibule. Sterile wiping and draping. Entering the left nasal cavity with 45° optics. The large polyp is already visible. This is grasped at the base and successively removed. The anterior ethmoid bone is opened and the ethmoid bone is cleared out in a circumscribed manner. The base of the skull is not exposed. Subsequently, careful infundibulotomy on the left and exposure of the maxillary sinus ostium. This is carefully widened with the wing punches and smoothed in the area of the ethmoidal sinus transition with the cutting Blakesley. The maxillary sinus itself is free and without irritation. Therefore, no further measures should be taken in this area for the time being. Reposition the patient. Enter with the small irrigation tube and adjust the endolarynx. The exophytic mass described above can already be seen in the area of the right vocal fold, which extends to the anterior commissure but does not appear to infiltrate it. Laterally, it appears to extend partially into the ventriculus laryngis. Dorsally, the mass extends as far as the vocal process. Therefore, first carefully cut around the tumor with macroscopically sufficient safety distance using the laser with 4 watts in CW mode. This works very well. Successive dissection and removal of the tumor. The vocalis muscle is largely resected as well as parts of the pocket fold. As the tumor reaches the vocal process, this is also resected with the laser. Ultimately, the tumor is successfully resected in toto with a macroscopically sufficient safety margin. In between, hemostasis is repeatedly performed with a defocused laser and supratupers. Finally, marginal samples are taken in the area of the posterior pocket fold, anterior pocket fold, anterior commissure, subglottic anterior, subglottic posterior and in the area of the arytenoid cartilage. These marginal samples were all found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. An R0 resection can therefore be assumed. The procedure was completed without complications. Conclusion: Overall findings-adapted paranasal sinus surgery with polypectomy. R0 resection of a pT1a vocal fold carcinoma on the right in the frozen section. A control microlaryngoscopy should be performed in 4 to 6 weeks. Depending on the patient's symptoms, sinus surgery should be discussed at intervals.","Partial laryngectomy (endoscopic laser resection)

The described tumor is seen on the anterior palatal arch with transition to the tonsillar lobe, transition to the alveolar ridge, reaching down to the glossoalveolar groove and extending to the base of the tongue. This is followed by transoral resection of the tumor with the electric needle with a safety margin of at least 1 cm on all sides. Tissue is removed from the alveolar ridge, whereby the periosteal layer can be almost completely preserved. Further development of the tumor with removal of the tonsil loge and part of the pharyngeal wall as well as part of the base of the tongue. Tumor is thread-marked. Subsequent sampling of the margin on the right from the alveolar ridge to the glossoalveolar groove. Margin samples are thread-marked with the thread-marked tumor preparation for frozen section. Here, tumor specimen on all sides in healthy tissue, somewhat narrow laterally. In combination with the lateral margin specimen, which shows no tumor infiltrates, then definitely R0. Careful hemostasis follows. Insertion of swabs. Now repositioning, injection of a total of 15 ml Ultracaine 1 % with adrenaline into both sides of the neck. Skin disinfection, sterile draping. Neck dissection on both sides, starting with the right side: skin incision in typical manner. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid process. Preservation of the external jugular vein.

This is passed underneath, clamped off, severed and supplied with puncture ligatures. Subsequent exposure of the trachea. Entry into the trachea in the 2nd/3rd intercartilaginous space, the skin is mobilized a little beforehand. Subsequent insertion into the trachea, creation of a broadly pedicled, modified Björk flap. This is then epithelized without any problems and with little tension. A size 8 tracheal cannula was then inserted and the enoral findings were checked again. Fresh blood was visible from the nose and mouth, so the Mc Ivor blade was inserted again. No bleeding was visible transorally in the wound bed, but there was bleeding from the nasopharynx or from the nose in the presence of mucosal swelling or conchal injury, so a merocele tamponade was inserted on both sides. This can be removed the next day if the findings are normal. Overall transoral resection of a cT2 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the right.

The above-mentioned operation was therefore indicated.,"First, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy again: The exophytic tumor is seen in the right hypopharyngeal region at the border to the oropharynx, beginning caudally, occupying the entire wall of the piriform sinus, with invasion into the right laryngeal skeleton. Tip of piriform sinus and esophageal entrance free. Base of tongue free. Therefore indication for the above-mentioned operation confirmed. The patient is now repositioned. Skin disinfection and injection of a total of 20 ml xylocaine 1% with adrenaline. Then start with the neck dissection modified radically on both sides: insertion of the apron flap in a typical subplatysmal manner up to beyond the hyoid bone and up to the submandibular gland on both sides. Then start with the right side: exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, omohyoid muscle, digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, external jugular vein, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Lymph node package from cranial to caudal must be detached from the internal jugular vein in case of strong adherence. It extends to caudal level Vb. Removal of the dorsal neck specimen, taking level V with it. Accessory nerve is exposed and preserved. The anterior neck specimen is then removed. Neck dissection on the left side: This is performed in the same way as on the right side. Overall evacuation level II to V as on the opposite side. Now laryngectomy with subtotal pharyngectomy: Prelaryngeal fatty tissue is also removed as part of the level VI neck dissection. Hyoid bone is detached from the suprahyoid musculature. Exposure of the pharyngeal wall. Pre-epiglottic fatty tissue is removed. Exposure of the superior cornu on both sides and dissection of the constrictor pharyngeal muscle, whereby this is mainly done on the left side. Dissection is omitted on the right side if there is a tumor. Dissection of the piriform sinus on the left. Caudal dissection of the thyroid gland on both sides. Tracheostomy and intubation. Insertion of laryngectomy tube. Subsequent paramedian insertion at epiglottis level. Dissection of lingual mucosa. Exposure of the epiglottis. The tumor is visible, which begins just below and medially in the epiglottis area. Tumor grows cranially in the direction of the tonsil lobe. Located approx. 1 cm away from the tumor, satellites can be seen in the caudal ................ area of the tonsillar lobe. These are cut around with a safety margin of 1 cm and removed. There are also satellites in the area of the posterior hypopharyngeal wall, so that the posterior hypopharyngeal wall must be subtotally removed. There is also a satellite focus in the arytenoid region on the left side. This results in a laryngectomy and a subtotal pharyngectomy. Laryngectomy specimen is thread-marked. Marginal samples are taken cranially laterally with marking towards the base of the tongue and cranially medially (marking of the tonsil lobe) as well as from the remaining hypopharyngeal wall up to the postcricoid area. Suture marking here as well. Small nodular infiltrations of an invasive tumor in the posterior hypopharyngeal wall in the specimen. Remaining margins and all marginal samples free. A resection in the postcricoid region and posterior hypopharyngeal wall as well as a margin specimen in this area is performed to be on the safe side. Tumor-free in the frozen section. It can now be definitively assumed that the resection is R0. This is followed by irrigation of the entire wound area. Due to the size of the defect after subtotal pharyngectomy and resection of the oropharynx up to the tonsil lobe and palatal arch, indication for defect coverage. The area in the right thigh was already sterilely draped at the time of insertion. The antero-lateral femoral flap is now removed: mark the spina and lateral edge of the patella. Locate the perforators along this line with the Doppler and mark them. These are located in a typical position or slightly cranial to it. The size of the flap was measured beforehand and is recorded in a length of 10 cm and a width of 4 to 8 mm according to the shape of the defect. Cut around the flap medially up to the fascia. Push the flap in the direction of the perforator. Identification of the rectus muscle and lateral vastus. Expose the perforators and the vascular pedicle. Cut around the flap caudally and laterally up to the fascia and dissect up to the septum. Expose the pedicle caudally and tie it under with ligatures. Successive development of the musculo-fasciocutaneous flap while carefully preserving the musculocutaneous perforators. If necessary, the vastus lateralis muscle is also removed. Finally, complete the cranial incision after the course of the perforators has been secured. Subsequent exposure of the pedicle. This consists of a strong ramus descendens and 2 strong accompanying veins. The artery is placed shortly before entering the profunda femoris artery. The 2nd artery is supplied with a stitching suture. 2 accompanying veins are placed before entering the profunda femoris vein or .........circumflexa iliaca and supplied with ligatures. The flap is flushed with heparin. Careful hemostasis is performed in the area of the thigh and the wound is closed in layers with the insertion of a Redon drain. The defect is then covered with a thigh flap: Fitting the flap into the defect. This fits without tension. Successive suturing using Vicryl 3/0 single button sutures. Flap can be sutured in without tension. Subsequent dissection of the vascular pedicle. The superior thyroid artery and the outlet of a superior thyroid vein from the internal jugular vein are dissected in good time. Subsequent conditioning and preparation of the flap vessels. Suture of the superior thyroid artery to the descending ramus with Ehtilon 8/0 using the end-to-end technique. After opening the clamp, good arterial flow and good venous return. Subsequent selection of the larger vein with better venous return. After measuring, selection of a coupler size 3 mm. Connection of the vessels using the coupler. Good venous return after opening the artery. Alignment test positive. The 2nd vein is closed using clips. Subsequent irrigation of the wound area. Careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers and insertion of a Redon drain into each side of the neck and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. Marking of the vessels for Doppler monitoring. Insertion of a 10 mm tracheal cannula, which is fixed with sutures. Good Doppler signal at the end of the operation. Completion of the procedure without complications. Patient goes to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Please administer antibiotics with Unacid 3 x 3 g per day for one week. .............. via the inserted PEG for 10 days.

Detachment of the suprahyoid muscles from the hyoid bone. Exposure of the .........superior on the left. Dissection of the pharyngeal tube. Dissect the thyroid gland caudolaterally on both sides. Subsequent exposure of the epiglottis from the left. Entering the pharyngeal space. It can be seen that the tumor on the left has grown almost to the base of the tongue. Partial resection of the base of the tongue from the middle to the right is therefore performed. The tumor is resected macroscopically with a safety margin of 1.5 cm on all sides. The entire pharyngeal wall on the left and caudal parts of the base of the tongue are resected. Caudally, the mucosa in the postcricoid area is removed. On the left side, the hypopharynx can be preserved as far as possible. Finally, the larynx and parts of the pharynx are removed. Due to the expansion at the base of the tongue, an extensive marginal sample is taken from the entire base of the tongue. Both the main specimen and the marginal specimen in the base of the tongue are sent in marked with sutures for frozen sectioning. Here, marginal samples of the base of the tongue are free, but there are still infiltrates at the transition from the base of the tongue or epiglottis to the lateral pharyngeal wall on the right. Therefore, another extensive resection of the mucosa on the right and removal of a marginal sample from the point where the base of the tongue was free down to almost the transition to the postcricoid area. Here the marginal sample was then subsequently free, so now R0 resection. Ultimately, the resection extends cranially to the tonsillar lobe to just under the palatal arch. Flap coverage is therefore necessary to enable tension-free closure, especially after radiation. Due to the overall situation and the good conditions in the area of the chest wall, the decision was made to elevate a pectoralis major flap to cover the defect, from the right side. Then lift and suture the pectoralis major flap. Lifting the pectoralis major flap: Locate the lateral end of the pectoralis major in the line connecting the axilla and the lower edge of the sternum. Dissection of a deltopectoral flap and undermining of the skin until a complete hand fits through. Now locate the pedicle. Measure the length of the flap with a compress and mark the skin area. Now cut around the skin area and dissect through the subcutaneous fatty tissue. The pectoralis major muscle is now separated from the chest along the lateral muscle edge to create the myofasciocutaneous flap. Suture with Vicryl 4-0 to prevent shearing. Successive further elevation of the flap with dissection along and through the pectoralis major muscle. The pedicle is visible the entire time and can be spared without any problems. Once the length of the flap is sufficient, fold it over and suture it in inverted form onto the remaining pharyngeal tube. Suture the muscles to the prevertebral fascia on both sides. A Provox is not inserted in the case of post-radiation. Insertion of 2 Redon drains in the chest as well as one Redon drain cervical right and one Redon drain cervical left. Two-layer wound closure of both the breast defect and the cervical defect on both sides. Careful suturing of the tracheostoma. Suturing of a 10-gauge ruffled cannula and suturing of this. Completion of the operation. The patient should continue to receive antibiotics with Unacid 3 g. An X-ray gruel swallow is possible after 14 days at the earliest. Subsequent irrigation of the wound area. Hemostasis and wound closure in layers, with insertion of two Redon drains into the side of the neck and epithelialization of the tracheostoma. The procedure was completed without complications. PEG placement was attempted intraoperatively, but was not possible due to insufficient diaphanoscopy. Therefore, please register patients for PEG placement in the surgery department or in Medical Clinic 1 at intervals. Until then, nutrition via the inserted gastric tube. Total second carcinoma of the hypopharynx R0-resected with partial pharyngectomy and laryngectomy. A myotomy was created on the left side to facilitate passage later. On the advice of the phoniatrists, a Provox prosthesis was not inserted. This should also be inserted at intervals. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Please continue antibiotics for one week. X-ray pelvic examination after 14 days, then, if necessary, a diet. Presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference to determine further treatment. If nodes on the left are positive, radiochemotherapy will probably be necessary.","Resection, Left-sided neck dissection (0/2), Defect coverage, Pedicled flap (Pectoralis major), Tracheotomy

Initially, the patient was scheduled for laser resection and neck on both sides.","First, induction of anesthesia by the anesthesia colleagues. First pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: The described tumor is found in the hypopharynx on the left, but it is larger and more massive than expected, above all it reaches a thickness and shows submucosal growth size, rather cT2 and growth towards the tip of the sinus as well as towards the aryepiglottic fold and towards the thyroid cartilage. Overall, no indication for laser resection, therefore indication for transoral surgery with subsequent flap coverage. Then sterile washing and draping in the neck area and performance of a tracheotomy by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: injection of 5 ml Ultracaine with Suprarenin additive along the skin incision. Now incision with the 15 mm scalpel and skin incision. Longitudinally directed approx. 5 cm long between cricoid and jugulum. Very short and thick neck. Sharp cutting of skin and platysma. Dissection in depth. Easy exposure of the linea alba. Dissection of this, exposure of the thyroid capsule. Entering with the Overholt clamp and passing under the isthmus. Bipolar coagulation of the isthmus of the thyroid gland. Exposure of the trachea and insertion with the pointed scissors between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring using Ethibond suture Creation of a mucocutaneous anastomosis. Now gastroscopy and PEG insertion: Now enter with the gastroesophagoscope and advance into the stomach with air insufflation. Once in the stomach, the stomach is inflated. A spontaneous diaphanoscopy is seen below the costal arch. A PEG is also inserted here using the thread pull-through method. There are no complications. The patient received clindamycin 600 mg perioperatively due to an allergy to amoxicillin and penicillin. Then, the Kleinsasser tube and the spreading laryngoscope were inserted and the tumor was inspected by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. The tumor was significantly larger than previously described and could no longer be resected by laser. The decision was therefore made to perform a transcervical tumor resection using flap coverage. Repositioning of the patient and sterile draping of all relevant surgical areas. First, creation of an apron flap in the typical manner up to the level of the hyoid bone or submandibular gland. Then radical neck dissection on the left by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: Lymph node conglomerate is seen cranially, which infiltrates the sternocleidomastoid muscle. First visualization of the V. facialis from cranial to caudal until it flows into the V. jugularis interna, here already caking with the lymph node conglomerate is visible. Therefore, exposure of the internal jugular vein further caudally, here some outlets to the thyroid gland can be dissected and preserved, as well as other jugular outlets. Further dissection cranially shows infiltration into the wall. Resection is therefore now necessary. The facial vein is ligated first. Subsequent medial exposure of the common carotid artery, external carotid artery and internal carotid artery; these can each be dissected, as can the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Then cranial exposure of the internal jugular vein successively after dissection of the lymph node conglomerate of the digastric muscle. The hypoglossal nerve can also be dissected here. Then caudal transection of the internal jugular vein and double ligation, once using the puncture technique. The caudal branches can remain intact. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is then severed. This is also resected from the cranial side near the insertion. The accessory nerve runs into the lymph node conglomerate and cannot be preserved. Exposure of the upper part of the internal jugular vein close to the base of the skull, which is then ligated twice and removed. The remaining parts of levels II to V are then evacuated, exposing and preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Here too, several positive lymph nodes, especially in level V. Overall, several lymph node metastases clinically clearly on the left. Clearing of the anterior neck specimen with visualization and preservation of the superior thyroid artery. Then transcervical resection of the hypopharyngeal carcinoma with partial laryngeal resection by <CLINICIAN_NAME>: First visualization of the hyoid bone and dissection of the muscles. Hyoid bone is resected. Infrahyoid muscles are cut down caudally with the thyroid lobe including the superior thyroid artery. Pharyngeal wall is exposed. The carotid artery is looped with the vagus nerve using the vessel loop and pulled slightly to the side; the superior laryngeal nerve is also exposed and pulled cranially using the vessel loop. Then enter the pharyngeal space at the level of the hyoid bone. Exposure of the tumor. The tumor is then cut around with a safety margin of 1.5 to 2 cm on all sides. The posterior wall of the hypopharynx, the piriform sinus up to the esophageal entrance or tip of the sinus, as well as part of the arytenoid fold, tumor also grows posteriorly towards the thyroid cartilage, therefore lateral resection of approx. 50 % to 60 % of the thyroid cartilage. A macroscopic resection is achieved well within the healthy tissue. The tumor is finally marked with sutures. A marginal sample is taken from the arytenoid region up to the piriform sinus entrance from the medial side. Like the specimen, this is also thread-marked for frozen section evaluation. In the frozen section, both the tumor and the marginal sample are healthy. Therefore R0 resection. Subsequent careful hemostasis and irrigation of the wound area. Neck dissection on the right side through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. After creating the apron flap, sharply dissect the skin platysma flap with the scalpel. The external jugular vein is not exposed. The auricularis magnus nerve is exposed and cut. Dissection along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in depth, the accessorius nerve is exposed and spared. The posterior abdomen of the digastric muscle is also exposed, the submandibular gland is seen medially, which is also exposed without difficulty. The omohyoid muscle is shown caudally, which represents the borders of the neck dissection. Here as a vascular sheath directly in the depth below the neck preparation. The internal jugular vein is exposed from caudal to cranial, there is no injury to the structures here. The superior thyroid vein and the facial vein are dissected and spared. The external and internal carotid arteries, the vagus nerve and the cervical artery are exposed medial to the jugular vein. The neck preparation is now detached in level IIb, followed by level IIa, sparing the accessorius nerve. Levels III, IV and V are also detached without difficulty. The plexus branches are visualized and specifically protected. A chyle fistula occurs caudally when the preparation is removed. The anterior neck preparation is now almost exposed and dissected along the V. facialis and the V. thyroidea superior. Removal of the split skin: A split skin from the left thigh measuring 11 x 8 cm is easily removed using a dermatome. Then lift the radialis graft parallel to it, here see the corresponding dictation by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Palpatory identification of the distal radial artery. Marking of the flap boundaries (8.5 x 14 cm) on the distal forearm, proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with an S-shaped incision running proximally into the cubital fossa. Incision of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue starting proximally. Identification and visualization of the venous confluence in the cubital fossa. Identification of the cephalic vein and dissection of the vein distally with integration into the radial graft margin. Identification of the ramus externus of the radial nerve and elevation of the radial portion, leaving the peritendineum of the tendons of the brachioradialis muscle intact. Subsequent ulnar incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the fascia and subsequent subfascial elevation of the ulnar edge of the graft up to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Care is taken to leave the peritendineum on the flexor tendons and to spare the ulnar artery. Identification of the distal radial artery and trial clamping with a vascular clamp. After 5 minutes with good oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (measured on the index finger), the vessels are removed with subsequent ligation (Prolene 6.0). Successive detachment of the flap pedicle from the M. pronator quadratus and M. flexor pollicis longus with ligation of the outgoing perforators using a vessel clip into the cubital fossa. Exposure and protection of the radial nerve on the medial side of the brachioradialis muscle. Exposure of the brachial artery, V. mediana cubiti, A. ulnaris. First removal of the radial artery, then of two veins of the superficial venous system. Vascular ligation by means of a bypass ligature (artery) and vascular clip (veins). Subtle hemostasis in the area of the wound bed using bipolar coagulation forceps. Two-layer wound closure in the area of the proximal forearm. Covering of the graft bed with split skin from the right thigh in the usual manner. Suturing of preparation swabs. Application of a wound dressing and a forearm splint. Completion of the graft lift without complications. Removal of the radialis graft by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and beginning with the arterial anastomosis to the superior thyroid artery. Then 3 venous anastomoses twice to the facial vein and then additionally to a direct outlet to the internal jugular vein. Then insertion of the graft into the defect and suturing of the graft, which is relatively difficult, especially in the area of the base of the tongue, due to existing tension. The graft is slightly too wide in the upper area and also in the lower area. The graft still needs to be trimmed slightly at the esophageal entrance. This is possible as the anastomosis is already in place. Then sutures are placed and the esophageal entrance is reconstructed using the radialis graft. Then successive suturing of the remaining graft in the pharyngeal and tongue base area. The flap stalk itself is extremely thick due to severe adiposity on the forearm, making it relatively difficult to integrate the raised skin monitor into the suture. Initially, an attempt is made to cut an additional hole in the apron flap and pull the skin monitor through, but this causes tension and twisting in the flap handle, so this is removed again and the hole is sutured. The skin monitor is ultimately integrated into the skin suture next to the tracheostoma. The tracheostoma was sutured with Ethibond sutures. At the end, 2 flaps are inserted on both sides and the wound is closed in two layers in the neck area. Insertion of a tracheostomy tube. Suturing of a tracheostomy tube and the patient is ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Please continue antibiotics for at least 3 days. Daily flap checks on the skin monitor, if necessary also directly via a mouth spatula. In addition, a marker was placed for a Doppler so that the flap can be checked three times. Flap control according to the usual scheme.","Tumor resection, Tracheostomy, PEG placement, Defect coverage, Free flap (Radial)

Palpation revealed an intraparotid mass on the right side measuring approx. 2 x 3 cm. Sonography revealed an unclear mass on the right cervical side (level II) with contact to the lower pole of the right parotid gland, with a suspected lateral neck cyst (DD parotid cyst). Therefore, the indication was to perform extirpation of the unclear mass and, depending on the intraoperative findings, to perform a tonsillectomy or parotid surgery if necessary.","After problem-free induction of anesthesia and intubation of the patient by the anesthesia colleagues, the patient was initially positioned. Injection of 8 ml xylocaine with added adrenaline at the level of the described level II mass on the right, after disinfection. Then ablation of the surgical site. Sterile draping. The skin incision is then made at the level of the level II right cervical mass with a length of approx. 5 cm at the level of a skin fold approx. 2 transverse fingers below the mandibular branch. Cut through the skin of the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle. While spreading the tissue, expose the auricularis magnus muscle. Finally, exposing the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle while protecting it. Further dissection in depth and finally locating the capsule of the cystic mass. Finally, the capsule of the cystic mass can be visualized, which appears to be generally plump and elastic. During further dissection, however, the capsule tears and a serous milky secretion is discharged. The mass is then dissected free from the surrounding tissue along its capsule. It can be seen that the mass, especially the cranial part, lies against the lower pole of the parotid gland on the right side. Dorsally, the accessorius nerve can be visualized and traced cranially, which descends into the depths below the digaster muscle shown. Finally, the internal jugular vein can be visualized below the digaster muscle. Further mobilization of the mass reveals a mass medially of the mass, directly adjacent to it, which corresponds clinically to a lymph node. Therefore, an atypically located lateral neck cyst is suspected. Finally, the cystic mass is successfully removed after spreading the surrounding tissue, sparing the accessorius and auricular nerves as well as the internal jugular vein. No duct structure can be traced or visualized in the direction of the tonsillar lobe. Finally, hemostasis, dry wound conditions. Then insertion of an 8-gauge Redon drain and two-layer wound closure as well as a sterile wound dressing. Finally, the tonsillectomy was performed on the right side. For this, the patient was positioned head down and a Mc Ivor spatula was inserted. Inspection of the right tonsil lobe, which is fissured and relatively atrophic and small. The mucosal incision is then made loco typico close to the uvula, in the area of the anterior palatal arch, cranially in an envelope fold. The tonsil capsule and the upper pole of the right tonsil are then exposed. Bipolar coagulation of the feeding tonsil vessels and sharp transection, the capsule is then peeled out of its tonsil bed after extending the mucosal incisions caudally and deposited at the lower pole. After extensive bipolar coagulation of the feeding cords at the caudal pole. Finally, extensive hemostasis by means of bipolar coagulation and insertion of an H2O2-soaked swab. After removal of the swab and a relaxation time of approx. 5 min, the tonsil lobe on the right is dry. The procedure is then completed. Summarizing remarks: During the operation, a cystic mass was extirpated on the right cervical side (level II) and a right tonsillectomy was performed if an atypical lateral neck cyst was suspected. The inserted Redon drainage can be removed on the 2nd postoperative day.","Tonsillectomy (without adenotonsillectomy): With dissection technique

A tumor of the anterior commissure is seen here, which is mainly located in the anterior third of the left vocal fold and then reaches the right vocal fold via the anterior commissure and also appears to infiltrate it. The patient is extremely difficult to adjust, which is why an external resection is indicated due to the tumor location and adjustability. The patient is therefore first repositioned and local anesthetic with adrenaline is injected. Then a zigzag-shaped prelaryngeal incision is made. Layered preparation in depth. Ligation of larger veins. Then exposure of the laryngeal skeleton. Exposure of the cricoid cartilage and exposure of the ligamentum conicum. Transverse incision of the ligamentum conicum and subsequent execution of the thyrofissure. This is performed in the midline. Then open the endolarynx in the anterior commissure. The tumor described above can be seen on the left side and in the anterior part of the right side. The tumor is then undermined at the base of the thyroid cartilage and initially detached. The tumor is then resected tangentially with a sufficient safety margin on the left side. The specimen is suture-marked with the caudal, dorsal and cranial suture markings for the frozen section. These resection margins are all found to be tumor-free in the frozen section. Then take a marginal sample from the anterior commissure at the caudal deposition area. This is also tumor-free in the frozen section. Then move to the right side and also undermine the tumor on the perichondrium. Here too, tangential resection of the tumor with a sufficient safety margin. In the dorsal settling area, take a marginal sample, which is also assessed as tumor-free in the frozen section. Then fixation of the vocal fold on the right side at the anterior commissure, which had been detached here. To do this, two mattress sutures were placed on the anterior edge of the thyroid cartilage in the area of the thyrofissure line. Then adaptation of the resection margins in the area of the separation on the left vocal fold. Here too, mobilization of the soft tissue and suturing anteriorly to the thyrofissure margin. Then measure a laryngeal larynx. This is then inserted in a size of 14 mm and the thyroid cartilage is adapted. Then suture the ligamentum conicum. Suture of the prelaryngeal musculature. Subsequent two-layer wound closure after insertion of a wound flap and application of a pressure bandage. Final discussion with the anesthesia colleagues. Due to the location and adjustability, this tumor of the anterior commissure as well as the left vocal fold and the anterior part of the right vocal fold had to be resected from the outside. Based on the representative marginal samples, the specimen shows an R0 resection.
